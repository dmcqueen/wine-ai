Vanilla, coconut, caramel and lightly buttered almonds all contribute to the nuanced detail.",Germaine Vineyard,92,25.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Viognier,Cristom
74998,US,"A good followup to last year's bottling, although the wine isn't quite as ripe and lush. The cool vintage has brought out a tannic earthiness, as well as a blast of black pepper that makes the blackberry and blueberry fruit tingly on the tongue. It's a complicated, individualistic wine, and you might want to cellar it for up to six years and see what happens.",,92,45.0,California,Atlas Peak,Napa,Syrah,Aril
74999,US,"This could be the best Pinot Blanc in Oregon right now, with lushness from barrel fermentation offset by the delicate balance throughout.

75016,US,"This would seem to reflect a fairly significant stylistic shift from previous vintages. Here the influence of malolactic fermentation yields a soft, buttery wine with aromas of microwave popcorn.

76539,US,"A nice, lower-alcohol (14.1%) alternative to the world of big California Barbera. This one, from Lodi's Sorelle, has aromas reminiscent of sweet flowers.

76542,US,"With 13% Cabernet Franc in the blend, this has significant heft and a dark streak with flavors of herb, bark and fungus.

76546,US,"Except for a splash of Syrah, this qualifies as a Cabernet-centric Bordeaux-style blend. Hard to find a better bottle of blended red wine at the price.

76547,Italy,This is a good portrait of Nebbiolo save for a pungent touch of powder or solvent that distracts from the overall harmony of fruit. Those strong elements are not outside the great boundaries of this important native Italian grape and are more than forgiven in this case.,Bricco Faset,87,,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,La Spinona

76554,Croatia,"Pronounced aromas of charred wood are imposing on the nose, but intense black fruit shines through on the palate, taming char into a more palatable blend of rich blackberry preserves, smoke and barnyard.

76563,Italy,"Made with a 70-30 blend of Montepulciano and Nero di Troia grapes (the first adds softness and the latter gives structure), Rupicolo is a bargain buy and a great pairing partner to oven-roasted pasta or meatloaf.

The wine ends with a hint of chopped herb or smoked bacon.",Mastro,87,,Southern Italy,Campania,,Red Blend,Mastroberardino
76568,US,"A controversial wine, tasted twice. It's soft and tannic, with candied cherry-berry, mocha and sweet oak flavors. Seems at once dull and powerful.

76583,US,"Very dry and tannic. Treads the line between elegant and boring. Some good cherry and blackberry flavors erupt midpalate, but it's really a fairly lean, earthy Cabernet.

76590,France,"Heavily toasty wood dominated wine, which makes it one-dimensional. It has enough juicy fruit, although this will need at least six years for it to really makes its presence. Less wood would help the balance.",Cuvée Divin,88,,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Château les Croisille

76600,US,"A funky undertone, similar to the Nicholas Estate bottling, weaves through the wine, along with a mix of cranberry, raspberry and sour cherry fruit.

76601,US,"Similar in style to the winery's Cuvée A bottling, this had a little higher percentage of new French oak (still just one quarter total), and brings an earthier style to bear.

77223,New Zealand,"Possibly just in a sullen phase, this reserve bottling from Craggy's home vineyard is dominated for the moment by smoke and cedar on the nose, and while there is some cherry fruit apparent in the mouth, it doesn't appear to be fully expressing itself.

77240,US,"Beautifully perfumed with luscious stonefruit and a hint of jasmine blossoms, but not at all cloying, this off-dry Riesling is another favorite from Hermann J. Wiemer.

77432,Greece,"This white blend offers bright aromas and flavors of grapefruit, pear and green apple. There's also an interesting floral note here as well which balances the leaner fruits.

77433,Italy,"This easy expression of Nebbiolo from Cascina Adelaide shows slightly disjointed tones of cherry and toasted oak (like the aromas you get with freshly sawed wood) and a short, clean close. Those toasted notes seem a bit heavy on the light frame of fruit offered here.",,86,35.0,Piedmont,Langhe,,Nebbiolo,Cascina Adelaide
77434,Italy,"Here is a simple, informal expression of Barbera that ushers forth bright aromas of forest fruit, cola and dried currants. Those ripe berry flavors are ultimately washed away by the wine's fresh acidity.",Piagè,86,,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,,Barbera,Cascina La Ghersa

Finishes dry, with a tobacco note.",Axel,86,20.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,La Playa
77437,Chile,"Oceanic and green, with lots of pop and Sauvignon character. The palate is tight, linear and citric, with sharp acidity.

77439,US,"Feels heavy and soft, and tastes rather sweet and extracted in jammy blackberry, cherry and chocolate flavors. Yet the tannins are smooth and refined.

Brings bite and a dusting of green chile spice on the finish.",Reserva Sauvignon Blanc-Carmenére,86,12.0,Maule Valley,,,White Blend,Oveja Negra
77442,Italy,"Earthy, rusty notes open this Roero Riserva and segue to dark fruit and prune. This Nebbiolo-based wine does, however, present a softer, more yielding mouthfeel than you might expect for the naturally astringent grape variety.",Riserva,86,,Piedmont,Roero,,Nebbiolo,Pace
77443,US,"Bone dry and tart, with a real bite. Technically, the acidity isn't terribly high, but for whatever reason the wine tastes sharp. The cherry flavors have pretty mushroom and mineral complexities.",Griva Vineyard,86,38.0,California,Arroyo Seco,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Mercy

77449,Chile,"A super pungent style of SB that will knock you over with nettle, grapefruit, passion fruit and sweaty aromas.

77450,Chile,"Lemon, apple and other standard aromas give it a familiar if unspectacular opening. The palate is full, mildly creamy and offers decent acidity in support of peach and nectarine flavors.

77452,Italy,"This Riserva Roero is a low-key wine with subtle fruit and spice characteristics wrapped around a thin, streamlined mouthfeel.

77454,Lebanon,"Curious on the nose with hints of orange peels, resin and a dusty, floral aroma, the 2004 Gaston Horchar shows a subdued fruit and floral quality that's faded from the 2003.

Round and rich with an umami-laden finish.",Gaston Hochar,86,46.0,Bekaa Valley,,,White Blend,Château Musar

77456,New Zealand,"Essentially a second label for Vavasour, the 2010 Dashwood Sauvignon Blanc displays restrained gooseberry aromas that turn tropical and citrusy on the palate.

77457,Italy,"Briccoserra (a blend of red grapes from Piedmont in northern Italy) offers awkward aromas of mature fruit and smoked meat, along the lines of honey baked ham or cured beef. You can feel the heat in the mouth and the bold intensity of the structure.",Briccoserra,86,52.0,Piedmont,Langhe,,Red Blend,Cigliuti
77458,US,"This is for acid lovers only. Tart almost to the point of sourness, it is saved by its sharply etched green apple crispness.

77464,US,"As is often the case with Rogue Valley wines, the tannins are dominant and abrasive.

The tannins, acids and darker flavors rule, creating a wine with rigid structure and a tight, firm finish.",,87,28.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Southern Oregon,Cabernet Sauvignon,Del Rio
77465,US,"With alcohol at just 12.7%, this is one of several under-13% Pinots tasted recently that seem to be setting a new trend in Oregon.

77466,Italy,"Caiatì is an interesting and unique expression of Pallagrello that does an excellent job of offering both aromatics and structure. Notes of melon, peach and apricot are followed by smooth creaminess and density.",Caiatì,87,,Southern Italy,Campania,,Pallagrello,Fattoria Alois
77467,Italy,"From the rare Pallagrello grape, this is a wine that will appeal to those looking for new tastes from Italy. You can feel the alcohol here but the heat is downplayed by the wine's naturally thick and rich texture.

77476,Chile,"Toasty but nice on the nose, with mineral, lemon, green banana and melon aromas to ponder. The palate is full but low in acidity, thus it's soft and starting to fade.

77482,US,"A strong, bold young wine, with good varietal flavors of blackberries and black currants.

77489,South Africa,"There's not a ton of assertive character to this wine aside from its gripping tannins and firm structure. The fruit is faint and shy, with notes of dark berries, black tea and licorice spice hiding in the background.

77490,Argentina,"Light, airy, tropical and very nice for an under-$10 Argentine Chardonnay.

77494,Argentina,"Initially it smells flat and earthy, with raisiny black fruit aromas. As it airs out it improves, but throughout its run it comes across heavy and wayward, with raisiny flavors and a simple dullness that prevents the wine from rising to the next level.

77498,US,"Rich as can be, but oak dominates, giving the wine buttered toast and caramelized vanilla flavors, and you'll even find notes of buttered popcorn.

77500,Argentina,"By all accounts, 2008 was a tough vintage with cool weather, stunting frosts and ripeness issues. This wine seems afflicted: its opening is good, with coconut and floral shadings.

77520,Spain,"Floral fruit aromas suggest blueberry, but overall this vintage lacks the power and depth that Termes and its big brothers are known for. Airing sets up sweet, easygoing berry flavors and full tannins, but in the middle it's less whole than it has been in other years.

77628,US,"An early freeze shut down the vineyards in 2009, and produced wines that are less immediately generous than the ripe, fruit-driven 2008s.

78331,Argentina,"As the higher-end 2008s hit the market, the vintage's underwhelming character is confirmed via wines like this. Oaky and rubbery on the nose, with scattered, lean berry fruit flavors and bitterness. Like many '08s, it's short on richness and comes across unfocused. That said, it's still a good wine that's not badly made.",Signature,87,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Susana Balbo

78337,Argentina,"Given the difficulties of 2008, this is a commendable, drinkable wine. The nose is full and dark, with ripe berry aromas.

78964,US,"Vinified in California with grapes purchased from Willamette Valley sources, this is a pleasant, quaffable wine, with simple red fruit and grippy acids.

Deep plum and black cherry flavors are driving this wine, which opens with a quick burst of juicy fruits, swathed in tart, citrusy acids.

80268,US,"Though the vineyard sources—Stillwater and Conner Lee—are first-rate, this wine seems a bit disjointed at the moment. Sweet, juicy fruit opens up into a midpalate that seems to have a hole, and then the aggressive flavors of vanilla surface. The vanilla-tinged finish feels tacked on, though perhaps some further bottle age will help to smooth it.",Reserve,87,50.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Woodinville Wine Cellars
80269,France,"New wood dominates this soft wine. The fruit is round and smoky, featuring notes of black cherries and red plums that fall behind a toasty caramel sweetness.

80286,US,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Zinfandel reflects the change in ownership (from Diageo to Precept), rather than a specific new direction for the winery.

It's rich and complex in cherry, spice and oak flavors, with an umami taste of cured meat, and the tannins are rich and firm. The wine shows the crisp, mouthwatering acidity of Carneros, especially in this cool vintage. Drink now–2013 for freshness.",Truchard Vineyard,92,65.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Merlot,Carter
81757,US,"A wonderful, amazingly rewarding wine, certainly one of California's best Albariños. If there's any oak at all, it's insignificant. What stars is brilliant Edna Valley acidity and racy flavors of citrus fruits, pears, white flowers and white peppery spices. The perfect cocktail wine.",Paragon Vineyard,92,17.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Albariño,Tangent
81758,US,"An elegant, compelling Chardonnay, its fruit accented with lemon, honey and lime. Low cropping of Dijon clone 76 has concentrated the flavors (and the alcohol—a surprising 15.7%) without turning the wine into an overblown fat boy. Nuanced and long, it is one of the most satisfying Chardonnays to come out of Oregon in recent memory.",Crawford Beck Vineyard,92,24.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay,Seven of Hearts
81759,France,"Not a typical Crozes-Hermitage, Jaboulet's Domaine de Roure is a showcase for what the appellation is capable of.

81761,France,"Old vines give just an extra edge of concentration to go with the balanced red berry fruits and a soft acidity. This fine wine has weight, some richness and a crisp final texture.",Vieilles Vignes,91,15.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence La Londe,,Rosé,Domaine Saint-André de Figuière
81762,US,"A block selection from the estate, this is an intense, flattering Chardonnay.

Brisk acidity brings welcome balance to the richness.",M,91,48.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse
81763,US,"Nearly five years of age, and giving its best. Slowly losing berry fruit, it's turning dry and mushroomy.

81764,US,"Dark, spicy and deeply flavored, this Cabernet is dense and concentrated in blackberry and cassis flavors, with a stony minerality at its core. The fruit is so ripely expansive, it tastes sweet on the finish, yet the wine is utterly dry. It's good now despite the hard mountain tannins, but should begin to blossom after 2014.",Bismark Mountain Vineyard,91,54.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hanna

81767,US,"Very similar to the 2006, Kameron's '07 Bordeaux blend, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is upfront in blackberry, cherry, cassis, oak and spice flavors. It's quite tannic, with a puckery astringency that suggests needed time in the cellar. Better after 2014.",Cuvée Kristin Estate Blend,91,55.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Korbin Kameron
81768,US,"An enormous Cabernet. Explodes with flavors of blackberries, cassis and chocolate, as well as the sweet vanilla and toast from oak barrels.

Worth aging another year to bring its great flavors together.",Casa de Santar Condessa de Santar,91,35.0,Dão,,,Portuguese White,Dão Sul
81771,Argentina,"Deep and lush, with aromas of blackberry, cassis and coffee. This is actually a better, more balanced wine than the winery's Gran Misterio because it isn't over the top and overoaked. Flavors of mocha, coffee and mulled berry are on the money, while the chocolaty finish is smooth. Drink now due to low acidity.",Misterio,91,35.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Alma Negra
81772,US,"A very rich, opulent Pinot Noir. It's almost as sweet as a dessert, like a cherry and chocolate tart, but it's actually quite dry. Crisp acidity gives it a balancing snap. Now–2014.",El Coro,91,52.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller
81773,US,"Winemaker Chris Condos appears to have the magic touch when it comes to coaxing great wines out of organic grapes in Mendocino County and this blend of Carignan Petite Sirah, Charbono, Zinfandel and Grenache is pure testament to that, a bargain bottling full of lavender and plum that presents a magical balance between flavor and grip.",Harvester Red,91,18.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Red Blend,Horse & Plow

81777,US,"Lots of zippy acidity in this fresh, dry, clean Sauvignon Blanc. It's unoaked, which allows the Meyer lemon, orange and guava fruit to star. There's a sweet vanilla taste that must come from the grapes. A beautiful, complex white wine to drink now.",Au Naturel,91,32.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Brander
81778,US,"Another successful Tannat from Cambiata, the fourth vintage in a row to score at least 90 points. The grape variety, from southwest France, produces a dry, tannic, full-bodied wine like this one. It has a stringy feel, with deep flavors of raspberries. Will age for a very long time.

The nose is earthy, herbal, roasted and tomatoey, while the palate is astringent and roasted, with herbal, spicy flavors of tomato, bell pepper and baked berries. Long and baked on the finish, with a slight fiery feel.",Amalaya,85,17.0,Other,Calchaquí Valley,,Red Blend,Colomé
81943,Italy,"Pleasing aromas of stone fruit, grapefruit and white mineral make a very nice first impression: This Soave Classico would pair perfectly with exotic dishes borrowing from Chinese or Thai culinary tradition.

81944,Argentina,"Murky and leathery on first take, with dry, earthy red fruit aromas emerging later on.

Perfectly adequate but short on stuffing and depth.",Dos Fincas,85,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Carlos Basso
81945,Argentina,"Lightly herbal and red in character, with tomato and raspberry aromas.

Snappy and pointed, with a leafy overriding personality.",,85,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Espuela del Gaucho
81946,Argentina,"Good wine but a touch stemmy and burnt smelling.

81961,Italy,"This is the wine that made Angelo Gaja a household name worldwide. Made according to Barbaresco tradition, the wine reveals itself slowly at first and doles out small aromas of wild berry, licorice, root beer, smoke and graphite that become magically more intense with time in the glass.

81965,US,"Pretty much as good as any Cabernet out there, if not better, and at a fraction of the price you'll pay for the “cults.” If there was ever a wine made for the cellar, it's this one, the antidote for those who consider California Cabernet a simple fruit bomb. Completely dry, with exquisite tannins, its blackberry, currant, red licorice and oak-inspired flavors are massive and classic. Hard to exaggerate how good this fine wine is. Drink 2013–2020 and beyond.",Black Cougar Ridge,97,75.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet
81966,US,"An absolutely first-rate Cabernet that not only shows the big tannins and ageworthiness of Howell Mountain, but is made in a dry style that calls to mind a fine Left Bank Bordeaux. It's a big wine, voluminous in tannins and extremely mouth-filling, and the blackberry and cassis flavors have elements of dried herbs, minerals, tobacco and cedar.

81974,US,"Very rich, ripe and complex, showing a near-perfect display of flavors and textures. The riper blackberries and black cherries have a chewy, meaty edge, with notes of cola and bacon.

81982,US,"This very sweet wine was harvested at 33 degrees brix, which for wine geeks means lots and lots of sugar. Honeyed flavors dominate, fruited with apricots and tangerines.

81986,US,"This Chardonnay is defined by structural qualities, such as linearity and angularity. This is due to the joining of its minerality with acidity.

81987,US,"This wine just gets better with every new vintage. Young and fresh, it hits the palate with lip-puckering acidity, rolling on flavors of lemons, oranges, citrus rind, and then into mango and papaya.

82218,US,"Give this Pinot Noir some time to breathe and mellow in a decanter. Right out of the bottle, it's tough, tannic and jammy in raspberry and cherry flavors.

82219,New Zealand,"The cherry fruit that defines this wine is almost too bright, too pure—it verges on being confected in character.

82529,US,"The 2009 vintage seems to have pushed the alcohol up a notch in many of the Ste. Michelle reds yielding dense, fruit-driven wines that are on the verge of being jammy.

82555,US,"A little unripe, with a vegetal, asparagus aroma that's off-putting.

82570,US,"Atlas Peak's reputation for Syrah can only grow as a result of this wine. It shows the massively dense fruit and firm mountain tannins of the appellation, as well as the ageability of Atlas Peak Cabernet Sauvignon, with which this Syrah could easily be confused.

Even though it's a big wine, filled with blackberry, cassis, dark chocolate and oak flavors, and the tannins are firm, it feels like pure velvet, showing pedigree all the way through the long finish.

82578,US,"Made in an exceptionally ripe manner, this Pinot brims with cherry and raspberry pie filling fruit that's so rich, it's almost like a dessert, except the finish is dry. Oak adds delicious complications of sweet, caramelized vanilla and char. This is quite a good wine, but it's a little on the young side.

82872,US,"Really delicious, a sweet, spicy, fruity wine that's like biting into a raspberry, roasted almond, vanilla and cinnamon granola candy bar. That's no insult. The wine is dry and wonderfully rich in smooth tannins, and enormously complex. Worthy of very fine steak, lamb, tuna and salmon entrees.",Sierra Madre Vineyard,93,59.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
82873,US,"It's very good, with deep, delicious flavors of tropical fruits, minerals and vanilla, accented with elaborate oak and brightened with crisp acidity. Production was a low 223 cases, but it's worth a search.",Estate,93,39.0,California,California,California Other,Chardonnay,The Mountain Winery
82874,US,"This nearly 100% Cabernet is strongly flavored, bone dry, very tannic and nowhere near ready. It has a tough, astringent mouthfeel, and the concentrated richness of grapes grown on low-yielding hillsides. Intense flavors of blackberries, black cherries, cassis, cola and herbs mark this fine, ageable wine. Don't touch it before 2013, and it should ride out many years beyond that.",Brothers Ridge,93,75.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
82875,Argentina,"Young, fiery and rugged on the nose, but with exotic notes that suggest Middle Eastern and Asian herbs and spices. Like all Cobos Malbecs, this is big, chewy, brawny and a touch medicinal, with powerful dark fruit flavors, particularly black cherry, and a good deal of licorice, chocolate and overall richness. Handles its 15% alcohol better than many heavyweights; drink now through 2013.",Marchiori Vineyard,93,190.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Viña Cobos
82876,US,"Deep and impressively focused, and long in the finish, this rich Cabernet impresses with fruity blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors.

82877,US,"Dryness and tannins mark this Cabernet, giving it some austerity and astringency. But lurking deep below the surface is a vast underground landscape of blackberry fruit, cassis, plums, olives, herbs and oak. Fascinating and intricate and a little heady, but undrinkable now due to immaturity. Needs 5–6 years to show its stuff.",Monte Rosso Vineyard,92,70.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood
82878,US,"This is one of those “best kept secrets” that pop up from time to time. The grapes come from the warm Pope Valley region, and the wine, made from free run juice, was aged in 55% new French oak. It has the feel and taste of Cabernets far more expensive. Almost overripe, it veers back at the last minute into pure, sweet blackberry essence. A great bargain, but only 317 cases were produced.",,92,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Flying Horse
82879,Spain,"Ripe and meaty, with bacon, earth, leather and inviting black fruit aromas. Not lazy at all; in fact a laser-like beam of acidity cuts through the palate, pushing bright, slightly fierce flavors of savory berry and minty oak. Finishes hot, spicy and with coffee and mocha.

82881,US,"An ambitious blend of Merlot, Tempranillo, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, grown mainly on Atlas Peak. It's bone dry and locked down in tannins and acidity, offering little relief, but there's a potent core of blackberries and black currants that yearns to bust through.

82882,US,"Late-picked, 100% Cabernet fruit from an iconic Red Mountain vineyard; hence the name, which translates as “the beast”.

A brilliant wine to drink now.",Don Miguel Vineyard,92,28.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay-Albariño,Marimar Estate
82884,US,"Very fine, showing the class of this vineyard, at a great price.

The minerality reprises throughout, giving the wine a steely authority.",Oliver's Vineyard,92,28.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Stephen Ross
82885,US,"A good amalgam of Red Mountain flavors—hard, tight tannins; dark, smoky black fruits; an underlayer of graphite and mineral. The wine is hard and compact, unyielding, but well-balanced and complete.

82886,US,"Pure Cabernet sourced from a trio of Walla Walla vineyards, and finished at 14.9% alcohol.

83160,US,"Showing an enormous blast of cherries and raspberries, this Pinot is saved from being a fruit bomb by earthy, mushroomy complexities and a hit of acidity that makes the mouth water.

84061,US,"Lovely delineation here, the berry/cherry fruit framed with coffee and chocolate from a 50/50 mix of French and American oak barrels. The surprise is the addition (via co-fermentation) of 6% Viognier, which stabilizes color and gives a pleasing, floral/citrus lift to the scents and flavors. Good balance and follow through.",Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,91,35.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Syrah,:Nota Bene
84062,US,"This is a very well-crafted wine from an important new winery on Red Mountain. Building on a terroir-driven European style pioneered by Hedges, this wine, made by the winemaking team of Pete Hedges and Sarah Goedhart, brings a perfect blend of mixed red and blue fruits, spice, juicy acidity and the indefinable “extra” depth of Red Mountain vineyard land.

Firm tannins and fine acidity give this delicious wine structure, but it's mostly notable for the extraordinary depth and length of its blackberry, currant, teriaki beef, mushroom and cedar flavors.

84339,US,"One hundred percent Syrah from the Watch Hill Vineyard, in the Los Alamos Valley section of Santa Barbara County. It's very new-oaky now, with an explosion of buttered toast, char, vanilla and wood tannins. Underneath is a funky red wine just waiting to emerge. Already showing notes of bacon, teriaki beef and massively ripe blackberries. A helluva wine, impressive and dramatic. The big question is what will it do? Should develop for an additional 4–6 years.",Kubernetes,94,75.0,California,California,California Other,Syrah,Sanguis

It's certainly a big wine that floods the mouth with blackberry, black currant, cassis and new oak flavors. The tannins and acids make it aloof, resistant, tough. It wants time in the cellar.

Black cherry, cassis, subtle notes of lavender, and a foundation of wet stone are all nicely balanced and surprisingly elegant, given the relatively high (15.1%) alcohol.

It's so rich in orange, honeydew and pineapple flavors, it might almost be Chardonnay, except it's drier and more minerally, and there's a wonderful note of dried herbs.

84728,Italy,"This is a lovely, layered wine with unusual (but seductive) aromas of cassis, wild berry, violet, chopped mint, pine nut, iron, clove and savory black pepper.

84735,Italy,"The Preda Sarmassa Barolo Riserva offers an interesting and immediate bouquet of cola, currants, dried mint, green olive and capers.

84736,Italy,"Barolo Case Nere from La Morra opens with extremely dark and concentrated extraction followed by young oak-related aromas of spice, leather and tobacco.

84743,US,"The best of Belle Glos's 2008 Pinots.

84744,US,"There's something very fine and compelling about this Merlot-based Bordeaux blend. It's powerful in oak-inspired blackberry, black cherry and black currant flavors, but even more noteworthy is the quality of the tannin structure, which is firm and classic.

Shows concentrated blackberry, black currant and violet flavors that turn sweet and chocolaty on the finish, although the wine itself is perfectly dry. Quite tannic, which suggests ageability, although high alcohol of 15.5% will be controversial in some circles.

Schram, but then the blend is the complete opposite. This one's mainly Pinot Noir, with the balance from Chardonnay. The Pinot Noir brings a warm, raspberry- and cherry-sauce richness to Chardonnay's limes and pears, while an extraordinarily delicious toastiness pervades the whole, as if it had been gently smoked.

85051,US,"Massive in chocolate, blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam intensity, this is a brilliant wine. It's so delicious that you'll want to drink the whole bottle.

85052,US,"Failla is so well known for Pinot Noir that we sometimes forget how good their estate Syrah can be. Given the vineyard's terroir, its red wines show better in cooler vintages—like 2010—while its above-the-fogline elevation encourages ripeness. This is dry, tannic and peppery, with a succulent blackberry flavor. Among the best Syrahs of the year, it's gorgeous now, and should develop over the next six years.",Estate,95,62.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Failla
85053,US,"This is an absolutely beautiful wine from a winery that's quietly been doing a great job with their Cabs. Made from grapes grown high up on Mount Veeder, which insiders know as one of Napa's premier mountain appellations, it's rich and softly refined in blackberry, blueberry, currant and chocolate flavors, with lovely minerality.

It's open-knit and soft on the nose, with ladels of spice, graphite and black fruit aromas.

Licorice, espresso and amaro notes grace the padded finish. Drink now–2018.",San Román,95,70.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Maurodos
85055,US,"This wine is entirely Cabernet, using grapes from the southerly Coombsville area and warmer St. Helena. As such, it's wonderfully balanced, with a sprightly burst of acidity brightening succulent flavors of black cherry and dark chocolate. The use of 100% new French oak sounds excessive on paper, but it's perfectly integrated, providing a jacket of sweet buttered toast that in no way overshadows the fruit.

85064,US,"This is made from fruit sourced from the oldest block of Syrah in Washington, which was planted in 1986.

85065,US,"This 100% Cabernet is soft, rich, fruity and almost sweet in ripe, jammy blackberry and cherry flavors, and that impression of sweetness is heightened by caramelized oak. Without structure, this would be a candy bar, but structure it has, and plenty of it. The acidity is firm and mouthwatering, and the tannins are wonderful.

85067,US,"Another great Hillside Select from selected blocks in Shafer's vineyard. It's a perfect illustration of the “iron fist in a velvet glove” description of Stags Leap Cabernet, with perhaps more emphasis this year on the velvet than the iron.

85068,US,"Concentrated and wonderfully aromatic, this ages for 32 months in 75% new French oak, plus another 28 months in bottle prior to its release.

85069,US,"This will be the last Ovide from En Cerise grapes. It's an explosion of cherry and milk chocolate flavors, remaining firm with expressive highlights of olive, earth and herb. It is two-thirds Cabernet and one-third Syrah, a perfect melding of the two grapes.

85071,US,"There's a smoky edge to the dark chocolate, licorice, blackberry and bacon flavors that make this especially savory.

85072,US,"A big, vital wine, mouth-filling and dense, with plenty of weight and volume, and deep flavors of earth, chocolate, blackberry and sweet currant. The cool '09 vintage has resulted in this version of Cask 23 being lighter in alcohol and tighter than others like the 2008. It's not quite as fat or immediately accessible as those vintages, but it is very fine, and should reward at least 10 years in the cellar, although you can certainly drink it now after a few hours in the decanter.",Cask 23 Estate,94,210.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars
85073,US,"Goldschmidt has held this single-vineyard Cabernet back for more than five years, an expensive proposition. And it needs even more time. Although it's magnificent, the parts haven't yet come together. It's massive in blackberry and cassis liqueur flavors, and the tannins are pure Alexander Valley—soft and herbal—but the oak sticks out like a sore thumb.

85075,US,"Very tannic, in the Laurel Glen way, this young wine's toughness is due to the estate vineyard's mountain terroir. In years past, Laurel Glen was a cult Cabernet. They perhaps dropped the ball for a while, but this wine stages a big comeback. It's rich and vital in black currant and mineral, with just the right touch of new oak, and it shows a sophistication not seen from the winery in years. And at this price, it's a bargain. Drink now–2021, as it gradually softens and sweetens.",,94,60.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Laurel Glen
85076,France,"This impressively rich wine, with impeccable balance, has acidity and ripe, spicy fruit in great accord. It's dry, with its acidity cutting through the complex texture.

85077,US,"This is a 100% Cabernet, and its tannins are so strong that it's virtually undrinkable now. It displays class in every way, with an intense concentration of cassis liqueur and blackberry that's especially deep in the middle palate, but it also persists into a long, spicy finish. It would be a pity to open it before 2018, and it has the structure to go the long haul.",Padrone,94,145.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Signorello
85078,US,"Tannic and closed now, this wine has a tough-as-nails astringency that brings to mind an older style of Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon, one that required many years of aging. However, this wine is considerably riper and fruitier than anything the mountain used to yield, testimony to modern growing and extractive measures. It is, in a word, delicious, with deep, long blackberry, black currant, crème de cassis and smoke flavors. But, like the 2007, it needs serious time in the cellar. Try after 2018.",Vintage VI,94,100.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lamborn Family Vineyards
85079,US,"There's a lot of lees influence on this wine, which gives it a sourdough taste and creamy mouthfeel.

85468,Italy,"This is a rich and deeply oak-driven expression of Brunello with layers of spice and smoke that sit heavy over ripe fruit aromas of plum, prune and black currant. The texture is smooth and rich and the tannins are soft.",Riserva,90,95.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Fattoi
85469,Italy,"Ripe and plump with pretty aromatic layers of blackberry, cherry and spice, this textbook Brunello speaks highly of the beautiful territory that shaped it. The wine is bright, crisp and a touch sour in the mouth with enduring flavors of white cherry and cassis.",,90,45.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Fattoria La Lecciaia
85470,US,"Oak dominates this 100% barrel-fermented Chardonnay, giving vanilla crème brûlée and buttered toast notes, but they marry well with the pineapple and pear tart flavors of the fruit. The overall impression is flashy and elaborate. The grapes come from the highly regarded Nielson Vineyard.",Wente Clone,94,35.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Byron
85471,Austria,"One of Austria's iconic reds, Mariental comes from a single vineyard in the hills above Rust on the Neusiedlersee. It is finely perfumed, the perfumes following through to the rich but firm palate, which is elegant and dense in texture, with ripe blueberry and strawberry fruits founded on solid tannins. Age for several years.",Ried Mariental,94,,Burgenland,,,Blaufränkisch,Ernst Triebaumer
85472,US,"The grapes come mainly from the Rancho Santa Rosa vineyard, which is a great one, source to many top-scoring Chardonnays over the years. The wine is brisk,  tart and clean, with rich, dramatic flavors of pineapple, lime, honeysuckle and buttered toast. Really elegant and wonderful, and should blossom through early 2012.",Cuvée Diana,94,36.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Longoria
85473,US,"A wonderfully rich, complex and ageworthy Cabernet. It displays the impeccable winemaking from this winery, with deep, long flavors of blackberries, currants and chocolate, and while it's drinkable now, those sturdy Diamond Mountain tannins should carry the wine forward for 6–8 years.",,94,100.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hall
85474,US,"Freshly picked blackberries that got ripe under the hot summer sun. Lots of ground black peppercorn dust. Black currant liqueur, black licorice and even a smattering of pancetta. These are the flavors of this delicious, complex Petite Sirah. It shows the big, firm tannins the variety is famous for, but they're exceptionally ripe and fine. Absolutely first-class, one of the best Petite Sirahs of the vintage, and it's not surprising that it comes from Napa Valley.",,94,36.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Petite Sirah,Titus
85475,France,"A big, burly Chablis, beautifully ripe, exhibiting powerful fruits overlaying a core of citrus and apple skin texture. The wine is open, rich, with an enticing juicy character, finished with bright, ripe acidity.",Bougros Grand Cru,94,75.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,William Fèvre

For aging.",,94,212.0,Burgundy,Echézeaux,,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils
85477,US,"New oak dominates this wine, with a rich eruption of toasted meringue, vanilla, burnt butter sauce and woodspice aromas and flavors, yet beneath that elaborate veneer is a wine that easily supports it. The fruit is fantastically concentrated, suggesting cherries and black raspberries baked into a pie—pie crust, and dusting of cinnamon sugar and cocoa included. For all that, the wine is thoroughly dry. Whoever says Merlot is dead should taste this beauty.",Truchard Vineyards,94,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Carter
85478,US,"Buying and cellaring this expensive wine requires an act of faith, because right now, it's not showing much in the way of sophistication. It's massive in fruit, exploding on the palate with in-your-face blackberries, black currants and cherries, not to mention caramelized oak. It's almost rude. Your only choice is to age it. All indications, however, are in its favor. Try after 2014.",Elevation 1147 Estate,94,135.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,David Arthur
85479,US,"A brilliant Malbec, among the greatest ever produced in California. It's fat and opulent, shocking the palate with massive flavors of blackberries, blueberries, plums, cola, peppery spices and sweet, smoky sandalwood. Firm tannins hold everything in place, while the finish is thoroughly dry. Only 100 cases were produced, but it's worth a search.",Krupp Vineyard,94,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Malbec,Krutz
85480,US,"Very fine, very pure Syrah. Intense, well-structured, complex, a wine to lay down for a while, although it's delicious now.

Should glide smoothly through 2015.",Stagecoach Vineyard,94,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,Krutz
85481,France,"Still young, of course, but already the wine is showing great fruits, smoothed by wood, offering style and sophistication. As it opens up, the flavors of pears and sweet apples join the toast and the ripeness. This is on the path to greatness; give it 5–6 years and more.",Clos des Mouches Premier Cru,94,80.0,Burgundy,Beaune,,Chardonnay,Joseph Drouhin
85482,France,"Bouchard owns some fine parcels in Clos de Vougeot and this shows in the dense character of the wine, with its minerality and tight structure. It is dark, brooding almost, very dry, but likely to age well over many years.",,94,206.0,Burgundy,Clos de Vougeot,,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils
85483,France,"Rich, full, powerful Chardonnay, with yellow fruits balanced with lemon, green apple and white currants.

Age for 4–5 years and more.",Perrières Premier Cru,94,106.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Bouchard Père & Fils
85484,US,"Fruit and oak combine in this young, sensuous wine to make for immediate drinkability, but it's ageable. Floods the mouth with ripe, forward flavors of blackberry pie with the smoky-sweet crust, and there are notes of cola, black currant liqueur and Indian spices. This is a very fine, elegant Cabernet, with superfine tannins. It should age well throughout the decade.",InSpire,94,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Boyanci

Give the wine 4–5 years.",Les Clos Grand Cru,94,81.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils
85486,US,"Fans of the Northern Rhône might argue that this Syrah is too fruity, but there's no questioning its boldly Californian beauty. It thrills the palate with explosive blackberries, blueberries, cherries, currants, cocoa and spices, yet is balanced in refined tannins, and completely dry on the finish. In other words, superb.",Page-Nord Vineyard,94,29.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,Novy
85487,France,"Still young, this powerful wine has intense steely minerality to go with its almost stark green fruits. It has a great texture, edged with acidity, and a light toast character.

85489,US,"Dark as midnight on a moonless night,with an impenetrable, mysterious aroma, this wine is nowhere near ready to drink, but it shows considerable promise. Teases with flavors of blackberry tart, black currants, mocha and sweet violets, and chocaholics will appreciate the dark, slightly sweet chocolate notes. Dramatic and complex, this Syrah should develop through the next six years, at least.",,93,48.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Heintz
85490,France,"A full, concentrated wine, impressive for the vintage, offering solid structure, powerful tannins and ripe berry and red stone fruit flavors. It is very direct in style, the complexities slow to show themselves, just a hint as the wine opens up. It needs to age 5–6 years or more.",Rugiens Premier Cru,93,90.0,Burgundy,Pommard,,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils

The wine is beautifully integrated and harmonious and ends with impressive staying power and persistency.",Camarcanda,93,164.0,Tuscany,Bolgheri,,Red Blend,Ca' Marcanda
85492,France,"Plenty of ripe fruit and big texture on this intense wine, which hasn't shown half its potential yet. The pear and white peach fruits are edged with minerality and a closed-in texture. The wood gives an unfortunate burnt edge that needs to soften out. Age for at least five years.",Domaine du Pavillon,93,,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne,,Chardonnay,Albert Bichot
85493,US,"A super Chardonnay at a very reasonable price. The grapes come from two vineyards, Bien Nacido and Solomon Hills.

There's a minerality that adds structural integrity to the richness.",,93,25.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Alta Maria
85494,US,"Chards from this vineyard always show a typicity of intensely ripe citrus and tropical fruits, backed with bracing acidity and a stony minerality. This bottling threatens to go over the top in apricot sorbet that may have a touch of botrytis, but it wisely pulls back into balance at the last moment. Will gradually lose fruit over the next 10 years, becoming nuttier and drier.",Sleepy Hollow Vineyard,93,35.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Krutz

85496,Italy,"This expression of Chardonnay from Abruzzo in Central Italy delivers amazing intensity and opulence, but what sets this particular vintage apart is the purity of its aromas. The drying mineral note in particular appears vibrant and fresh and gives backbone to the whole wine. Long-lasting flavors of apricot, honey and almond cap the finish.",Marina Cvetic',93,60.0,Central Italy,Colline Teatine,,Chardonnay,Masciarelli
85497,US,"A fine, pure, fruity young wine. May be the one to drink while you're waiting for your other David Arthurs to age. Shows strong, ripe blackberry, currant, cherry, cola and cedar flavors, wrapped into exceptionally smooth tannins. Still, it should develop for a good eight years in a cool cellar.",Meritaggio,93,55.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,David Arthur
85498,US,"Rhône white blends are among the toughest to pull off in California, but Atmosphere does a terrific job. Among the top of its class, it's bone dry, crisp and minerally, with subtle, complex flavors of white peach, papaya, fig, vanilla and buttercream flavors. Really good.

85500,Argentina,"Begins in chunky, jammy fashion but soon it finds a classier groove.

Long on the finish, with the sum exceeding each part.",,90,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tempus Alba
85501,US,"This is a quite different mix than previous versions of the Bishop's Blend Red, and in my experience the best ever. Seductive and smoky, it grabs you from the get-go with aromas of sweet fruit and toasty barrel. It's full in front, smooth in the middle and soft in the finish. Just a hint of herb and leaf in the tannins, which may play out well with a few years of cellaring.",Bishop's Blend,90,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,William Church
85502,US,"The 2008 Muleskinner is toned down, perhaps from the cooler vintage. Though still plenty ripe and full throttle (almost 15% alcohol), it brings in nuances of herb and earth that add some depth and interest; the fruit flavors run to pomegranate and tart red berry. The new oak is again pulled back (to 40%), and adds just a hint of toast and coffee to the finish.",Muleskinner,90,50.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Spring Valley Vineyard

85504,Argentina,"Opens with heavy, gaseous aromas but once it settles down it shows much better. The palate is warm and chunky, with full berry flavors that come with a bit of earthy funk. Finishes lush and smooth, and while it's a fine Malbec, I found that it comes up short on expression.",Reserva,90,45.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alpamanta
85505,US,"Nicely balanced, with cedar, mint and cherry notes presented in a medium-bodied format. It's on the crisp side for Napa Cabernet, with red fruit and chocolaty oak combining on the slightly tart finish. Drink it over the next few years with steak and be happy.",Olema,90,20.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Amici
85506,Argentina,"Condensed and dark on the bouquet, with initial hard, cheesy aromas giving way to herbal berry scents that suggest thyme and rosemary. The palate is soft and chubby, with just enough structure to make the earthy, ripe berry flavors taste better than simply big and bulky. Finishes with a light espresso bitterness. Drink now through 2012.",Uno,90,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Antigal
85507,France,"With a wine from every cru in Chablis, La Chablisienne is able to bring out the character of each. This cool Côte de Léchet is typical in its tight, mineral character, revealing its edgy nature.

85509,US,"Tastes a bit candied and direct now in raspberry, cherry, vanilla and spice flavors, although it's dry, with fine, balancing acidity. Good, and rich and succulent, but needs time. Should develop bottle complexity over the next 4–6 years.",Clos Pepe Vineyard,90,50.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Ken Brown
85510,US,"Seems rushed to market. The wine is still rough, and tannic and acidic, with fresh raspberry and cherry fruit flavors overlaid with sweet oak. Quite good and distinguished, but if you buy it, stash it in the cellar until sometime in 2012 or even 2013.",Split Rock Vineyard,90,52.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bruliam
85511,US,"Delicious, offering an orchard of oranges and peaches, made even richer with honeysuckle, buttered toast and vanilla notes. Fine acidity makes the flavors bright and clean. The blend is 75% Viognier and 25% Marsanne.",,90,28.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Viognier-Marsanne,Calcareous
85512,US,"This is a powerful, gutsy Cabernet, currently lacking finesse. It's young, dry and brash, with sticky tannins and unmelded flavors and textures.

Seems best now and soon, although it could be a sleeper.",Sycamore Vineyard,90,70.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Freemark Abbey
85513,US,"A dusty, plummy, dark berry pie Petite Sirah from old vines grown in the Santa Clara Valley by the Guglielmo family, who have been based here since 1925.

85514,US,"Rich, round and fruity, this substantial Grenache demonstrates the potential for this grape in Washington. Though winter hardiness can be a problem, in years such as this, where it ripens perfectly, the vines deliver a juicy, full-bodied wine brimming with cherry and brambly berry flavors.

In the mouth, the wine shows an elegant, almost delicate side.",Jèma,90,49.0,Veneto,Veronese,,Corvina,Cesari
85516,US,"Not showing well in its youth. It's all sharp tannins and acids and blackberry-cherry jam fruit that smacks of immaturity.

85517,France,"Kirsch, black currant, cured meat and foliage notes lead the way on this concentrated, tightly structured wine.

85518,US,"A fine single-vineyard Syrah, aromatic with seductive scents of berry and earth, accented with toast and set up in the mouth with firm tannins.

Let it warm up in the glass.",Albutom,90,48.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Thomas Fogarty
85522,Argentina,"Very few Argentine wines feature quality Tempranillo blended with Malbec, but that's what B Crux does and it's a major reason why I like it so much. The 2006 vintage is deep, complete and smooth, with creamy, fresh berry and mild leather aromas in front of friendly, easygoing raspberry and blackberry flavors. The oak is prominent but doesn't overwhelm. Drinking nicely right now.",B Crux,90,21.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Red Blend,O. Fournier

85728,Spain,"Deep black fruit aromas make it inviting, while the palate is hefty and soft-edged, with creamy vanilla-infused plum and berry flavors.

85733,US,"This very dry Syrah has soft tannins and a full-bodied mouthfeel, with complicated flavors of baked cherries, cola, bacon and sandalwood.

85737,France,"Dominated by toasty, mentholly oak, this is a dark, vibrant purple-hued wine that features plenty of intensity, just not a lot of midpalate richness or complexity.

85743,US,"Kudos to Galante for crafting this distinctive blend of Malbec, Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's a dark, tannic, utterly dry wine that feels stylish in the mouth despite its considerable astringency. Maybe it's the depth of blackberry, currant, licorice, bacon, Mexican molé and sandalwood flavors that last so deep and long.

85747,Australia,"For the past several years, Duval's Plexus has been remarkably consistent in quality. The only indication here that 2008 was a difficult vintage (because of the heat) is this wine's creamy immediacy, which suggests early consumption (now–2015).

85775,France,"From Bouchard's own vineyards, this is a fine example of what is among the most renowned of Volnay's vineyards.

The feel is smooth and silky, with nice tannins and flavors of herbs, vanilla, cream, plum and chocolate. Lengthy on the finish, with acidic snap throughout.

85811,US,"A little heavy-handed, with chunky tannins, penetrating acidity and a powerful blast of jammy raspberry, cherry and blackberry fruit. Not particularly subtle, but dramatic, and while purists will find it oversized, it's a true expression of this central Santa Lucia Highlands vineyard.

85815,US,"Powerful scents of toast and buttered popcorn dominate the nose, but once in the mouth the wine shows some grip and depth.

Michelle
85816,US,"A big, extracted and, as currently constructed, somewhat ponderous wine that's not showing all that well. Could simply be immature, but it does seem to lack a certain vibrancy. Other than that, it's powerful in blackberry, black cherry and oak flavors, accompanied by strong tannins. Could surprise after, say, 2014.",Stone Place,89,90.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Crocker & Starr

85820,US,"An intense Cabernet, packed with concentrated mountain fruit flavors of blackberries, black cherries and cassis, and wrapped in hard, mouth-numbing tannins.

85825,US,"Smoky and toasty, with spicy blackberry and dark chocolate scents and flavors. The inviting nose leads into a moderately full-bodied wine with good persistence.

85838,US,"A wonderful red wine, full-bodied, dry and elegant. It shows Cabernet character in the blackberries, cherries and black currants, but that's balanced with an earthiness and minerality and even some smoked meat notes that must come from a percentage of Syrah and Petite Sirah.

The nose is deep, dense and black as night, with olive, tobacco, coconut and bold black fruit aromas.

85846,US,"Here's a Cabernet to age for a while. It's very dry and richly flavored in classic varietal flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar, with finely ground, intense tannins. But it has a youthful immaturity that simply isn't ready to appreciate now. Really needs time for all the parts to mesh together.

As 2009 was a warm year, the wine is thick as a brick, dark and seemingly soaked in oak. It's rich, with superconcentrated black-cherry and cassis flavors.

86070,US,"Heavy and densely tannic now, and not showing its best. It's an embryonic Cabernet that's all about potential. Analysis reveals deep, buried flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar that are impressively potent. Needs a bit of time to come around. Try in 2013.",Midoriya Hills Vineyard,92,55.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Prime
86071,US,"More tannicly dense than Failla's estate Sonoma Coast bottling, this Pinot wants a few years in the cellar. You can drink it now because it's so delicious in cherry and raspberry fruit, but there's a tightness, an astringency that suggests 3-4 years to come around. If you pop the cork now, give it a few hours of decanting.",Keefer Ranch,92,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
86072,Italy,"Here is an exceptionally fresh and pristine blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Bianco from a biodynamic vineyard in Tuscany with buoyant aromas of honeysuckle, stone fruit, apricot and white mineral.

86074,US,"What a gigantic improvement J. Lohr has been making lately in its Cabernets and Bordeaux blends.

86076,US,"The vintage was particularly successful for Patz & Hall, which achieved ripeness and balancing acidity with a seemingly effortless touch.

Grows better as it warms in the glass.",Zio Tony Ranch,92,60.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Patz & Hall
86077,US,"Easily the best Merlot from Livermore Valley in memory, which is not a back-handed compliment. It's a bone dry, tannic wine stuffed with complex, interesting fruit, currant, herb, tobacco and cedar flavors. Really very fine, and drinkable now despite the tannins. Its longterm future is controversial, though, so open over the next 3 years.",Estate,92,80.0,California,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Merlot,Picazo
86078,US,"Morgan makes one of the best, most powerful Santa Lucia Chardonnays, and this less expensive bottling is a good approximation of their top tier.

The grapes come from the Nielson Vineyard.",,92,26.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Byron
86081,Argentina,"There's no drop-off in this wine from the excellent 2005. Expect blackberry, cassis and dry balsam wood/cedar aromas. The palate is lush and chewy, but also vital and lively.

86086,US,"Soft and lush and delicious, with deep, intriguing flavors of red and black berries, cherries, currants, dark chocolate and smoky cedar.

86087,US,"This is a strong, oaky, ripe Chardonnay, grown on a mountain better known for Cabernet.

86088,US,"Here's a bold, rich, powerful Syrah, marked by huge fruit. Sometimes with these fruity wines, the winemaker loses control and produces a bomb. Not here.

86089,US,"This is a wine that's been tremendously variable over the years, but with the '07, Craig has produced his best bottling since the late 1990s.

Drink now and for the next few years.",Affinity,92,48.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Craig
86090,US,"An interesting Cabernet that shows how this venerable winery is taking the variety seriously.

Drink now.",Purisima Mountain Vineyard,92,48.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Grenache,Beckmen
86095,Argentina,"Among full-bodied, old-vines Malbec, this is an unbridled winner. The nose is rooty and sweet, but also inky and dark.

86096,France,"A solid wine, showing some generosity and richness, the fruits displaying a fine balance between sweetness, dry tannins and bright acidity.

Worth aging for several years, but already offering considerable pleasure.",Caillerets Premier Cru Ancienne Cuvée Carnot,92,89.0,Burgundy,Volnay,,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils
86097,US,"Based on Syrah, this is a distinguished, upscale blend. It's bone dry and quite tannic, with crisp Central Coast acidity, but most importantly it shows deep, intricate flavors of blackberries, currants, licorice, cola and sandalwood. A very fine release from Tolosa.",Salaal,92,42.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Red Blend,Tolosa

86104,Australia,"Yalumba's flagship Viognier is a broad, powerful wine, with pineapple and apricot flavors marked by hints of floral perfume and spice.

86105,Australia,"The White Mullet is an innovative blend of 70% Riesling, 11% Viognier, 10% Chenin Blanc and 9% Sauvignon Blanc.

86108,US,"Dark and dusty, this palate-coating wine shows well-managed tannins, smoothed just enough to unveil the strawberry, cherry and cassis fruit flavors.

86109,US,"Tight, sharp, and toasty, this thick and compact wine shows plenty of cherry fruit wrapped in chocolaty oak.

86114,US,"This Pinot, which was grown on the Hanzell estate, is described by the winery as a barrel selection made to drink now.

86118,US,"The grapes come from the estate vineyard in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The wine shows intense raspberry, cherry, persimmon and cola flavors, heightened by crisp, stimulating acidity.

86154,US,"Drier and more minerally than Foxen's other Chardonnays, because it is the least oaked.

86159,US,". Though it is five years old and just being released, this thick, tannic and rich Bordeaux blend still requires decanting, cellaring, and/or extensive breathing time. A full day after first being tasted, it came together for me; the initial, aggressively herbal character is equally matched to ripe black cherry fruit and massive tannins. The nose suggests sweet cherry, but the palate leans more to the herbal side, with flavors of earth, stem and leaf, and there is a green tea residual flavor that infuses the finish. A wine to cellar and to savor with a fine steak.",Red Wine,92,65.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Corliss Estates
86160,US,"There's a mushroom note to this Pinot that gives it an earthy richness, helping to ground the ripe, jammy raspberry and cherry flavors.

86167,US,"Every intervention available to the winemaker for creating richness has been applied here, including 75% new French oak. California Chardonnay hardly gets more extravagant in buttercream, smoky toast, lemon drop, apple butter and pear flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Grown in one of the coolest areas of the appellation, yet it's so rich and full bodied, it almost has the body of a red wine. Don't let it get too cold, and pay attention as it warms and evolves in the glass.",Charles Heintz Vineyard,92,65.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Moone-Tsai
86168,US,"This pretty wine is rich, dry and softly tannic.

86337,US,"This Bordeaux blend, made from the five classic varieties, is tough and resilient, compared to the standard Napa bottling. It's dry, tannic and herbal, yet with enough cherry-berry flavors to establish varietal character.

86340,Austria,"Flint and summer hedgerow perfumes give a great introduction to this tightly crisp wine. White nectarine juice shows a light richness. The wine has sliced apple acidity, juicy fruit, the freshest aftertaste. Screwcap.",Loibenberg,90,,Wachau,,,Riesling,Tegernseerhof
86341,Italy,"Tenimenti Ricci offers a dark and luscious wine with deep aromas of blackberry, cherry, exotic spice and old leather.

86344,US,"Drinking this new Ponzi reserve right after it's been released is not optimal; the supple and substantial fruit needs more time to meld with the barrel flavors.

86345,US,"Clearly well-origined, to judge from the fine structure and essential purity. But it's a very tannic, closed wine, with a mouth-numbing astringency that accentuates the acidity.

86346,US,"The sharp, unmistakable scent of new French oak barrels hits you immediately, and it plays nicely against this winery's naturally spicy, lightly resinous style of Pinot Noir. The elegant side of Oregon Pinot Noir is also on display, partly a virtue of the winery, partly a reflection of the vintage.

86352,Spain,"Tres Picos, or Three Peaks, ranks as a go-to wine for fans of round, smooth, slightly oaky reds. The bouquet is all mocha and smoky/oaky richness, while the sticky, rich palate deals blackberry and chewy, rooty medicinality. Oaky and spicy late, with licorice and warmth.

86393,Argentina,"This new wine from importer Bart Broadbent offers cherry, raspberry and plum aromas along with a touch of well-applied oak.

86720,US,"Give this young Cabernet a good decant before you serve, because it's a big, brooding wine that needs some air to open up.

87054,US,"Rogue Valley Cabernet Sauvignon has yet to carve out any sort of reputation for itself, and has been prone to herbaceous, even vegetal fruit with aggressively rough tannins. Winemaker Jonathan Oberlander has gone a ways toward taming them, rounding out the fruit, and crafting a complete and satisfying wine.

87239,Italy,"Wines from the Villero cru tend to show great elegance and complexity of aromas. This expression does just that and adds tones of spice, tar, black currant and cola along the way. The tannins are dry and dusty and the wine will age nicely for ten years or more.",Villero,91,50.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Giacomo Fenocchio
87240,Portugal,"This popular wine is about fresh fruit, vividly displayed with red cherries and red plum flavors, light tannins and easy acidity. To drink now.",Marquês de Borba,85,15.0,Alentejo,,,Portuguese Red,J. Portugal Ramos
87241,Greece,"Fresh lemon gives this wine lift, while oaky spice gives it curve. A balance of fresh and layered, the wine has a weight and spicy finish that gives it extra character. Pair with richer dishes or go simple and do sushi, salads.",Kapnias,85,28.0,Atalanti Valley,,,White Blend,Hatzi Michalis
87242,France,"Full bodied, but perhaps stretched a little beyond its limits, as the flavors of marmalade and honey seem to have difficulty covering the alcohol and bare stones. Drink up.",Domaine de la Becassonne,85,18.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône,,Rhône-style White Blend,André Brunel
87243,US,"Dry and tough in tannins, this Merlot is relieved with some good cherry, blackberry, cocoa, tobacco and oak flavors. The astringency doesn't seem likely to age out.",Reserve,85,46.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Merlot,Sunstone
87244,Spain,"Big boysenberry aromas are lively, a bit minty and fresh, while the extracted palate has a fruit-driven personality, ample tannins and dark wild-berry flavors. Young, bouncy and tangy on the finish. Composed for a young, inexpensive red.",,85,6.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,Tempranillo,Venta Morales
87245,Italy,"There are some tertiary aromas here of cola, Madeira, raisin and licorice that make you think the wine is older than it actually is. The mouthfeel is dense and rich but because the wine seems to be aging fast, don't wait long to drink it.",Carlin Burel,85,18.0,Piedmont,Dolcetto d'Alba,,Dolcetto,Rivetti Massimo
87246,Spain,"Opens with sweet berry and plum aromas and later there's earthy heft. The palate is big, acidic and fruity, with bold, stretched-out berry flavors. Finishes with a touch of bitterness and rubber, but overall it's a perfectly solid, grapey, tightly wound wine.",,85,10.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,Tempranillo,Rojo Mojo
87247,US,"Sharp and a bit volatile, this young Viognier tilts strongly to the orange side of citrus. Despite the fresh fruit flavors it feels a bit flat in the mouth, lacking vitality.",,85,18.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Southern Oregon,Viognier,Melrose
87248,US,"Super-fruity, offering a blast of blackberries, cherries, chocolate, persimmons, red plums and bacon, finished with enormous spices.

87250,Spain,"Decent and quaffable but does not compare to the winery's Verdejo. This is prickly and full of pine needle, juniper and other sharp aromas. The palate has a good feel but pickled, briney flavors. Skeletal given its warm-climate origins.",,85,11.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Sauvignon Blanc,Montespina

87252,Italy,"There's a touch of burnt matchstick at the very start of this wine, but it later opens to reveal citrus, stone fruit and white flowers. The mouthfeel is lean and tonic and this easygoing white blend from Tuscany would pair well with seafood or chicken salad.",Braviolo,85,,Tuscany,Toscana,,White Blend,Cantina del Cerro
87253,Portugal,"Spicy toast and wood aromas are the prelude to a wine that is extra soft, velvet almost, only hinting at tannins. The acidity is what gives structure to this wine, the berry and fig flavors rounding it out.",Sexy Tinto,85,13.0,Alentejano,,,Portuguese Red,Fitapreta Vinhos
87254,France,"Atypically dark in color, this brassy Châteauneuf blanc comes across as aromatically muted. Then it's very neutral in flavor, with ample breadth but lacking in richness and depth. It's something of a conundrum.",Les Cailloux,85,48.0,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,,Rhône-style White Blend,André Brunel

87257,US,"Pinot maestro Longoria continues to try his hand at Bordeaux blends despite the uphill challenge. This '07 is a Cab Franc-based bottling.

87264,US,"A hard, tannic wine, this shows concentrated raspberry fruit flavors, but does not have the fullness and texture of this winery's 2006 releases. Perhaps it's the vintage character, or maybe the wines were somehow stripped during vinification. Give it lots of aeration.",Olivia Vineyard,85,32.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Apolloni

Dense and layered, it immediately seduces for its softly lush flavors of blackberries, currants, anise, chocolate and sweet smoky oak. Yet it has the tannic complexity to age through 2013 at least. Made from 100% Cab, it's a blend of their best barrels from Diamond Mountain, Stags Leap and Sonoma Mountain.
