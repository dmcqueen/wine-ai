Drink over the next six years.",Papa's Knoll Estate,89,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Buehler
37498,US,"Sourced from old vines at Windrow and the less-well-known (but excellent) Tokar vineyard, this pure Cabernet Sauvignon shows a tight mix of plum, cassis, olive and earth, underscored by sharp acidity. It's young and substantial, with some heat in a finish marked by slightly bitter phenolics.",,89,42.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bunchgrass
37499,US,"An aromatic explosion with notes of white pepper, menthol, black cherry, and vanilla. It's medium bodied with citrusy acidity and firm tannins with oak notes fleshing out the finish. A delightful bottle that deserves a place at the dinner table.",Northridge Vineyard,89,36.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Mourvèdre,Bunnell Family Cellar
37500,Argentina,"A little bit hickory-dominated on the bouquet, but also giving balsamic notes, blackberry and chocolate mint. The palate is linear due to a streak of cutting acidity, while the palate is also snappy with wild raspberry and bright plum flavors and plenty of wood tannin. A toasty finish with espresso and chocolate is fine and long. Drink now through 2017.",Viña Cristina y Bibiana Coletto Single Vineyard,92,55.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trapiche
37501,Portugal,"A fascinating blend of five varieties, this solid, black wine shows structure, dense tannins, an enticing perfume and big, ripe fruits. The finish has acidity, but also those powerful tannins. Age for 4–5 years.",Rol de Coisas Antigas,92,30.0,Bairrada,,,Portuguese Red,Campolargo
37502,US,"The great '07s continue to roll out. Nearing four years of age, this Cabernet is quite soft, although it was probably soft to begin with. It's showing a few signs of age, with the rich, ripe, chocolaty flavors of blackberries, cherries and cassis beginning to dry out. Should continue to mellow in the bottle over the next six years.",,92,59.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Eponymous
37503,Italy,"Made with fruit from old vines, this is a rich and incredibly sophisticated expression of Soave Classico with wonderful density, intensity and lingering aromas of mature melon, stone fruit and almond. Its creamy richness persists on the palate.",Contrada Salvarenza Vecchie Vigne,92,35.0,Veneto,Soave Classico,,Garganega,Gini
37504,US,"A selection of prime, biodynamically farmed blocks from the estate vineyard, this Cowhorn reserve is elegant, detailed, rich and thoroughly captivating. Black cherry fruit is set in loamy earth flavors, soft and broadly displayed across the palate. Ripe without being in any way over the top, it brings in details of black tea, citrus, sandalwood and mocha. A complex wine of great finesse.",Reserve,92,45.0,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Southern Oregon,Syrah,Cowhorn
37505,US,"Ripe and powerful in blackberry, cherry, cassis and sweet oak flavors, with a spicy finish, this blend, which is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, also is potent in tannins.

Give it at least six years and try again.",JoLi Estate Vineyard,92,50.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Meritage,Clos La Chance
37506,South Africa,"Cocoa-dusted black cherry and berry aromas hit you first in the bouquet, followed by soft notes of black tea, violets and licorice shortly after.

Long finish with a peppery back note.",Z,92,35.0,Stellenbosch,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,De Toren
37507,France,"Chez Jaume, the family took the difficult decision not to produce its luxury Cuvée Origines in 2008. That old-vine juice ended up in this bottling, which no doubt accounts for its splendidly lush yet balanced midpalate and intense notes of cracked pepper, cassis and espresso. A great success for the vintage.",Domaine Grand Veneur,92,50.0,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Alain Jaume et Fils

37509,US,"Another small-production stunner from Terre Rouge, this Syrah is still young and tight but potentially potent. The wine opens with notes of white pepper and mushroom, dirt and earth, delving from there into herbs and plenty of berries. Very savory it will pair deliciously with Gruyère, bacon and mushroom, preferably all together in a quiche or tart.",Monarch Mine Vineyard,92,30.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Syrah,Terre Rouge
37510,US,"A beautiful Merlot, soft, elegant and classy. With richly textured tannins, it's ready to drink now, featuring raspberry, cherry, mocha and spice flavors. Alcohol is high, but balanced.",,92,42.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Arrowood

37517,US,"Strongly oaky at first sniff, this barrel-fermented reserve went through complete malolactic fermentation and a year and a half of barrel aging. The complexity comes out as it breathes open, a mélange of nuanced fruit including guava, peach, pineapple and green apple. Skin phenolics (from whole-cluster pressing) add some bite to the lengthy finish.",Reserve,92,30.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay,Ponzi
37518,Italy,"Past vintages of La Rocca have demonstrated Soave's potential for cellar aging, and this beautiful expression from the excellent 2009 vintage also shows a bright future ahead.

37519,US,"A flashy Cabernet, marked by its complex structure. Although fully dry, it has wildly ripe, sweet flavors of black cherries and cassis, accented with caramelized oak. At the age of nearly five, it seems best now and over the next four years for sheer vitality.",,92,60.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Raymond

37522,Portugal,"Want dense tannins? Then this your wine. Of course, it has much more than that. It has mineral-driven stone fruit flavors, a sense of terroir, of restrained power. It also has a serious side, and definite aging potential.",Escada,92,18.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,DFJ Vinhos
37523,US,"A beautifully rich, elaborate, almost sweet Cabernet, so ripe and delicious you can drink it now. Wrapped into soft, complex tannins, it shows tiers of blackberries, cassis, plums, minerals and spices, with a strong, cedary coating of oak that's in keeping with the size of the wine.",Estate Reserve,92,85.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Amizetta

37526,US,"A rich, spicy wine, marked by cinnamon and clove-accented raspberries, cherries, cola and mushrooms, as well as a bit of funk.

37529,US,"With appealing pineapple, orange, pear and green apple flavors enhanced with the vanilla and buttered toast of oak, this is a delicious Chardonnay. Its bright acidity makes it clean and mouthwatering. It's as good as the winery's more expensive Chards, making it a relative bargain. Production was 4,200 cases.",Estate,92,27.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse
37530,Croatia,"High-toned notes of bruised apples and fresh figs waft from this dry, medium-bodied Croatian Malvasia. Savory in profile, the palate is tinged with hints of tinned apple juice concentrate.",Malvoisie,82,16.0,Istria,,,Malvasia,Piquentum
37531,Georgia,"There are pleasant notes of ripe black cherry jam, spice and menthol on the nose and palate of this Georgian Saperavi, but obscured by a cloak of char, harsh tannins and a puckery acidity that lingers on the finish.",Marani Mukuzani,82,15.0,Kakheti,,,Saperavi,Telavi
37532,Montenegro,"Scents of ripe red fruit on the nose contrast with a slightly underripe, sour cherry palate on this red wine from Montenegro. Despite its sharp acidity and a coarse mouthful of tannins, it ends on a pleasant chocolate-cherry finish.",,82,10.0,Lake Skadar Valley,,,Vranec,Monte Cheval
37533,Spain,"Oily and frankly a bit skunky on the nose. The palate is spritzed yet soft, with chunky, blowsy, generic white fruit flavors. Doesn't inspire; this winery's red wines are better.",Abadal,82,21.0,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,,Picapoll,Masies d'Avinyo

37536,Croatia,"There's a distinct grassy note of hay and alfalfa on the nose of this Croatian red wine. On the palate, there are pleasant notes of ripe red fruit and chocolate, but coarse grape tannins and a bold 15.5% alcohol content contribute to a rather harsh, disjointed mouthfeel.",Dingač,82,65.0,Middle and South Dalmatia,,,Plavac Mali,Saints Hills

37548,Spain,"Mild lime and mineral aromas draw interest, but the wine's palate is medium spritzy and sour, with sharp, lemony flavors and a dilute feel.

37555,Argentina,"Gold in color and about as overoaked as a white wine can be. This blend of Viognier, Chardonnay and Riesling is all resin and barrel spice.

37558,Spain,"Tan like cream soda, with a weird, faded bouquet of banana pudding and resiny oak. Soft and weakly structured except for lasting acidity, while it tastes like fermented apples and finishes on bitter walnut.

37561,Italy,"Cecchi, the historic estate in Chianti Classico, is doing beautiful work at their second property in Maremma, southern Tuscany.

37565,US,"Doesn't say so on the label, but it's Cabernet Sauvignon. However it's utterly unlike most other Napa Cabs in the dryness and tartness.

37566,US,"This is a good, dry Chardonnay, marked by brisk acidity and a steely minerality. The fruit veers toward pineapples and apricots, while oak adds notes of buttered toast and caramel.

37567,Italy,"You'll really love this simple and clean white wine from sunny Tuscany. The aromas here are crisp and fragrant, recalling peach, apricot and pear.

37569,Spain,"Like most base-level Garnachas, this one has a sweet, candied aromatic cover. But unlike many it has depth, purity and avoids boring, offensive sweetness.

37570,US,"Even for a Mount Veeder Cab, this one's pretty tannic. It also seems very oaky, with lots of caramelized, charred wood.

37572,US,"The LUX bottling has a bit more concentration than the other estate-grown Pinot Noir from Luminous Hills.

It's an impressive wine, with a thick and determined style.",Terra di Monteverro,91,75.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Monteverro
37857,US,"A blend of 81% Merlot, 12% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot. An unusually tight Pedestal, this absolutely must be decanted. It opens well, with black fruits, toasted grain, and firm tannins, then hits a wall and stops short. However, with a lot of breathing time and/or aerating, it broadens out a bit and shows more length and finesse.",,91,55.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Pedestal
37858,US,"A delicious Sauvignon Blanc, barrel fermented in some new oak. It's elaborate in kiwi, orange, pear and honeydew melon flavors, yet crisp acidity and a firm minerality provide balance. Drinks better at room temperature, like a red wine.",,91,30.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Merry Edwards
37859,US,"Intensely ripe, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit marks this impressive young Pinot Noir. It shows Williams Selyem's impeccable balance and elegance, but is a little soft and direct, lacking nuance. Could do interesting things in the bottle down the years, but seems best now and through 2014.",Olivet Lane Vineyard,91,75.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
37860,US,"With zesty acidity, this is a bright, lively Chardonnay. It's very rich, offering waves of orange, green apple, pear and tropical fruit flavors, made firm with minerals. Drink this flashy Chardonnay over the next three years.",Native Yeast,92,48.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse
37861,US,"Always an underestimated wine, this 2007 from Hess Collection is a beautiful Cabernet. It's dry and balanced, and the blackberry and currant flavors have a pleasing earthiness. That old cliché, “food friendly,” definitely applies. Drink it now and over the next six years.",,92,48.0,California,Mount Veeder,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hess Collection
37862,US,"Strikes a nice balance between fat, rich, decadently ripe raspberry and date fruit, with a drink-me-now appeal, and a more serious undertow of tannins, mushrooms and pine. Give it a good decant, and focus on what's going on in the glass.",Zeigler Vineyard,92,28.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
37863,Portugal,"Mining a rich vein of sweet black plum fruits, this is big and powerful while held together with firm tannins, very ripe fruit, a smoky wood character and a ripe, juicy finish. Age for 4–5 years.",Quinta de Cabriz Four C,92,80.0,Dão,,,Portuguese Red,Dão Sul
37864,US,"Very limited, this is a relatively new project from second generation winemaker Jason Lett. It is sourced from “the oldest vines in the Willamette Valley”—presumably Eyrie vines planted in 1965, and finds similar territory as the Eyrie reserve, with a bit more richness through the midpalate, partly from more expressive barrel flavors.",,92,63.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay,BlackCap
37865,US,"This Cabernet comes from the Soda Canyon region of Napa Valley, which is a cool area in the Vaca Mountains, northeast of the city of Napa that is not an official appellation. The wine shows excellent structure, with firm tannins and a bite of acidity, and is very dry. The pure Cabernet flavors are of blackberries, cherries, cassis and green olives, with a kiss of oak. Seems like a wine to put away in the cellar.",Coliseum Block,92,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Carter
37866,US,"A beautiful Merlot that shows how well this variety grows in a great vineyard on the Napa side of the Carneros appellation. It's rich and complex in cherry, spice and oak flavors, with an umami taste of cured meat, and the tannins are rich and firm. The wine shows the crisp, mouthwatering acidity of Carneros, especially in this cool vintage. Drink now–2013 for freshness.",Truchard Vineyard,92,65.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Merlot,Carter
37867,US,"A wonderful, amazingly rewarding wine, certainly one of California's best Albariños. If there's any oak at all, it's insignificant. What stars is brilliant Edna Valley acidity and racy flavors of citrus fruits, pears, white flowers and white peppery spices. The perfect cocktail wine.",Paragon Vineyard,92,17.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Albariño,Tangent
37868,US,"An elegant, compelling Chardonnay, its fruit accented with lemon, honey and lime. Low cropping of Dijon clone 76 has concentrated the flavors (and the alcohol—a surprising 15.7%) without turning the wine into an overblown fat boy. Nuanced and long, it is one of the most satisfying Chardonnays to come out of Oregon in recent memory.",Crawford Beck Vineyard,92,24.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay,Seven of Hearts
37869,France,"Not a typical Crozes-Hermitage, Jaboulet's Domaine de Roure is a showcase for what the appellation is capable of.

37872,US,"A block selection from the estate, this is an intense, flattering Chardonnay.

Brisk acidity brings welcome balance to the richness.",M,91,48.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse
37873,US,"Nearly five years of age, and giving its best. Slowly losing berry fruit, it's turning dry and mushroomy.

37874,US,"Dark, spicy and deeply flavored, this Cabernet is dense and concentrated in blackberry and cassis flavors, with a stony minerality at its core. The fruit is so ripely expansive, it tastes sweet on the finish, yet the wine is utterly dry. It's good now despite the hard mountain tannins, but should begin to blossom after 2014.",Bismark Mountain Vineyard,91,54.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hanna

37877,US,"Very similar to the 2006, Kameron's '07 Bordeaux blend, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is upfront in blackberry, cherry, cassis, oak and spice flavors. It's quite tannic, with a puckery astringency that suggests needed time in the cellar. Better after 2014.",Cuvée Kristin Estate Blend,91,55.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Korbin Kameron
37878,US,"An enormous Cabernet. Explodes with flavors of blackberries, cassis and chocolate, as well as the sweet vanilla and toast from oak barrels. It's gentle enough to drink now, but isn't showing much nuance. Give it five  or six years in the cellar.",Veraison Stagecoach Vineyard,91,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Krupp Brothers

Worth aging another year to bring its great flavors together.",Casa de Santar Condessa de Santar,91,35.0,Dão,,,Portuguese White,Dão Sul
37881,Argentina,"Deep and lush, with aromas of blackberry, cassis and coffee. This is actually a better, more balanced wine than the winery's Gran Misterio because it isn't over the top and overoaked. Flavors of mocha, coffee and mulled berry are on the money, while the chocolaty finish is smooth. Drink now due to low acidity.",Misterio,91,35.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Alma Negra

37887,US,"Lots of zippy acidity in this fresh, dry, clean Sauvignon Blanc. It's unoaked, which allows the Meyer lemon, orange and guava fruit to star.

37888,US,"Another successful Tannat from Cambiata, the fourth vintage in a row to score at least 90 points. The grape variety, from southwest France, produces a dry, tannic, full-bodied wine like this one. It has a stringy feel, with deep flavors of raspberries. Will age for a very long time.

37894,Portugal,"This rich and fruity wine shows the natural richness of the Douro, with dense and firm tannins that will allow the wine to age.

37896,Chile,"Deep, alluring aromas of blackberry and cassis are youthful and thus a bit animal and wild. In the mouth, this young CS is chunky, rubbery and dense. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and black coffee are on the dark side, while the finish offers a meaty, substantive feel, tons of lasting fruit flavor, and a touch of heat and burn that will fade away with more time in bottle.

37906,Chile,"Cola, spice, wild berry, herb and graphite aromas are powerful and raring to go. This feels racy, juicy and tangy, with a mix of oak, herb, tomato, leather and savory berry flavors.

The palate has a hard intensity to it that I haven't seen before from this wine, with bitterness along with black cherry, chocolate and toasty flavors.

38035,France,"In the past, there was much more red wine than white wine produced in Chassagne-Montrachet. This firm, tannic wine, with its austere fruit, shows a similarity to Pommard.

38122,US,"This feels over-cropped, dilute, with more than a little tomato leaf and vegetable among its rather delicate scents and flavors.

38130,US,"This interesting Cabernet was grown in various parts of the valley, but you can detect a cool-climate influence in the acidity and especially the tannins, which are firm and astringent.

38293,Chile,"Pinched on the nose but solid in terms of aromas: blackberry, cassis and a touch of oak come together well.

Toast and mint come up on the finish.",Natura,86,11.0,Central Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Emiliana

Drink up.",Starr Ridge Vineyard,86,50.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell

38304,Chile,"For simple SB, this is a good value with legitimate aromas of lime, green apple and mineral.

About as honest as you'll get in under-$10 Sauvignon Blanc.",Xplorador,86,8.0,Central Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Concha y Toro

38320,Portugal,"While this is aged in barrel, the wood influence doesn't quite work for Arinto, which is a lively, fruity varietal.

It's a big wine whose fruits and tannins suggest pairing with smoky barbecue.",Montecillo Vineyard,90,28.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Keating
38749,US,"Elegance marks this wine, grown on the cool-climate Laetitia estate, so close to the Pacific along the Central Coast. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with a minerally tow to the pineapple and lime flavors. Oak is evident, but the underlying wine is the star.",Estate,90,18.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Blanc,Laetitia
38750,US,"There's no oak on this wine, which lets the fruit star. It does a bravura performance, with turns of pineapples, limes, gooseberries and tart mandarin oranges that finish in a swirl of spices. Acidity adds a brilliant zestiness, and even though the alcohol is only 12.9% by volume, the wine is thoroughly dry.",,90,19.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Long Meadow Ranch
38751,US,"Although this wine is very dry and tannic, it has a compelling elegance that makes it fascinating and worthy of pairing with good food. With berry, tobacco, beef jerky and cola flavors, it's a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Merlot and Petite Sirah. Drink now.",Table 5,90,38.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,MC Wines
38752,US,"From the oldest block of the estate vineyard, this fruit-driven Pinot is crisp and lively, mixing bright berry flavors with just a hint of sandalwood. Tannins are tamed, and the emphasis is clearly on purity of fruit.",10 Acre,90,48.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Patton Valley
38753,US,"This wine earns its high score by virtue of sheer richness. It's enormous in blackberry, cassis, roasted meat, licorice, black pepper and smoky cedar flavors, and finishes dry and spicy. There's a tannic toughness that resists the palate, and doesn't seem likely to age out, so drink over the next few years.",,90,60.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Pride Mountain
38754,US,"Made in a lighter style, but showing true Williams Selyem elegance and complexity. With pretty cherry, cola, spice and sandalwood flavors, it has bright acidity, and is a very nice Pinot Noir to drink now.",,90,37.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
38755,US,"Blended from four estate vineyards, this new release actually trumps the much-lauded 2008. Aromatics are lovely, a beguiling mix of rose petals, raspberries, earth and herb. The wine has finesse, fine acidity, tension and length. Fine for drinking now, but cellarable for the next decade.",,90,30.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,The Eyrie Vineyards
38756,US,"Four vineyards provided the fruit, one third of which was fermented in whole clusters, creating a round, full-bodied wine with lush cherry fruit, streaked with vanilla. Nice spice notes from barrel aging, and a pleasing earthy character underscores the tannins.",Special Reserve,90,42.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Seven of Hearts
38757,Portugal,"Deliciously perfumed wine that revels in its cool-climate structure and freshness. Black currant fruits and soft tannins follow through with some dryness. A fine, food-friendly wine.",Quinta do Sanguinhal,90,30.0,Obidos,,,Portuguese Red,Sanguinhal

38759,Portugal,"Powerful, complex wine, its tannins beautifully integrated into the dense structure and full black berry fruits. It is so well balanced, the acidity showing seamlessly on finish.",Reserva,90,,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Tedo
38760,Spain,"Grapey and potent as Rioja crianzas go, with a medium-to-full-sized palate that's full of bright acidity and standard but solid berry fruit flavors. It's the slightest bit creamy and thick on the finish, but overall it's about as middle of the road as any wine on the market.",Crianza,86,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Finca Nueva
38761,US,"Young vines, the first release from estate-grown fruit. The vanilla flavors of the barrels are front and center at the moment, though there are darker fruits in the background, along with smoke, licorice and a hint of tar. Good long-term potential.",,86,34.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Southern Oregon,Petite Sirah,Folin Cellars
38762,US,"Dry and rather scoury, with a rough mouthfeel. But it's clean and bone dry, and shows proper sparkling wine flavors of citrus, vanilla, yeast and green apple.",Sofia Blanc de Blancs,86,19.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Sparkling Blend,Francis Coppola

38764,US,"Dry and zesty in mouthwatering acidity, this clean wine features upfront flavors of lemons, limes, grapefruits and oranges. It's a nice cocktail sipper at a good price.",The Birdman,86,12.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Pinot Grigio,Big House
38765,France,"At three years old, this wine is showing some interesting developed aromas of almond paste and petrol while the lightweight palate displays some nice butter tones. Pick this one up soon, for it seems to be fading.",,86,17.0,Provence,Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence,,White Blend,Le Classique from the 3 Springs Vineyard
38766,Spain,"Very light in body, color and aromas. The nose is punchy and a bit sharp, and so is the palate, which offers crisp, bracing acids to highlight zesty, lean nectarine and tangerine flavors. Quite linear and citric, but experience with this wine says it shows best with food.",,86,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Rosé,Muga
38767,US,"Smells and tastes overoaked, with toothpicky vanilla and smoky char notes. The amount of new French wood was 50%. The jammy raspberry, cherry and currant fruit just isn't intense or complex enough to support all that weight. Drink now.",Durell Vineyard,86,44.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pali
38768,Spain,"Soda pop-like on the nose, with a clear reference to Sprite and 7Up. The palate is somewhat candied and simple, but it has good feel and the flavors of lemon-lime are likable. Mild on the finish, with flavors that extend from the lemon-lime bouquet and palate.",Brut,86,14.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Mistinguett
38769,US,"Notable for its dryness, crispness of acidity and the brightness of the citrus fruit and honeysuckle flavors. Could be Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio, but whatever, it's a very nice, clean white wine.",Randle Hill Vineyard,86,20.0,California,Yorkville Highlands,North Coast,Sémillon,Yorkville Cellars
38770,US,"Lots to like in this creative blend of Vermentino, Verdelho, Viognier and Sauvignon Blanc. It's well acidified, with citrus, orange blossom, peach, apricot, buttercream and mineral flavors. Just a bit too sweet, though, with a sugary taste throughout.",White4 Huerhuero,86,16.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,White Blend,Vina Robles
38771,US,"Off-dry with a candied orange character, this is indeed a mélange, including portions of seven different white wine grapes. It's an interesting wine, though might prove a bit challenging to match to food. Perhaps a curry?",Mélange Blanc,86,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,White Blend,Waterbrook
38772,US,"A super-fruity, direct Pinot, rather one-dimensional in cherry, raspberry and mocha flavors. Dry and crisp, with a silky texture, it's a good wine to drink now.",Appellations Series,86,30.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Cru
38773,Spain,"A chunky wine with compost, coffee and leather on the nose. The palate holds onto that chunkiness with clumsy flatness that goes with herbal plum and berry flavors. Airing allows it to unfold and find a better place, but always does it seem heavy and on the murky side.",Lealtanza Selección Especial Reserva,86,36.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Altanza
38774,US,"Nicely dry, acidic and minerally, with tart Meyer lemon, lime and pink grapefruit flavors. Suffers a bit from some green unripeness that suggests vegetable. Not too much, though, and pretty good for the price.",Reserve,86,18.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Concannon
38775,Spain,"The opening of smoke, rubber and black cherry comes across as being dark and good. The palate holds form with lively cherry, plum and currant flavors and finally a medium-long, somewhat warm and meaty finish. Good for an everyday, no-frills Garnacha.",Viña Alarba Old Vines,86,10.0,Northern Spain,Calatayud,,Grenache,Bodegas y Vinedos del Jalón
38776,US,"Melon and jasmine aromas abound in this light, refreshing Riesling offering glimpses of white peach, lime and slate on the palate. A hint of bitter almond adds complexity to the finish.",Dry,86,13.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Lamoreaux Landing

38778,Italy,"There's a brambly, slightly unripe or green aroma that characterizes this vintage of Poggio Antico's popular Rosso di Montalcino. That said, the wine does fill in smoothly over the palate with wild berry and spice flavors.",,86,48.0,Tuscany,Rosso di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Poggio Antico
38779,Spain,"Starts out muddled and murky, and eventually settles on rich, raisiny and slightly stewed. Seeing that this is Toro, some overripeness is almost a given, and thus the black fruit and licorice flavors are expected. Finishes warm, toasty and short, with a candied hollowness.",Crianza,86,22.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tempranillo,Tardencuba
38780,US,"Bone dry, wonderfully fresh and loaded with strawberry and watermelon flavors, hepped up with lightly peppery spice.

38781,US,"This is a jammy wine with raspberry and currant flavors, accented with pepper, anise and cocoa, with a coating of sweet oak. It's fundamentally dry, and a little simple in structure. Good now with grilled steak and chimichurri sauce.",,86,38.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Wild Oak by St. Francis
38782,Spain,"Piercing to start, with leathery, bacony and campfire aromas. Saturated, although healthy, if a bit hard and tannic. Flavors of bacon and clove are right up there with black fruit and syupy richness, and clove carries onto the finish. Needs time to breathe and unfold; 65% Garnacha and 35% Syrah.",Tinto Joven,86,17.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Garnacha-Syrah,Pagos del Moncayo
38783,US,"Way too oaky. Like drinking toothpicks, with its charred, wood flavors and oak tannins. The wine is dry and the underlying blackberry and cherry sour candy fruit is just fine, but the oak dominance makes you wonder if the wine will ever age.",Franklin Vineyard,86,75.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rutherford Ranch
38784,Australia,"A decent introduction to Australian Grenache, a bit simple and one-dimensionally cherry-fruited but clean, supple and easy to drink despite plenty of body, with just a bit of warmth on the finish. Drink now.",Bitch,86,12.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Grenache,R Wines
38785,US,"Bright with fresh apple and pear aromas, this off-dry style Riesling is a sunny, cheerful wine that melds the sweetness of tangerines with a high-toned acidity.",,86,16.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Billsboro
38786,US,"The winery mentions neutral oak barrels, though the immediate aromatic impression is still on the toasty/oaky side. The fruit comes up more slowly, along with residual CO2 that gives a spritzy mouthfeel. Yeasty, light and tart, with green apples the strongest fruit flavor.",,86,22.0,Oregon,Columbia Valley (OR),Oregon Other,Chardonnay,Cathedral Ridge
38787,US,"With a green grassiness that justifies the vineyard's name, this is a New Zealand-style wine. It's bone dry and zesty in acidity, with citrus, hay and gooseberry flavors, and more than a little feline spray you'll either love or hate.",Mesa Verde Vineyard,86,22.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Brander
38788,US,"A bit jammy and simple, with fresh, primary flavors of blackberries and cherries that are almost sweet. Oak adds creamy, smoky notes. Drink now.",,86,48.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,C. Beck
38789,Spain,"Opens with bright, popping cherry aromas that are straightforward, much like the rest of the show. The palate is regular and healthy in feel, with standard cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes the slightest bit toasty and warm. Nice but basic Rioja.",Viña Zaco,86,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Bilbainas
38790,US,"A little aggressive in feline spray notes, but pulls back just in time to let the gooseberry, grapefruit, lemon and lime flavors star. Crisp acidity provides fortunate balance to this sweetly fruit wine.",,86,20.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Mario Bazán
38791,US,"Tasted in the late summer of 2010, this Cab was pretty tannic and acidic, despite some very rich and dynamic blackberry, black cherry, currant and licorice flavors. It will hit its peak sometime in the next 2–3 years.",Best Barrel,86,40.0,California,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Municipal Winemakers
38792,US,"A little simple and soft, but a pretty good approximation of Russian River Valley Pinot Noir. Shows raspberry jam, cola, red licorice and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into a silky texture.",,86,17.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sea Mist
38793,US,"A good Pinot Noir for everyday drinking. It's very dry and crisp and silky in the mouth, with complex flavors of cherries, cola, licorice and beef jerky. The acidity suggests rich, oily fare, like lamb or salmon.",,86,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Pinot Noir,Simple Math Cellars
38794,Chile,"A good, basic table wine with spice, berry syrup, flower notes and char on the nose. The palate is a bit sharp and tangy, but the herbal berry and pepper flavors are pleasing. Shows a clean outlook and a dry coffee-tinged finish.",Private Reserve,86,13.0,Maule Valley,,,Carmenère,Viña el Aromo
38795,Australia,"Fresh and juicy, this easy-drinking blend provides simple mint and cassis aromas and flavors at a reasonable price, with just enough structure to stand up to burgers and the like.

38797,US,"This wine comes from the San Lucas area of the southern Salinas Valley, on the way toward Paso Robles. It's a peppery wine, rustic, hot and dry, with strong jammy flavors of cherries and blackberries, and a long, spicy finish. Drink now.",,86,42.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Syrah,Pomar Junction

38799,Chile,"Dark, earthy and rubbery aromas go along with a reasonably fruity bouquet, and as a whole the entry is good. The palate is full, a bit rough and rugged, with ripe, sweet black-cherry and cassis flavors. Concentrated and a touch syrupy, but good for what amounts to basic Cabernet.",Estate,86,12.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Errazuriz
38800,France,"This is a soft, open wine, full of ripe berry fruits and red cherries. There is only the lightest tannin, along with bright acidity, a wine that is so ready to drink.",Sélection,86,,Beaujolais,Brouilly,,Gamay,Georges Duboeuf
38801,US,"Hard to appreciate, with its bite of acidity and jammy flavors. Good and dry, but this Cabernet lacks the richness and complexity you expect from Oakville.",,86,55.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Groth
38802,France,"With tight acidity and a grassy herbaceous character, the wine has crisp fruit, a flinty structure and a brittle apple-skin texture. For fresh apéritif drinking.",,86,17.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Blanc,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château La Rame
38803,Australia,"A bold, aggressive wine that lacks a bit of elegance, the 2008 Galvo Garage is a big mouthful of cassis and cedar. In another few years it may settle down, but for now the overall impression is of a rather rough customer that's best suited to be poured alongside grilled steak.",The Galvo Garage Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot-Cabernet Franc-Petit Verdot,86,29.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale-Adelaide Hills,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,D'Arenberg
38804,France,"Fixin, the northernmost red wines on the Côte de Nuits, generally produces light wines. This is no exception; the wine is bright, very fresh, with hints of berry fruits.",Vieilles Vignes,86,36.0,Burgundy,Fixin,,Pinot Noir,Derey Frères
38805,US,"Soft in the mouth, with a somewhat simple structure, this Syrah's main virtue is flavor. It's enormously rich in ripe blackberry- and cherry-pie filling, cola, licorice, mint, chocolate, bacon and pepper flavors, and is fully dry.",Canterbury Vineyard,86,26.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Syrah,Bell
38806,Argentina,"The opening of lemon, lychee and pineapple is textbook and clean, while the palate is full and oily but not cloying or bitter. In fact, the flavors are pure applesauce and green melon, while the finish is fat and generous. A respectable, honest take on Torrontés.",Desvario,86,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Bodega Tierra Colorada
38807,France,"Fresh fruit shows the acidity of the year, while the black currant flavors give great freshness. The aftertaste is soft, flavored with strawberry juice.",Beaune du Château Premier Cru,86,40.0,Burgundy,Beaune,,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils

38809,Italy,"Nivole, a play on the Italian word for clouds, is a fresh and floral Moscato d'Asti with foamy bubbling and delicate aromas of soapy flowers, honey and sweet peach. Although this wine should normally be consumed very young, this vintage has held up beautifully and there's a touch of creamy mint on the close.",Nivole 375ml,86,,Piedmont,Moscato d'Asti,,Moscato,Michele Chiarlo

38814,Chile,"Creamy and herbal on the nose, with mild vegetal aromas and big but bland black-fruit scents. The palate is big and chunky, with heavy berry flavors tempered by herbal notes. Same goes for the finish, which is thick and hefty but a little sticky.",Ecos de Rulo,86,,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Viña Bisquertt
38815,Argentina,"Despite being six years old, this is still kicking. The nose is raw and stewy, but it's also ripe and rubbery, with cassis and berry aromas. The palate is thick, bulky and chunky, with heavy, chewy berry fruit flavors in front of a slightly baked finish. One-dimensional but not bad for Argentine Cab.",Limited Reserve,86,24.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Viña El Cerno

38819,South Africa,"Surprisingly, this blend of 65% Chenin Blanc and 35% Sémillon is quite rich and oaky with prominent aromas of butter, wood-grilled red apple and walnut skin. The mouth offers more creamy nutty flavors of buttered popcorn and peach pit, but a bit lacking in the fruit department.",Donatus White,86,25.0,Stellenbosch,,,White Blend,Dornier
38820,Germany,"There's a revitalizing swathe of herbs on the nose of this medium-sweet Riesling, highlighting notes of lemon and lime against a backdrop of juicy, ripe yellow peaches and nectarines.

38821,Germany,"While intensely youthful on the nose with aromas of fresh red cherries and blossom, the wine seems to build in depth and maturity on the palate. Fresh red fruit turns deeper and darker, and pretty floral notes pick up hints of potpourri and fall foliage. Elegant yet seductive, it is delicious now, but should mature beautifully through 2019–2021.",Trocken,91,20.0,Rheinhessen,,,Spätburgunder,Thörle
38822,Germany,"Touches of candlewax and savory herbs add intrigue and complexity to bright, sunny peach and apricot flavors in this semi-sweet wine.

38823,US,"Distinctive aromatic qualities mark this afforable bottling, an exclusive for Hawaiian supermarket chain Foodland from the team at Terravant Wine Company in Buellton.

38824,France,"While still young, this wine has a smooth texture that shows the black fruits and perfumed tannins well. The balance of acidity and rich fruitiness is underpinned by the drier, tannic core.

38825,France,"Rife with aromas of spring flowers, this wine is crisp, full of tight acidity and has a lively, bright texture.

39274,Chile,"The nose on this blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère is herbal and a touch mulchy, with berry, coffee and olive aromas. The palate feels thick and on the cusp of syrupy, with baked, creamy black-fruit flavors that bring carob, chocolate and herbs accents to a modest finish.

39275,US,"The Acrobat bottling is one of Oregon's best sub-$20 Pinot Noirs, and a fine example of what might be called “new wave” styling.

39276,US,"This is one of Lynmar's most expensive Chardonnays, of their six 2011s. It's also one of the most forward and oakiest. Your first impression is of sweet buttered toast, sprinkled with brown sugar and drizzled with melted butterscotch. Then the tropical fruits kick in, brightened with citrusy acids. It's an impressive feat, but the wine feels overworked, and lacks the sustaining interest of Lynmar's other bottlings.",Monastery,88,70.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar

39279,US,"A solid Cabernet from this hot appellation, located well inland in Sonoma County. The wine is dry, tannic and fairly high in alcohol, although it wears its heat well.

39459,France,"A Gentil is a blended wine, and this wine brings together Gewürztraminer, Pinot Gris, Riesling, Sylvaner and Pinot Blanc.

39461,Chile,"Minty spice and vanilla are the lead aromas on this heavily oaked Merlot. There's also raw wood grain and clove to the nose.

40183,Spain,"Leathery, stalky berry aromas are a bit rustic, and so is the feel. But the flavors on this Cabernet from Cariñena are satisfying and forward, suggesting stewed plum, baked berry and sun-drenched warmth. This is almost cooked but it pulls back.

40197,US,"Was it the chilly vintage that made this wine so elusive? Tasted in the spring, it was oaky and jammy with raspberries and cherries, with the astringent tannins of green herb tea.

The richness of this wine, and its overall intensity, would match hearty game meat dishes.",Maronea,89,,Tuscany,Bolgheri,,Red Blend,Casa di Terra
40279,France,"At this stage, a wine that is dominated by wood. The weight and the ripe fruit are there as well to suggest potential dark fruits, black plums, damsons and a juicy character.

42385,US,"Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this mountain-grown wine, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon but contains the other four classic Bordeaux varieties. Although it's very tannic, those tannins are remarkably soft.

42656,Germany,"A whiff of orange blossoms accents bright Meyer lemon and quince flavors on this zesty, invigorating wine. Off-dry in style, it's unabashedly fruity yet wraps up elegantly with a murmur of lime-skin astringency.",Graach Josephshöfer GL Kabinett,89,31.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt
42657,Germany,"Whiffs of lemon and lime are subtly aromatic on this dry, full-bodied wine. The palate is bright and fresh with pear and apple flavors, but elevated by a penetrating sheen of minerality that lingers through the finish.",Schwarzer Adler,89,25.0,Baden,,,Pinot Gris,Franz Keller
42658,Germany,"Streaks of wax and lanolin meld into tart pineapple and white peach notes in this dry, elegantly mineral Pinot Gris. The palate balances juicy, fresh fruit with a steely, focused acidity that's refreshing and invigorating.",Estate Bottled,89,17.0,Baden,,,Pinot Gris,Oberbergen
42659,US,"No grape seems too obscure for Kenneth Volk, not even the Portuguese varietal Verdelho. Only 92 acres are planted in all of California, including the ones Volk himself planted in Paso Robles in 1994. Aromas of red apple and pear slowly draw you in, not spilling all the goods on the nose. The flavors are relatively slight on the tongue, with nectarine, honeyed nuts and baked apple. The tight acidity makes it a great pairing for Thai and Vietnamese dishes.",Pomar Junction Vineyard,89,24.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Verdelho,Kenneth Volk
42660,US,"Amazingly rich and ripe, defining the Bien Nacido cool-climate style. The grapes hung for a long time in this excellent vintage, getting ripe and balanced, and the wine offers dazzling opulence, while preserving vital acidity. Showcases dessert pastry flavors of pineapples, mangoes, buttered toast, buttercream, meringue and honeysuckle, accented with dusty spices. Simply beautiful from first sniff to the last swallow.",Santa Barbara Historic Vineyards Collection Bien Nacido Vineyard,95,30.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Au Bon Climat
42661,US,"Made from 100% Sauvignon Blanc, with a great many vines more than 50 years old, this is an enormously complex wine. Fruit doesn't dominate. Flowers and minerals do, with flavors of stones, herbs and earth. What fruit there is brings to mind tart limes and lemons, perhaps white apricots and peaches, with peppery Asian spice accents. Has the weight of a great red wine, and is bone dry. Don't drink it too cold. Will age for a long time, perhaps a decade, in a cool cellar.",To Kalon Vineyard I Block,95,75.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Fumé Blanc,Robert Mondavi
42662,US,"A tremendous Cabernet, pure and refined, and undoubtedly the beneficiary of its great vintage. It's dry and elegant, with the slightly herbal tinge and soft tannins that Alexander Valley invariably lends. Yet the flavor profile is dominated by delicious, oak-inspired blackberries, cherries and currants. Brilliant and beautiful, and should develop for many years.",Vyborny Vineyard,95,70.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt
42663,US,"There's a beautiful wine in here, but it's buried under tannins. Also, the fruit is all primary blackberry, blueberry, raspberry and cherry jam, while the oak stands to the side, insistent in vanilla and toast. Nothing has merged, everything is separated. Yet this is a great wine, easily the greatest Cabernet to emerge from Livermore Valley in memory. Beautiful now, and should develop for a decade.",Ghielmetti Vineyard Clone 4,95,100.0,California,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Steven Kent
42664,US,"Expensive, but brilliant. At the forefront of California Sauvignon Blanc. Shows bright and clean acidity framing intense tangerine, lime and honey flavors, as well as complications from oak. Yet it finishes bone dry and elegant. Delicious and compelling, this wine lifts Sauvignon Blanc into entirely new territory.",Musque,95,40.0,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Chalk Hill
42665,US,"A beautiful, classy Cab, marked by smoky new oak and very ripe blackberry and cassis flavors, with a streak of minerals. The vineyard is in the Vaca Mountains, in the valley's far east. You can taste the sunshine in the wonderful fruitiness, and the tannins are extraordinarily refined, but they're also aggressive. Fine now, with a long decant, but should develop bottle complexity over many years.",Cloudy's Vineyard,95,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Janzen
42666,US,"A best-of-barrels selection from the winery's various vineyards, this is a lush, intricate Chardonnay made in the modern style. It's fantastically rich in pineapple tart flavors, with the sweet, smoky crust, and more acidic citrus notes of Meyer lemons and limes. Oak aging and lees add fortunate layers of buttered toast and cream. Very intricate, with Chablisian dryness and minerality. Now–2014.",Diana's,95,55.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Testarossa

42668,US,"Too young for drinking now, or anytime soon for that matter. It's all primary blackberry and currant fruit, new oak and tannins. But there's a dramatic quality to the structure, a purity of parts that suggests the cellar. There are waves of licorice, mocha and buttered cinnamon toast, with everything vying for supremacy. Let all the elements battle it out for a good six years. This wine should age gracefully through 2015, at least.",Estate Moose Valley Vineyard,94,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,D.R. Stephens
42669,Australia,"Lovely dessert-style Riesling at an extremely attractive price. It yields dried apricot aromas, then turns to honeyed marmalade in the mouth, just loaded with orange-apricot preserves. It's weighty and viscous, with a long, sweet finish. Should last through at least 2016.",The Noble Wrinkled,94,19.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Riesling,D'Arenberg
42670,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay for drinking now. It's dry and crisp, with pineapple, peach and pear flavors accented with vanilla oak and creaminess from lees aging. Despite the richness, there's a firm minerality, a tang of steel that makes the wine bracing. The grapes are from a vineyard in the southerly, cool Coombsville area, an area that needs its own appellation.",,94,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Hunnicutt
42671,US,"A beautiful, ultrafine Cabernet that shows rich blackberry, black currant, violet, cocoa and cedar flavors, and while it has tightly wound mountain tannins, it's entirely approachable now.

From the Davies family, of Schramsberg.",,94,40.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,JD
42672,US,"This is a wonderfully rich, seductive Pinot Noir. It has the lushness and complexity you want in a fine California bottling, with a silky texture and crisp acidity.

Lots of new oak, but it's perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume.",Tina Marie Vineyard,94,48.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fulcrum
42673,US,"A superb bubbly, almost entirely comprised of Chardonnay, with 2% Pinot Blanc. It's super-sophisticated, with that elegantly dry, crisp, yeasty feeling associated only with the best sparkling wines. Shows its California origins in the ripe lemon, lime and strawberry flavors that flatter, then pull back into a closure of minerals and spice. A great wine, although the mousse could be finer.",Le Rêve Blanc de Blancs,94,85.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Domaine Carneros
42674,US,"A gorgeous wine, dry and complex, whose natural fruit richness and acidity have been accented by full-bore Burgundian treatment of sur lies and oak barrel aging. It's basically a Sauvignon Blanc, with citrus flavors and a mouthwatering green fruit taste that suggests limes and kiwis. Combines a bracing quality with richness, and the result is compelling.",,94,40.0,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Sauvignon Gris,Chalk Hill
42675,US,"Talk about sensuous! This one's sheer silk and satin, a voluptuous wine that seduces the senses. Beyond the fabulous texture is a complex structure and tiers of flavors, such as fresh wild cherries and raspberries, bacon, black pepper and lots of sweet, smoky new oak. An absolutely gorgeous wine that should age for 6–8 years.",Rancho Ontiveros Vineyard,94,55.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Native 9
42676,US,"Shows all the richness you could want in a Chardonnay, with smoky, buttery flavors of pineapples, lemons and pears, wrapped into a smooth, creamy mouthfeel.

Good now, after a brief decant.",Oakville Terraces,94,70.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,De Sante
42678,US,"This vintage has the Horiuchi artist label. Another glorious wine from the 2007 vintage, full and forward, packed with plum and purple fruits.

The finish—thick and textural and darkly chocolaty—wraps around polished, elegant tannins.",,94,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,àMaurice
42679,US,"Quite a good, distinguished Cabernet. It's rich and robust, with explosive blackberry and currant flavors, liberally coated with smoky oak, that finish in a swirl of chocolate.

42680,US,"Very dry and tannic, as Petite Sirah should be. But unlike many “Pets,” it's also balanced and elegant. The official alcohol is only 13.5%, yet there's not a trace of greenness. In fact, the wine, which has plenty of French oak, is quite rich in blackberry and black currant flavors. Really a superb example, a Petite Sirah for Cabernet fans. Should evolve interestingly for many years.",Esoterica Chavez-Leeds Vineyard,94,40.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Petite Sirah,Kent Rasmussen
42681,US,"A beautiful wine that will redefine the way you view Lake County.

42682,US,"This wine's dense complexity is immediately apparent in the nose; offering hints of Asian spice, cinnamon, cardamom, along with supple layers of purple and black fruits.

42685,US,"A very finely crafted Pinot Noir, although it's also very young and wants some time in the cellar.

Beautiful now for the elaborate raspberry and cherry flavors, elaborated with beautiful oak, but better after 2013.",Doctor's Vineyard,94,54.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
42686,US,"Mostly Cabernet, with a small percentage of the other Bordeaux varieties, this is a very rich, dramatically layered wine. It's notable for both its intensely smooth tannins and the lush fruit, which suggests waves of raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, rose petals and oak, courtesy of 100% new French barrels. Yet there's an underlying minerality that gives firmness and grounding.

42689,US,"Extremely rich and ripe, with tremendous pineapple, pear, mango and white flower flavors that have been liberally oaked.

42909,US,"This is quite a nobly structured Pinot Noir. It's tempting to describe it as thin, because it trades opulence for dryness and a certain spicy minerality. But that would seriously underestimate its considerable appeal, not to mention the subtle hints of wild cherries and raspberries. The more you sip, the more you like it. At this price, a terrific value.",,93,25.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Alta Maria
42910,US,"Jewell threads the needle where so many others fail with this dry, elegant Sauvignon Blanc. Does exactly what it should, providing a mouthwateringly crisp white wine that scours and cleanses the palate. The flavors are of limes, lemons, grapefruits, wildflowers and stony, tangy minerals. Really a brilliant wine, among the best of its class.",Redwood Ranch,93,24.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Joseph Jewell
42911,US,"This single-vineyard blend's flavors run through all the berries right into dense cassis. It gathers more strength as it rolls through the midpalate, layering in earth and black cherries, with char and toast more noticeable than in the other Tamarack reds.",DuBrul Vineyard Reserve,93,45.0,Washington,Rattlesnake Hills,Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Tamarack Cellars
42912,US,"This is a unique Pinot Noir, different from almost everything else out there. Sourced from a vineyard in the Petaluma Gap region (perhaps a future AVA), it's bone dry, moderate in alcohol, and tannic. It has lighter, leaner flavors than most Pinots, with the fruit accompanied by herbs, minerals, flowers and mushrooms. Fans of super-fruity Pinots will find it unrich, but Burgundy lovers may think of Pommard. It will be fascinating to track this wine's progress.",Clos Madeleine,93,90.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Notre Vin
42913,US,"Super sweet, with vanilla honey, apricot preserves, tangerine tart and vanilla cream flavors. What's not to like? Best of all is crisp, tart acidity, like a squeeze of lemon, that brightens and heightens the richness and makes it finish clean.",Oley Sweet,93,20.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Novy
42914,US,"Opulence, lushness and a silky, seductive texture are what you expect from Pinot Noir, and this one delivers them all. It's bone dry and crisply clean in acidity, with subtle, complex flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, red currants, licorice, bacon and peppery spices. Easy to drink from the get-go, and gets more interesting as it warms in the glass.",,93,30.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Of The Place
42915,US,"This is only the third time the Chapter wine has been made since it debuted in 2002. It's a selection of the five or 10 best barrels—essentially the J. Bookwalter reserve. It is definitely the darkest and most muscular of the 2007's, and it builds upon thick tannins, liquorous oak and deep, rich, dark fruits. It's drinking well right now but should hold for up to a decade.",Chapter 3,93,78.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,J. Bookwalter
42916,US,"This is a reserve-style wine crafted from lots sourced from some of the winery's Napa mountain properties. It's not showing all that well now, due to hard, jagged tannins. Yet there are promising signs. The oak already is marrying the fruit, resulting in a seamless, smoky sweetness, and the tannins are entirely ripe. Should develop well over the next 6–8 years, possibly longer.",Synthesis Reserve,93,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Martin Ray
42917,US,"Very ripe and extracted, almost jammy, with primary fruit flavors of blackberries, black cherries, red plums, currants, dark chocolate and spices. Delicious and noble, but kind of immature. Give it 4–6 years to soften and integrate, and it could develop even longer.",Estate Grown & Produced,93,46.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Oakville Winery
42918,US,"This 100% Cabernet, from the iconic Klipsun vineyard, has been sourced from the original 1989 planting since the first crop, making Seven Hills Klipsun's longest standing customer. This offers deep cassis, mineral, and earth flavors, powerful and dense. The Seven Hills style, ordinarily restrained and elegant, suits this vineyard especially well, as it reins in the tendency of Klipsun fruit to go over the top, and become too tannic. This is muscular and deep, but proportionate and detailed.",Klipson Vineyard,93,32.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Seven Hills
42919,US,"Grown in the very cool central-southwestern part of the appellation, by Sebastopol, this Pinot features crisp, mouthwatering acidity. And, in this wonderfully long hangtime vintage, its flavors are extraordinarily rich and pure, brimming with cherries and raspberries. It shows layers of complexity, yet is too young, with the parts unintegrated. Give it 4–5 years in a cool cellar.",Jenkins Vineyard,93,70.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
42920,Chile,"Outstanding as always. Right from the first take it has an elevated sense of being. The nose is rich, warm and deeply fruited, with balsam wood and lemony notes. It's deep as a coal mine on the palate, with herbal, tobacco and leather accents sprucing up serious berry fruit flavors. Minty and sly on the finish, and lovely overall. Drink now through 2016.",Clos Apalta,93,80.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Red Blend,Lapostolle
42921,US,"Not for fans of rich Chardonnays, this is a very dry, acidic bottling. It's more about clean mouthfeel and scour than hedonism. What fruit there is suggests limes, pears and brisk minerals, while smoky oak and lees contribute toasty, buttery, creamy notes. A distinguished and elegant wine that defines cool-climate coastal conditions. Grows more complex and interesting as it warms in the glass.",Estate Grown,93,38.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pfendler
42922,New Zealand,"Plummy and dark, with accents of cedar, dark chocolate and hints of coffee. This is always the most robust of the Felton Road Pinots, and really deserves a few years in the cellar; although it's approachable now, expect the already soft tannins to turn silkier in time.",Block 5,93,79.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Felton Road
42923,US,"A very fine Cabernet, although it's tough and young and wants time in the cellar. Strikes you immediately as lush and important, with a fine structure framing ripe flavors of blackberries, black cherries, currants, anise, dark chocolate and sandalwood. Yet there's a juvenile character that, good as it is, promises even better things down the road. Give it until 2013, at least.",Game Ranch,93,70.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt
42924,US,"Dark, bold, and full-bodied, this is the perfect embodiment of power and breed in a full-on (five grape) Bordeaux blend. Boysenberry, cassis, plenty of acidity—the nose promises a great deal, though it is reticent in the mouth, and fairly acidic. This is a wine to lay down and enjoy in a decade.",Pentad Red Wine,93,50.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Seven Hills
42925,US,"A beautiful Pinot Noir, although it's a bit brusque in acidity. Still, it's enormously rich and dry, with long-lasting flavors of raspberry tart and cherry-cinnamon granola. Give it a brief decant, and drink with rich, umami-inspired fare, like teriaki salmon or cured meats.",Morelli Lane Vineyard,93,42.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
42926,US,"Lots to admire in this Cab. It's bone dry and rich in blackberry and cedar flavors, with overtones of mocha, anise and toast, and is very tannic. Clearly made in a leaner style than today's high-alcohol cult style, it trades some richness for elegance and finesse. This is a wine that puts its bet on cellaring. Try after 2013.",,93,75.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clos du Val
42927,US,"The palate can tell a superbly structured Cabernet from a flawed one, and this Cab shows off its pedigreed origins with flash. Great tannins, fine acidity, fully dry, and with a rich veneer of oak, it has perfectly ripened flavors of blackberries, currants, cherries and dark chocolate.",Dead Fred Vineyard,93,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Selene
42928,US,"You have to love the '07 vintage. This is drinking beautifully right now, though official release (September) is still a ways off. Rich and delicious, full-bodied and aromatic, with exotic barrel scents and a lovely mélange of chocolate, mocha, caramel and spice. But the fruit is the main story, and it's full, ripe and substantial—cherry and cassis, licorice and just a hint of leaf.",Red Wine,93,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Quilceda Creek
42929,US,"A very rich Chardonnay, notable for its complex flavors of pineapples, sweet Meyer lemons, Key lime pie, buttered toast and smoky caramelized oak. Acidity is quite high, and plays a role in the way it tingles and cleanses the mouth. There's a fresh, jammy quality that makes the wine taste younger than its almost three years. Should develop in the bottle through 2013.",Journey,93,75.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Matanzas Creek
42930,US,"Subtle floral and berry aromas intensify on the palate with crisp cherry and raspberry flavors in this elegant, brut-style rosé sparkler.

43080,US,"While this vineyard is close by the Russian River and is not considered the best of Rochioli's vineyards, winemaker Bob Cabral consistently makes its grapes into one of Williams Selyem's most compelling wines. This shows the impeccable tannins and acids of Rochioli fruit, with sweet, ripe, deep flavors of cherry and spice. Notes of pomegranate, rum punch, dark chocolate and smoky sandalwood add complexity. Beautiful to drink now, it should continue to develop for at least 10 years.",Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard,96,78.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
43081,Austria,"The lyra system of training vines is designed to give the fruit maximum exposure. With that and the vines' placement on the steep Heiligenstein hill, it's no surprise that this wine is ripe and rich. Perfumed, intense and generous, this will age for many years.",Zöbinger Heiligenstein Erste Lage Lyra Reserve,95,71.0,Kamptal,,,Riesling,Bründlmayer
43082,US,"This is superstrong Cabernet Sauvignon, with precise, concentrated flavors of brambly old-vine fruit taking center stage.

43083,US,"Always a standout, this is the only one of the Cayuse Syrahs that is cofermented with Viognier. This explodes with flavors of blueberries, soy, earth, black tea, iodine, anise and salt, plus a hint of sassafras. Notes of herb and cured meat add further interest to this unique, captivating effort.",Cailloux Vineyard,95,75.0,Oregon,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Oregon Other,Syrah,Cayuse
43084,US,"This shows the extraordinary richness and complexity that the winery's estate vineyard has exhibited over its lifetime. It's vast in cherry, red currant and licorice flavors, plus multiple layers of sautéed mushroom, exotic baking spice, mineral and sweet, smoky sandalwood. It's also very tannic, with a brisk spine of acidity. Good as it is, it needs time for all the parts to knit together. Better after 2018.",Williams Selyem Estate Vineyard,95,100.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
43085,US,"This best-of-barrels blend shows the powerful tannins and dryness that mark all of Turnbull's 2009 Cabernets. It's a huge wine, powerful and concentrated in blackberries, black currants and sweet dark chocolate, with notes of spices on the long, dry finish. Drink it now, with the best beef entrée you can find. It should slowly develop bottle-age characteristics over the next 8–10 years, at a minimum.",Estate Grown Black Label,95,100.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Turnbull
43086,US,"The pedigree of this rich Pinot Noir is evident right away in the mouthfeel, offering a silky and satiny texture, brightened with citrusy acidity. The flavors immediately kick in with a solid wall of red cherries, licorice, persimmons, pomegranates and cola. An exciting, complex wine to drink now, and it should gather momentum over six years, maybe even longer.",Olivet Lane,95,62.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
43087,Austria,"Pure and fruity, this has a fine line of steely acidity that cuts through the crisp apple fruit.

Keep for 4–5 years.",Loiser Berg Erste Lage Reserve,95,,Kamptal,,,Grüner Veltliner,Bründlmayer
43088,US,"This Grenache leaps into another dimension, with more concentration, earth, umami and salinity than ever before, yet it retains its elegance thanks to a crisp finish of raspberry and rock flavors. Reminiscent in a way to high-altitude Argentine Malbec, this will cellar well for a decade or more.",God Only Knows,95,85.0,Oregon,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Oregon Other,Grenache,Cayuse
43089,US,"A bit difficult to approach now, this has tight tannins that lock down the wine with astringency. Blended with a little Petit Verdot and Malbec, it slowly reveals massive layers of blackberries, cassis liqueur and dark chocolate, remaining stubbornly tight throughout. Many people will drink it soon with beef, and that's fine, especially with a good decant, but it should reward even more with 8–10 years in a proper cellar.",HaLo,95,175.0,California,Oak Knoll District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trefethen
43090,US,"Bergström's Sigrid is one of the finest Chardonnays made in Oregon. Racy and refined, it shows Burgundian finesse, toast and acidity.

43091,France,"Using fruit sourced from a single vineyard with great sun exposure, this wine takes its name from the stony soil. It provides great balance between the dense black fruit and the taut, minerally texture, expressing the essence of Malbec in Cahors. It certainly needs several years of aging.",Clos Triguedina Les Galets,95,25.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Jean-Luc Baldès
43092,US,"The Frog is a bit reductive, a bit shy in 2009 and needs extra decanting. With proper breathing time, it shows inviting notes of violets and strawberries, and it gains concentration through the midpalate, with additions of cherry and an almost liquid minerality. An almost delicate version of this wine.",Bionic Frog,95,90.0,Oregon,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Oregon Other,Syrah,Cayuse
43093,US,"This shows Merry Edwards' signature of exceptional deliciousness and drinkability, coupled with seemingly neverending depth. Made using fruit sourced from the winery's vineyard in the cooler southwestern part of the valley, near Sebastopol, this is rich in acids and soft tannins, but the flavors set it apart. Notes of raspberry, cherry, cola, tea, licorice, pepper and sandalwood abound and evolve with every sip.

43094,US,"For sheer voluptuous pleasure, this is one of Williams Sel-yem's best 2010s. It just floods the mouth with flavors of raspberry and cherry Pop-Tarts, with the most wonderful array of spices and a tender use of oak. Hard to keep from drinking it now, but it should age well over the next 8–10 years.",Bucher Vineyard,95,58.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem

43097,US,"This is very dry, with flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and chocolate, plus complex notes of herbs, spices and minerals. The tannins are a wonder—dusty and interesting. Really good to drink now, yet it should change gradually in the bottle over the next 10 years.",Coombsville Vineyard,94,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Antonio Patric
43098,France,"A ripe, new-wood-dominated wine, this is smooth and polished in feel, while the powerful tannins of rich Malbec are preserved. It's dense, dark and concentrated, and the plum and blackberry fruits are layered with the dry, firm tannins and are lightened by the juicy acidity. This needs at least 6–7 years to show its best.",GC,94,130.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Château du Cèdre
43099,US,"To call this Cabernet massive is an understatement. This is packed with blackberry and black currant flavors, complexed with dark licorice and dark chocolate notes, with a swirl of cinnamon spice on the finish. It's so powerful and delicious, you'll be tempted to drink it now, but don't. The tannins are very strong; the wine is very dry; and it will easily reward patience. Best after 2017.",Leopoldina,94,75.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Turnbull
43100,US,"Somewhat aloof now, this has grippy tannins that lock down the palate. Underneath the grip are complex flavors of juicy blackberry, plum sauce and exotic spice, with brooding earthy notes and sweet, smoky oak tones. Very fine, but one for the cellar.

43101,US,"This is a vibrant, lush and layered Cabernet- Sauvignon-dominated blend, with smaller percentages of Merlot, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc.

43105,US,"A dramatic Cabernet that shows Atlas Peak intensity and age-worthiness, this is bone dry, with hard tannins and zesty acidity.

43108,US,"An ultrarich Pinot Noir, this is dense and full bodied, with flavors of cherry pie, chocolate, cherry liqueur, graham cracker, spice and sandalwood.

43112,US,"Sweet cherry fruit, slathered in whiskey barrel new oak flavors (25 months in both French and American barrels) is the story here.

43113,Australia,"The uncharacteristically quiet nose, with subtle mineral and quince hints, make this a good choice for those looking for a more subdued style of Australian Riesling. The palate continues this stony austerity and adds some lemon rind tones which fade into lime on the medium finish. Admirable for its restraint.

The nose is on the subtle side, but not lacking in complexity, with layers of coffee, vanilla, tar and chocolate-covered cherries.

43259,France,"Lean red fruit and sweet spice aromas lead the way on the bouquet of this blend, made from 45% Syrah, 30% Mourvèdre, 10% Grenache and 15% Carignan.

43262,South Africa,"While this is certainly on the higher end of South African Shiraz price points, it's worth the investment. The intense bouquet is loaded with rich dark cherry, raspberry, sweet spice and small wild strawberries. All-spice and pepper dominate the creamy mouth, with opulent flavors of meaty plum, roasted espresso and black cherry guts. Full and powerful in the mouth with a strong vanilla-accented finish. Delicious now but worthy of cellar time as well.",The Stork,92,79.0,Stellenbosch,,,Shiraz,Hartenberg

You can smell the violets amidst nicely layered aromatics, built upon layers of black fruits, cassis and dark, smoky elements.

43276,US,"Lushly aromatic and toasty, the substantial oak flavors are set against deep, brambly berry and cassis fruits.

43277,US,"A vigorous, masculine Pinot Noir. Dark in color, tannic and acidic, it has the weight of Grenache, although with silkier tannins.

43344,US,"A good, brisk, dry wine that's somewhat tough and resistant now, but seems to have the stuffing for the cellar. The tannins are strong and make for a sandpapery mouthfeel.

43633,New Zealand,"Production (and pricing) of this wine have moved up considerably since 2005, when it represented a pretty good value at $23.

43649,Spain,"A touch minty and dry smelling, with simple, solid, slightly underdeveloped flavors. All in all, it's hard to find much brightness in this wine; instead it's subdued and chocolaty, and it never really crosses the Rubicon of ripeness.

44135,US,"Shows the voluminous fruit and full body that Laetitia Pinots typically possess, with huge, mouthfilling flavors of cherries, raspberries, red currants, cola and sandalwood. Also pretty tannic. But the notable feature is tart acidity. Not a big problem, but the palate feels it like a bee sting. Best now–2013.",La Coupelle,91,60.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Laetitia
44136,Chile,"One of the best value-priced, big and rich wines you're likely to find.

Very ripe but really well made.",Casa,91,13.0,Rapel Valley,,,Carmenère,Lapostolle
44137,US,"A crisp mix of black cherry, iron filings, moist earth, and dry, dry tannins, it needs more time in bottle and cellar to flesh out.

44138,US,"A seductive nose, densely loaded with black currants and smoke, leads into a textural, single-vineyard, 100% Cabernet with great varietal presence and definition. It needs to breathe open, which puts on more flesh, and starts to unpack the layers. Streaks of mineral, iron, graphite and more cassis roll into the finish.",Seven Hills Vineyard,91,32.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Seven Hills
44139,Italy,"Here's a plush, modern Barbera d'Alba with bright fruit and berry tones followed by softer notes of cinnamon and chocolate. On the whole it is a well-integrated wine, although there is power and density here that suggests a pairing with lasagna or thickly cheesy pasta.",Scarrone,91,45.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Vietti
44140,US,"Rich in cherry and raspberry pie filling flavors, with red currant, cola and exotic pomegranate notes and a super-spicy finish. Bone dry, this Pinot shows the classy elegance of its vineyard source. On the downside is very tart acidity, as if the wine contained a big squirt of lime juice.

44141,Italy,"Here is a bright and modern Barbera d'Alba with succulent fruit tones followed by chocolate and exotic spice.

44142,New Zealand,"Eradus continues a successful run with this year's Sauvignon Blanc. As usual, it's fairly pungent and herbal upfront, but then delivers waves of passion fruit.

44143,Chile,"Starts out foxy and mossy, with leather, char, earth and herbal notes. The palate is nothing if not saturated and big, and the flavors run toward baked, meaty black fruits.

44145,US,"This is still a little hard and tight, but shows great ripe red berry fruit and well-balanced tannins.

44147,US,"Lots of crisp, citrusy acidity in this wine, which brightens the pineapple, orange, lemon and lime flavors. Meanwhile, 100% new oak adds a rich coating of smoky, buttered toast.

44148,US,"Lovely juice, a concentrated mouthful of cranberry and raspberry fruit, from the Forgotten Hills vineyard.

44766,US,"Aged in neutral oak and 100% varietal, this is a fine value. There is great fruit flavor—raspberry and Bing cherry—supported with natural acidity and just a hint of chocolate. This could be a Dry Creek Zinfandel, in terms of its bright berry fruit and lively acidity.",Wahluke Slope Vineyard,90,16.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Sangiovese,Arbor Crest
44767,US,"A very pretty Merlot, and a good price for the elegant quality. It's dry and tannic, showing the Clos du Val style of controlled, somewhat aloof ripeness. There's a rich, attractive core of black cherry fruit. Will develop for a few years, but it's really best now, with a brief decant.",,90,26.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Clos du Val
44768,Italy,"Chocolate, coffee and espresso come to life thanks to the solid base of natural fruit that keeps the wine lively and fresh. Fruit and oak-related aromas work well together and give the wine brightness, softness and a velvety texture.",La Luna e Le Stelle,90,19.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,,Barbera,Dezzani
44769,Italy,"Here's a nicely balanced Barbera d'Asti Superiore from the Nizza subzone that shows not too much fruit and not too much oak. The wine is clean and polished and delivers light steps on the palate, unlike some of the much denser and heavier expressions you will find. Very nice and elegant.",Canto di Luna,90,,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti Superiore Nizza,,Barbera,Cascina Guido Berta
44770,US,"Another fine value from Kirkland, the Costco house brand. Vineyard sources are first rate, mostly Wahluke Slope, and the wine has exceptional grip, depth and structure for Merlot at this price point. Cassis, dark plum, black cherry, licorice, espresso and smoke are woven together nicely. Tannins are lush, substantial and quite ripe; they wrap up the wine with a blanket of smoke and tar. A great steak wine.",,90,10.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Kirkland Signature
44771,US,"A very good Chardonnay, fancy and elegant, although it's a little sharp in the mouth, and lacks a certain hedonistic appeal, especially at this price. Shows dry, oak-inspired flavors of pineapples, green apples and pears, with a firm minerality.",Corral Vineyard,90,46.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse
44772,Italy,"This dense, ruby-colored Barbera delivers aromas of plush fruit, drying mineral, toasted nut and moist tobacco.

44774,France,"Very dry, dark, boasting extreme tannins along with solid, chunky fruit. The wine has acidity, black plum skins and licorice to go with this dense structure. A powerful wine.",Clos Triguedina,90,,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Jean-Luc Baldès
44775,Australia,"Representing a good value in top-flight Cabernet, Jim Barry's 2008 The Cover Drive (a cricketing term) features subtle hints of cinnamon, coffee and vanilla layered over blueberry and plum fruit. It's on the full-bodied side, with plush, velvety tannins balanced by crisp acids. Drink now–2018.",The Cover Drive,90,18.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jim Barry

44777,Italy,"Smooth and sophisticated with rich blackberry and plum aromas backed by oak-driven tones of spice and leather, this is a very rich expression of Barbera (that sees eight months in oak barrels). The overall effect is excellent and the mouthfeel culminates with bright tones of prune and crushed black pepper.",Rinaldi,90,20.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Marziano Abbona
44778,France,"Crisp red apples and tight fruit skins give this wine a taut, lively character. Just a touch of caramel to broaden the acidity.",,90,18.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire,,Rosé,Mas de Cadenet
44779,Australia,"Gold in color, with an ebullient nose of spiced melon and sweet flavors of candied pineapple tinged with white pepper and grapefruit.

44780,US,"Winemaker Joe Forest has brightened the fruit and livened up the mouthfeel by blending in 20% Grenache. Fresh raspberry flavors are wrapped into the earthier, herbal, lightly chocolaty character of the Syrah. Once-filled French barrels were used.",,90,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Tempus Cellars
44781,South Africa,"It's unfortunate that only 56 cases of this wine were imported, so be sure to snag it when you see it. Intense and powerful on the nose, with attractive forest, licorice, tea leaves and menthol adding complexity to the small red berries and plum skins. The velvety texture and firm structure lead nicely into the mocha-flavored finish, with flecks of white pepper gleaming through on the very end.",,90,37.0,Stellenbosch,,,Shiraz,Thelema
44782,Chile,"This winery, part of the San Pedro group, is on the right path as its wines have improved in recent vintages. This particular wine marks a high-water point; the nose mixes dry wood notes, leather, herbal berry and even some fine aged cheese.

44783,New Zealand,"Back on form after the disappointing 2008, Nobilo's Icon deftly combines hints of honey and stone fruit with a leafy overlay of herbal flavors.

44784,Australia,"Sidewood's consulting winemaker, Nathasha Mooney (who made the still-stunning 1998 E&E; Black Pepper Shiraz while at Barossa Valley Estate), is putting together some excellent wines that also represent good value, including this grapefruit-scented Sauvignon Blanc. This medium-bodied offering is long and intense, blending citrus with minerally spice reminiscent of white pepper.",,90,16.0,South Australia,Adelaide Hills,,Sauvignon Blanc,Sidewood
44785,US,"This Bordeaux blend shows an interesting range of fruit flavors and textures from the blend, which includes Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Merlot. The flavors tend toward red fruits, as in cherries and red currants, while the tannins are quite strong. Shows an immaturity now that strongly suggests 5–6 years in the cellar.",Estate Blend Private Reserve,90,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sodaro
44786,Italy,"This is a rich and chocolaty expression of Barbera d'Alba with thick concentration and immediate aromas of black currant and cherry.

44787,US,"Made from very old vines, this is a big, bold Zinfandel. It's packed with wild berry and stone fruit flavors, with peppery spices and notes of dark chocolate, licorice and Canadian bacon. Quite a good, complicated wine, but also very tannic. Some ultraripe flavors give it a Porty finish. Drink now.",Vineyard 1869,90,45.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Scott Harvey
44788,Italy,Here's a balanced and sophisticated Barbera d'Asti Superiore with oak tones that seem to jive well with the natural intensity of the fruit flavors.

44789,US,"A good buy, compared to Roessler's more expensive bottlings. It's a county-wide blend, and quite a nice one.

44790,US,"This wine could be served as an apéritif, digestif or dessert, alongside a bowl of vanilla ice cream and fresh strawberries and peaches. Wildly fragrant aromas of orange blossom and ripe peach make it just the right match. It's gorgeous, light and semidry, with acidity that lingers through the midpalate.",Small Lot,88,25.0,California,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Orange Muscat,Wente
44791,Portugal,"A ripe and creamy blend of Fernão Pires and Arinto, this is both fresh and richly textured. It has weight as well as a smooth texture, full in the mouth while also tangy.

44792,US,"A juicy blend of 86% Mourvèdre and 14% Grenache this is a bang-up value for subtle blueberry and crushed blackberry layers amid a sanguine, earthy core.

44795,Austria,"It shows an altogether riper aspect of Grüner. Yellow pear, yellow plum and notions of peach appear and give way to a rounded, generous palate with lots of phenolic backbone and structure. It can definitely shine with substantial food.",Steinberg,88,18.0,Wagram-Donauland,,,Grüner Veltliner,Fritsch
44796,US,"This is a Captain America-sized Zin, muscular and strong in walls of huge, dusty dark fruit. Firm in tannins, juicy and swirling in vanilla and cinnamon toast flavors, it spent 22 months swaddled in French oak, an imprint that lets itself be known in the wine. Lay this baby down until 2015 or so, or let it breathe before enjoying with racks of ribs.",Lizzy James Vineyard,88,35.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Zinfandel,Harney Lane
44797,Portugal,"Still young and closed up, this wine is all about the future. It has rich fruits contrasted with ripe acidity, and is given a push by the wood-aging flavor. It will need some time, so don't drink this generous wine until 2017.",Herdade Perdigão Reserva,88,28.0,Alentejo,,,Portuguese Red,Herdade do Perdigão

44799,US,"A new project from Jackson Family Wines from the Boone Ridge Vineyard, this is a voluptuous Pinot delivers a substantial mouthfeel of dark blueberry fruit and mushroomy earth.

44800,France,"It would be a shame to drink this lightly sweet wine now, even though it is delicious.

44804,Portugal,"Produced from Alvarinho grown in the southern Minho region, near the Douro Valley, this is a particularly crisp and fruity wine. Great streaks of acidity give it a fresh character. It needs to age a few months to round it out; drink from 2015.",,88,13.0,Minho,,,Alvarinho,Aveleda
44805,US,"This is a young, meaty Pinot, a bottle of substantial red cherry, earthy mushroom and soil that's bright and layered with a heartiness to the texture and finish.

44806,Portugal,"Solid and firm, it has powerful tannins and no sense yet of aging. The concentration is palpable, offering impressive weight while also bringing out ripe berry fruits. It needs until 2017–2018 to soften.",Grande Reserva,88,60.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Barão de Vilar
44807,Portugal,"This attractive wine has a fine, dusty structure that balances well with the rich berry fruits. Sweet tannins and layers of acidity meld well.

44808,Portugal,"Richly structured, this wine has a fine future. Dark berry fruits, sweet tannins and just enough acidity are combining well to give a wine that is both firm and fruity. Give this solid, balanced wine until 2017.",Dona Matilde Tinto,88,,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta Dona Matilde
44809,Germany,"Streaks of lanolin and petrol lend a savory, mineral intensity to this off-dry wine.

44812,France,"This rich wine is developing slowly. Even after a year, its fruit is still youthful with bright acidity and tangy citrus. It is beginning to round out and show a riper side. Wait until 2015.",L'Enclos de Maimbray,88,30.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Matthias et Emile Roblin
44813,Portugal,"Ripe and jammy, this up-front wine has some firm tannins, but these are buried in the full-bodied fruitiness. A layer of acidity gives the wine shape and the potential for some aging. Drink from 2016.",Conde de Vimioso Reserva,88,40.0,Tejo,,,Portuguese Red,Falua
44814,Portugal,"A ripe, spicy and juicy wine that has good acidity and balanced tannins. It's a blend: the smooth character of the Aragonez (aka Tempranillo) combines with the more tannic firmness of Cabernet Sauvignon. Together, they produce a fruity, structured wine that is ready to drink.",Tagus Creek Tinto,88,12.0,Tejo,,,Portuguese Red,Falua
44815,Portugal,"A fresh, fruity lemon and pink grapefruit flavored wine, this is brightly full of acidity; a crisp and mineral texture creates a refreshing character. Ready to drink.",Quinta de São Cristóvão,88,,Lisboa,,,Portuguese White,Félix Rocha
44816,Austria,Rounded acidity recalls the freshness of green apple and pear rather than that of citrus. Very clean and streamlined but with pleasant substance and just a little enticing spritz. Simple but very pleasant.,,88,,Wagram-Donauland,,,Riesling,Fritsch

44818,Austria,"Fragrant oak spice invites you to contemplate a mix of autumnal, ripe red fruit: plums perhaps, in a compote with strawberry. Mellow tannins come with echoes of clove and cinnamon. This friendly and soft red also works without food.",Gaissberg,88,33.0,Austria,,,Red Blend,H. & M. Hofer
44819,Portugal,"Although the wine is closed at the moment, showing only its tannic side, it has a good promise from the weight of fruit that's at the back. Ripe and juicy, it should age well. Drink from 2017.",Terras de Monforte,88,8.0,Alentejo,,,Portuguese Red,Herdade do Perdigão
44820,Spain,"Rooty, tough aromas are brambly, while the palate is narrow in feel, drying and tastes of herbal raspberry and cherry. Quite snappy and a little sharp, with a quick finish of red fruit, tomato and zest. Could improve with aging, but at this point the wine, while solid, seems lacking in stuffing.",Reserva,85,,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Pedrosa
44821,US,"Front-loaded with lemon, lime, grapefruit, gooseberry and honeysuckle flavors, this friendly Sauv Blanc is basically dry. It turns racy with acidity toward the finish. A nice, versatile white wine for drinking anytime.",,85,19.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Sawyer

44823,Spain,"For a Ribera rosé, this gets it mostly right. The nose is neutral and standard, while the spunky palate sports good acidity and flavors of strawberry and raspberry. Wet and refreshing on the finish, and good overall.",Rosado,85,10.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Recorba
44824,Spain,"Smells a bit cheesy and sour at first, and soon after oak and mild berry fruit take over. On the palate, it's dry, peppery and grabby, with solid but common plum and raspberry flavors. Tomato notes and herbal flavors come up on the finish, but all together it's a good but regular Ribera wine.",Vendimia Seleccionada,85,19.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Resalte
44825,Germany,"A perky, zesty wine, with appealing moss and honeysuckle scents followed by a grapefruit peel character in the mouth. Feels soft and light on the palate but finishes clean. Drink up.",Rhein River,85,10.0,Rheinhessen,,,Riesling,Rudi Wiest

44827,Australia,A tame nose of cream and toast leads to a fairly weighty palate of butter and apples that's punctuated by attractive guava notes. The nutty finish is just this side of medium. Drink up.,Four O'Clock,85,16.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Chardonnay,Spring Seed Wine Co.

44829,US,"Good spicy flavors in this briary, brambly wine. Tastes like freshly picked wild berries in the forest, with notes of pine, anise and pepper.

44830,US,"Mildly spritzy, sweet and orange flavored, this low-alcohol, frizzanté-style bubbly is a very pleasant springtime quaffer. Serve it quite cold, and it can open or close a picnic in style.",Semi-Sparkling,85,15.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Muscat,Tualatin Estate
44831,Italy,This Prosecco Brut opens with a neutral nose although there are some distant hints of peach and citrus to keep it interesting.

44833,France,"An intriguing wine, a blend of Riesling and Pinot Gris, showing developed aromas of char and spice. There's precious little fruit here, though a few apple notes inform the medium-bodied palate. Hay and lanolin flavors on the finish dissipate a bit too quickly.",L'Ame de la Terre Val D'Eleon,85,38.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Alsace white blend,Marc Kreydenweiss

44835,New Zealand,"A hint of flintiness adds a touch of austerity to the nose, which otherwise features pineapple and quince. This off-dry wine is on the tart side; citrus and melon notes pick up a trace of bitterness on the finish.",,85,23.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Gris,Maude
44836,Spain,"For a Priorat red, this is lean and snappy, with hot, stemmy aromas and light-bodied, racy fruit flavors. It's a blend of six different grapes, and overall it comes across just well enough to be worth a go. That said, it is kind of short and scratchy given its domain.",,85,15.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,La Ninota
44837,US,"Too ripe and simple in jammy pineapples, tangerines and apricots to stimulate interest, and although it's dry, the acidity tastes unnatural. Shows the difficulties of crafting a fine white wine in Paso Robles.",Volado,85,32.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Viognier,Oso Libre

44839,Spain,"Dark in color but a bit hot and clunky on the nose, where oak-based vanilla helps mask its true identity, which is choppy and tart.

44847,US,"Distinctive, with a strong flavor of cherry—much beyond the usual cherry found in many red wines. The fruit is backed with stiff tannins, slightly herbal, and a streak of vanilla/caramel. The finish is incomplete; the fruit drops off and the wine turns gluey.",Black Label,85,20.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Kason
44848,Australia,"Bright and limey, with butterscotch notes punctuating the citrus fruit. The crisp palate is light-to-medium- bodied and winds up on a fleeting mineral note. Try with halibut. Best now to 2011.",,85,19.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Chardonnay,Vasse Felix
44849,Spain,"A touch stalky on the nose, but after that it gets things mostly right. The fruit aromas and flavors are subdued, with jammy raspberry notes leading the way.

44850,US,"This bone-dry, full-bodied Syrah has firm tannins and intense concentration. It's a little warm in alcohol, with flavors of dark chocolate, blackberry jam, cassis liqueur, grilled bacon and black pepper, plus a coating of sweet, smoky oak.

44854,US,"This has a squeeze of lime-like acidity that cuts across the broad, rich cherry-pie, red licorice and spicy sandalwood flavors, which come with a touch of funky leather. For all of that fruit, it has a remarkably delicate mouthfeel, and it finishes dry and clean. It's very hard to predict this wine's future, but it's beautiful now to drink after a few hours in the decanter, and it should be fine over the next four years.",Katherine Lindsay Estate,91,85.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Paul Hobbs

45585,Chile,"There's a funky, strange quality to San Pedro's high-end 2008 Syrahs from Elqui. Like the Kankana ultrapremium bottling, this wine is jammy and exotic smelling, with mulchy notes, rubber and horsey aromas. It's chunky and full in the mouth, with prune, vanilla and canned asparagus flavors. Has the weight and density but smells and tastes too odd to rate higher.",1865 Limited Edition,85,25.0,Elqui Valley,,,Syrah,San Pedro
45586,Chile,"Blocky on the nose, with mild heat and burn to go with standard raspberry aromas. Feels full, with a resiny, oak-based thickness in front of chunky flavors of raspberry and plum.

45594,Spain,"This may appeal more to some than others because barrel-fermented Viura is a tough row. Smells a lot like creamed corn or wheat, with apple cider on the side.

45663,New Zealand,"Possibly just in a sullen phase, this reserve bottling from Craggy's home vineyard is dominated for the moment by smoke and cedar on the nose, and while there is some cherry fruit apparent in the mouth, it doesn't appear to be fully expressing itself.

46869,US,"Three Rivers makes only a limited amount of this interesting Cab Franc. The fruit is pure blueberry, the tannins just ripe enough, the oak restrained.

46870,US,"Comes from a little-understood part of the sprawling Sonoma Coast, a place near San Pablo Bay yet to prove itself. There are ripe, rich, young vine flavors of cherry pie and cola, with a very sharp bite of tartness. Think of opulence versus acidity. Hard to tell which side wins. Drink now, for fresh, jammy fruitiness.",Griffin's Lair,89,46.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Roessler
46871,Chile,"A really nice and pure bargain-priced Cabernet, which is still what Chile excels at.

46872,US,"Dark, tannic and toasty, it's a rich mouthful of wine. The fruit is moderately ripe, with light berry flavors; but the toast and chocolate and coffee barrel flavors add a lot of weight and punch.

46874,France,"This has to be an important wine from the weight of the bottle and, with a broad take on rosé, this lives up to the billing. The wine is fat, the acidity a less important element than the ripe red berry fruit flavors.",Grande Réserve,88,,Provence,Côtes de Provence,,Rosé,Château la Moutète
46875,France,"It is less and less common to see the traditional bulbous Provençal bottle, but this simple and attractive wine fits well inside.

46877,Chile,"Big, dark, earthy and rubbery, with hefty black fruit on the nose and palate. A generous wine with toasty blackberry, cassis and a sprinkle of chocolate, and then a smooth finish.

46888,Italy,"You'll find bright berry notes followed by white licorice, forest floor and a distant touch of chopped herbs in this fresh, well-integrated Barbera from Monferrato.

46894,US,"This Claret combines Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc into a sturdy, tannic, slightly sweaty wine with only the barest hints of black fruits.

46906,Spain,"Quite dilute, with gaseous, chemical aromas that subside with time but never really leave. The palate is dry, mulchy and briney, and dig as you might, there is never much fruit to latch onto. Too thin, even for a cool year like 2007.",Cosecha,82,15.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Peña Roble
46907,Australia,"This would have turned out better with more delicate handling. The fruit seems to have some potential but it is drowned by a thick layer of oak that sits on top of the wine.

46914,Uruguay,"Straightforward and honest with aromas of Fernet Branca and bing cherries in a medium-bodied frame. Short, tannic finish.

46915,Spain,"Stemmy and green, with herbal, earthy aromas. The palate doesn't offer much besides acid, stemmy flavors and herbal notes, and there's a spot of green bitterness to the finish. Not a lot going on here; acceptable at best.",,82,11.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Tempranillo,No Time

46925,Spain,"Earthy, meaty and leathery, with an herbal quality to the bouquet. The palate is chunky and soupy, with stewed berry, latent sweetness, and a mild herbal aftertaste.

46926,Spain,"A big, dark, heavily oaked wine with caramel, resin and baked berry aromas.

47495,US,"Often the best of a stellar Syrah lineup, the 2007 Clifton Hill designate is firm, tight and dense – still showing a youthful shell. Co-fermented with three percent Viognier, the black cherry fruit carries compact layers of graphite, bitter chocolate and dried herb. The concentration and length suggest that this is the most cellarworthy of the Bunnell Family Syrahs.",Clifton Hill Vineyard,93,42.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Bunnell Family Cellar
47496,US,"This is a very big, deeply flavored and densely concentrated wine. It's so powerful, you might want to age it for a few years.

47497,US,"Here's a big, thick, full-bodied and extracted wine that captures the essence of Dry Creek Valley Zin. Its marked by extremely briary, brambly flavors of wild blue and black berries and cola. Then the spices kick in, starting with black pepper, ranging through cinnamon and star anise, and then finishing with black pepper. Totally, completely bone dry and quite tannic and acidic, this Zinfandel needs rich fare, and should develop in the bottle over the next 4–5 years.",,93,26.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Unti

47502,US,"Here's a big, triumphant Petite Sirah that shows everything fans of the varietal love.

47504,US,"Don't even think of opening this Cab now. The tannins are hard, and they lock down the considerable blackberry, black currant, anise and dark chocolate flavors. It's a very fine wine.

47505,US,"The most massive, dense and ageworthy of all the Sparkman reds, this Kingpin Cabernet is a barrel selection of the darkest, deepest wines in the cellar. Almost pure cassis fruit is matched to a firm, steely spine. Tannins are strong but not heavy, and the aging in two thirds new wood has not turned the wine terribly oaky. Hints of rock, tobacco and earth promise more flavor development over the next decade.",Kingpin,92,56.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sparkman
47506,US,"This is the most citrusy of Testarossa's '07 Chards, brimming with Meyer lemon, lime and pineapple flavors.

It offers more complexity and detail than the rest of the Spring Valley line-up, and carries its almost 15% alcohol well. Whiffs of wood smoke, tobacco, and marzipan lead into a lovely mix of red fruits, spices and barrel flavors. It's just a bit hot in the finish; and the tannins seem attenuated, but that may be due to its youth. A fine bottle.",Uriah Red Wine,92,50.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Spring Valley Vineyard
47514,US,"Native yeast, weekly batinage (lees stirring) in 50% new barrels, and, most importantly, a superb vineyard—Stillwater Creek—make for the best Chardonnay yet from Sparkman.

Notes of black cherry, blackberry and roasted espresso beans fill the nose and lead right through to the medium-weight mouth along with flavors of black plum skins and olive.

47518,France,"Winemaker Pierre Jehan's interpretation of Corton-Charlemagne for Henri de Villamont is to retain great fruit, but not to produce a wine with too much weight.

47519,US,"Hard to believe this Sauvignon Blanc never saw oak, because it has a vanilla bean flavor that must come from the grapes alone, although lees aging surely contributes to the creaminess. The underlying flavors are complex, ranging from Meyer lemons and sweet limes to exotic tropical quince, kiwi and guava and just a touch of gooseberry. Best of all is the acidity, which brightens everything. A great Dry Creek Sauvignon Blanc.",,92,28.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Stephen & Walker

47524,Spain,"A warm, aggressive wine with baked berry aromas, kirsch, bacon and rubber. The palate has hard, astringent tannins but the flavors are good once they air out; there's blackberry, plum and brown sugar. Firms up on the finish as the tannins do their thing.

47531,Chile,"Floral smelling but also leafy and rubbery, with an overriding set of cheesy, leathery aromas.

47546,US,"Arctos is more Cab-centric than its sibling Ursa, but in 2007 it must take second place. The blend is about two thirds Cab Sauvignon, with the other four Bordeaux grapes also represented.

47579,US,"The 11th vintage of Abacela's Albariño is a racy wine, with excellent varietal character. Fruit flavors suggest a mix of cucumber, apple, citrus and melon.

47580,US,"Nice flavors of cherries, cola, currants and cedar in this Pinot Noir, with the silky texture you want from the Central Coast.

47581,Chile,"Mildly sharp on the nose, with a bit of charred, burnt character, while the mouth has snap and medium weight to support red raspberry and plum flavors that carry an herbal edge. Finishes peppery with some scratch, but overall it's solid wine and reasonably good for the price.",,84,7.0,Central Valley,,,Merlot,TerraNoble
47582,US,"Soft, gentle and fruity, a dry, polished Merlot that's a pretty good buy for the price. Shows nice flavors of blackberries, currants, anise, herbs and oak.",,84,11.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Thomas
47583,Australia,"Juicy and crisp, what this wine lacks in concentration it makes up for in charm. The nose overflows with red raspberry, vanilla and coconut scents that slide into Morellino cherries in the mouth before finishing up with solid hit of acidity. Try with salmon. Drink now to one year.",Charleston,84,24.0,South Australia,Adelaide,,Pinot Noir,Nepenthe
47584,US,"Pretty obvious in sun-ripened blackberries and cherries that are sweet and jammy, while sweet oak adds vanilla and caramel richness. It's all flavor but not much structure. Drink now.",,84,35.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Optima

47590,Argentina,"If you catch this wine soon, meaning before it goes belly up, you may like its peachy simplicity and ample palate weight.

Pepper and more spice work the finish.",Sibaris Reserva Especial,88,15.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Undurraga

47932,France,"Medium-pink in color, this looks immediately vibrant and fruity. Scents of mealy plum, berry and watermelon fill the bouquet, while the palate offers more austere flavors of red currant and sour pomegranate. Tart and sharp in acidity, the finish is short and brisk.",,86,15.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Languedoc,,Rosé,Hecht & Bannier
47933,US,"Think of a pink version of Beaujolais Nouveau. The grapy flavors light up this light-bodied, extroverted rosé even more than the almost fluorescent pink color.

47934,Portugal,"This wine still shows its youthful tannins. Juicy acidity brings up the blackberry and blueberry. A touch of bitterness will blow away, giving an attractive, fruity wine by 2016.",Alfaraz Colheita Seleccionada,86,15.0,Alentejano,,,Portuguese Red,Henrique José de La Puente Sancho Uva
47935,Portugal,"With chocolate as well as fruit flavors, this is a structured wine. A bitter edge gives the juicy damson fruit a jolt. However, it should develop well to give a ripely textured wine from 2016.",Vinha do Almo,86,9.0,Alentejano,,,Portuguese Red,Herdade do Perdigão

47940,US,"A terrific Cabernet, so balanced and elegant it's classic Napa Valley. Rich in blackberries, black currants, herbs and cedar, with a perfect touch of smoky oak, and so smooth and complex, you keep returning for a second and third glass. Long Meadow Ranch is a winery that consistently overdelivers.",,93,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Long Meadow Ranch
47941,US,"A glamorous wine, rich and complex, with lots going on. Lacks perhaps some of the depth of, say, the '03 and '04, more on a par with the 2007, but still a very fine Insignia. With rich blackberry and cassis flavors wrapped into thick tannins and fine new oak sweetness, it's nowhere ready to drink now.

47943,US,"As good as the 2007, Hall's '08 Segassia is vastly rich in sweet, pure blackberry and cherry fruit flavors. New oak, to the tune of 85%, adds important notes of sweet caramel and buttered toast. This is not your typical Mount Veeder Cab, but much softer and riper than you might expect. Delicious now and for the next several years.",Segassia Vineyard,93,150.0,California,Mount Veeder,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hall
47944,US,"This is a blend of the various vineyards Conn Creek has access to. It is a splendid testimony to the winemaker's ability to take disparate lots and make them harmonious.

47953,Argentina,"Different than past Chacayes wines in that it's more floral and exotic, and less about pure power.

47954,US,"There's a dusty, tannic dryness to this wine that makes it tough to drink now.

47956,US,"Just one word for this Zin: delicious.

47963,US,"Fruit is the hallmark of this blend, based on Cabernet Sauvignon but with one-third Merlot. It's flamboyant in blackberries and cherries, so ripe and pure, while oak adds an equal measure of sweet toast and smoke. With firm, ripe tannins, this wine needs time in the cellar.

47966,US,"A big, vital Syrah, massively packed with intense blackberry fruit, in the way of Mount Veeder reds. It's distinctly Syrah-esque, with pepper and bacon flavors, and the winemaker has added a deft layer of smoky oak. Very good, but young and sweetly immature. Needs time.

47971,Germany,"Superstar Egon Müller has at least kept his basic Riesling at an affordable level. At first, it's almost odorless, but give it a chance to develop in the glass and delicate apple, fern and lime notes emerge. A hint of CO2 adds to the impression of lightness, and the wine finishes crisp, racy and clean.

48010,Canada,"There's incredible depth of both flavor and texture in this golden icewine from Inniskillin. Initially, it's rich and creamy on the tongue with notes of honey, waxy florals and apple. Then, bright flashes of acidity bring forth tones of tangerine and Meyer lemon. Long and languorous on the finish, it's a gorgeous wine all around.",Icewine,92,60.0,Ontario,Niagara Peninsula,,Vidal Blanc,Inniskillin
48011,US,"Shows the richness, dryness and softness of Jaffurs' new red wines, but also Petite Sirah's powerful tannins, and there's a streak of acidity that balances out the fruit.

48012,US,"The blend is 61% Syrah, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Mourvèdre and 1% Cinsault. The stiffest, most tannic and compact of the Doyenne reds, the Aix hits a high point in 2008. The Syrah brings berry, citrus and a savory note; the Cabernet adds muscle and cassis. Tannins are hard, polished, almost shiny. There is a lot of depth and power here, and it needs decanting or additional cellaring to show all of its strengths.",Aix Red,92,36.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Doyenne
48013,US,"A great find from the Livermore Valley, whose pockets of coolness lend complexity to the valley's wines, this Syrah is delicate and lively, feminine in style with subtle fruit and sage notes and nicely wound acid.",Estate Vineyards,92,20.0,California,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Fenestra
48014,US,"This is the artist label Syrah; impenetrably black, richly scented and intriguing. The fruit is tart and has a citrus edge, but more noticeable are the scents and textures of spices—clove, pepper, cayenne, a bit of fennel and ginger. The longer it breathes, the smoother and more interesting the flavors become.",Lewis Vineyard,92,75.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Dunham
48015,US,"Superbly smooth—satiny is really the right word—this luscious Chardonnay pulls together papaya, banana, pineapple and apricot fruit into a seamless, sensuous, full-bodied whole.

48016,US,"As weighty as a Chardonnay, this is a Sauvignon Blanc whose nuances will be killed if you over-chill it. You could even decant it for a while and let it approach room temperature. Dry and rich, it shows savory, complex tiers of pineapples, limes, green apples, sweet golden tobacco, vanilla, white pepper and even a touch of thyme.",Dutton Ranch - Cohen Vineyard,92,20.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dutton Estate

48018,US,"A big Pinot Noir, explosive in cherry and raspberry fruit, but no mere fruit bomb. The tannins are thick and interesting, there's plenty of zesty acidity, and there's something minerally and tangy from the soil.

48021,US,"From the estate vineyard on the Silverado Trail, this is always one of the better Napa Valley Chardonnay bottlings.

Drink now.",Vielles Vignes,92,42.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Signorello
48022,US,"This first vintage of Steven Kent's Ghielmetti Vineyard Cab is worth seeking out to see what Livermore is capable of.

48024,US,"The second vintage of Salida's Tempranillo from Two Coyote vineyard fruit is a wine with tight structure, a wireframe of tannin and mineral supporting beautiful aromatics. A subtle, evocative wine, it instantly explodes with violets, cherries and berries. Then it seems to stop short, though it doesn't fade; rather, it hits a wall. Compact, dense with exotic scents and spices, and great structure. Give it time.",,92,24.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Tempranillo,Salida

48031,US,"Judicious use of darkly toasted Hungarian oak results in a surprisingly sexy, supple wine that's dripping with vanilla and spicy dark plum flavors.

48035,Spain,"This vintage rosado is as good as always, but a bit lower on the quality ladder than previous years.

48038,Spain,"Normally this producer's high-end Sherries are outstanding, but this Amontillado is aggressive and hard, with a clod-like character that starts with molasses on the nose and then turns toward sharpness and bitterness on the palate.

48040,Spain,"This is your quintessential simple quaff among brut cavas. It's clean, lime-tinged and soda-like on the nose, with a correct, no-issues palate that pushes zesty apple along with sweet papaya, mango and banana flavors.

48042,Spain,"Slightly low on kick and bubbles for a blanc de blancs, but the wine's mix of green herb, apple, green banana and melon flavors is good and offers the proper set up to a finish that's citrusy as can be and only slightly pithy.

Clean and lively on the finish, and more than competent as a whole.",Limited Edition,87,17.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
48045,US,"A very good interpretation of Sangiovese. A pretty sharp mouthfeel, but maybe that's to be expected from this high-acid variety. Otherwise, it's nice and dry, with complex cherry, red currant, licorice, leather and sandalwood flavors. Good with spicy beef, pork and veal dishes.",Lola,87,24.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Stave 28
48046,US,"Very good for its complexity, although it's tough and tannic, and the acidity sticks out. The blackberry, currant and cherry flavors are rich and nuanced, but the wine feels hard and sharp.

48049,US,"Made in the modern California Chardonnay style you'll either love or hate. It's enormously extracted in pineapple tart, crème brûlée and honey-drizzled buttered toast flavors, and the acidity is bright and clean. The superrichness would benefit from greater control.",Reserve,87,27.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma-Loeb
48050,Spain,"A heavy, slightly strained wine that has a lot in tow. The nose is smoky, rubbery like an inner tube, and a bit herbal.

Very much on the ripe side, with a full tannic bite.",Lanzaga,87,34.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Telmo Rodríguez
48051,US,"This is dusty, and scented with earth and pine needles. Quite young, it tastes very tart, almost like cranberry juice.

48052,Spain,"Initially it's rugged, but airing reveals black-cherry aromas and dry spice. The palate is crisp and a little sheer by itself, but the call here is that with food it'll be a winner.

48053,US,"Tough in tannins and acidic in the Mayacamas style. Feels hard and dry and earthy. The cherry-berry flavors have a tomatoey edge.

48055,Spain,"Good on the nose, with solid raspberry and nectarine aromas. The palate is spunky and alert, with juicy red-cherry, rhubarb and integrated spice flavors.

48067,US,"Still young and battened down, it brings in grapey red fruits, plenty of barrel toast and some astringent tannins. Aromatically it seems to promise more than it currently delivers in the mouth; perhaps it has simply entered a dumb phase. In any event, give this one a good decanting.",Artisan Blend Red,88,36.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Foundry Vineyards

48078,US,"The Stonetree bottling (one of three single-vineyard Zins from Angel Vine) offers pure strawberry fruit flavor, with medium concentration.

It is soft and finally ripe.",,88,14.0,Southwest France,Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne,,Chardonnay,Domaine du Tariquet
48088,Chile,"Sweet and smoky to start with, and with its mild roasted nose it draws you in. The palate is big, boisterous and generous, but also under control as it delivers pure boysenberry, blackberry and chocolate flavors. Toasty and long, and impressive for an $11 wine.",Natura,88,11.0,Central Valley,,,Carmenère,Emiliana
48089,US,"Good for the winery for making a bone-dry, crisply tart rosé wine that stands for elegance and finesse, which is not the easiest thing to do with a blush Syrah.

48222,Portugal,"From the cooler north-facing Quinta da Gricha, this wine avoided the heat of 2009 to give a rich, also firmly tannic wine, on the dry side, very perfumed.

48229,US,"Lots of acidity in this young wine, maybe more than some wine lovers will be comfortable with.

Yet the flavor explosion is so powerful, you can enjoy it now with utter satisfaction. Erupts in grilled blackberry and cherry, Dr. Pepper cola, bacon, anise, sautéed wild mushroom and smoky sandalwood flavors, leading to a spicy finish that continues for a full minute.

48546,Spain,"Covers all the principle bases via aromas of ripe dark fruit, bacon, spice and herbs. The palate is a bit soft but it's serious, with raspberry, cherry and plum flavors.

48547,US,"With a pleasing array of beeswax, citrus rind, a slight hint of honey and ripe yellow apples, this is firm and surprisingly rich given that the alcohol comes in at just 12.4%. This is from one of the oldest plantings of Pinot Blanc in Oregon. Just 171 cases were made; it's an elegant and delightful effort.",Estate,88,15.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Blanc,David Hill
48548,US,"This Tempranillo is amazingly like a Pinot Noir, with a similar mix of cola, dusty cocoa and sour cherry fruit. Perhaps a bit softer than most Pinots, and absent the vegetal and tomato leaf character that often strikes Oregon wines at this price point; this is a very tasty bottle with a lovely, ripe, round and lightly smoky finish.",,88,24.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Southern Oregon,Tempranillo,David Hill

48551,US,"Almost 15,000 cases are made of this sturdy, solid Willamette Valley Pinot Noir. It's got more muscle and weight than the cheaper stuff from elsewhere, though not the textural interest and nuance of many single vineyard bottlings.

48566,France,"It is sometimes forgotten that Chassagne-Montrachet also produces red wines. Louis Latour's wine presents a fine structure, soft and fresh acidity and ripe, jammy berry flavors.

48576,US,"A rich and sweetly fruity wine with many of the same flavors as Cabernet Sauvignon, except there's something meaty and piney lurking behind the blackberries.

48586,US,"Young, tannic and not yet quite resolved, this wine needs more time in bottle. The components are good—cassis, black cherry, natural acidity, some earthy streaks of bark and astringency.

48591,US,"Always a fine “second” label, the D2 from DeLille is no wimp. Alcohol is listed at a hefty 14.7%, and the blend—55% Merlot/39% Cabernet Sauvignon/4% Cab Franc/2% Petit Verdot—would stand proudly alongside most winery's top wines. This has it all—sappy, tangy fruit, a mix of blue and purple; streaks of herb and leaf; smooth but firm tannins, and a buttery coating over the polished tannins.

Very little Tempranillo is planted in Washington, and most versions draw on the same vineyard sources; this is estate grown and therefore unique.

It's all estate-grown, and the blend is a fascinating combination of Merlot, Cabernet and Malbec, with a dollop of Tinta Cao, Tempranillo and Petit Verdot.

48627,Chile,"On the nose it's sweet, smooth and seductive, but that's where the sweet nothings end.

48628,Chile,"Magenta in color and spritzy, with aromas of chunky red plum, cherry and citrus.

48889,US,"The blend is 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Cabernet Franc and a splash of Merlot. The grapes come from seven specific vineyard blocks, some of which are also sources for Quilceda Creek.

48947,Australia,"Despite the reasonable price tag, this is a very good bottle of Cabernet, the kind that should be poured by the glass at your local steakhouse.

Some leafy herbal flavors compete with the mixed red fruits.",,87,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Primitivo,Angel Vine
48949,Chile,"A little soapy on the nose, with air freshener, cherry candy and soft berry aromas. The palate follows what the nose offers with richness and soft tannins along with blackberry and blueberry flavors.

48950,US,"This is a rather light, surprisingly delicate take on Petite Sirah, with pretty aromas of violets and spice.

48951,Italy,"Here's a Barbera d'Alba that is almost too much of a good thing. The wine is black and dense with inky concentration and thick aromas of smoked bacon, beef jerky and black fruit.

48956,US,"A very good, richly tannic wine that flatters with strong flavors of blackberries, cherries and oak. It may be a little too ripe for its own good, though, as it's pretty jammy.

49079,Chile,"Crusty black-fruit aromas come with tarry notes, a strong whiff of green herbs and olive scents.

49085,France,"This is Bouchard's hallmark Beaune, a blend from different premier cru vineyards. The wine is dense, firm and dominated by dark tannins, which offer good aging potential. The sweet tomato acidity and black berry fruits merge with a noticeable flavor of wood—the combo still needs time to fully balance out.

49090,US,"Great color and dense aromas promise a bit more heft than the wine initially delivers, but it's off to a good start. Inky purple and scented with lead pencil, iron, blackberry and black cherry; flavors follow. The wine spent 18 months in 100% new French oak yet does not smell or taste oaky; its supple and muscular, with the potential to age.

49094,US,"Peju has focused on this variety for many years and has a consistent track record for producing a dry, lush wine.

49104,US,"Dark, rich, tannic and elaborately detailed, this Cab, an inaugural release from the winery, shows dramatic weight and intensity of black currant fruit. It's also rich in smoky new oak. If size alone were everything, it would be a perfect wine. As it is, it overwhelms the palate with power, and it's hard to imagine what to pair with it at the table.

49108,US,"If Syrah can be elegant, this is the poster child. Dark and saturated, this wine is nonetheless light and almost airy, in a good way. The fruit flavors (berries and plums) seem to float above a bed of acid and ripe tannins. There are light streaks of iron and coffee and nuances and suggestions of rock and earth.

49241,Chile,"Smoky smelling and toasty, with peach, melon and cider aromas.

49250,Italy,"Heavy oak use is still evident (this wine is from the 2006 vintage so those toasted notes should be integrated by now) and takes away from the natural integrity of the fruit.

49256,US,"Not showing all that well now, with cola, currant, plum and oak flavors that are a little jammy and direct, and marked by dry tannins.

49507,Spain,"Big, toasty, spicy and loaded with savory berry aromas, smoke and density. The palate is weighty and saturated, but balanced. Flavorwise, it's dealing sweet, jammy, slightly roasted black fruit tastes that are followed by a spicy, toasty, coffee-driven finish. Meaty and ripe; drink now through 2013.",William Selection Crianza,90,27.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tempranillo,Abelis Carthago
49508,US,"Very rich, if a bit of a letdown after the '07. Shows massively concentrated blackberry, cherry and mocha fruit, and overwhelms by its sheer power, with tannins as finely ground as anywhere on earth. But the finish is rather sweet and jammy, and the wine, good as it is, seems best opened now and for the next six years.",Beckstoffer To Kalon,90,135.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alpha Omega
49509,Italy,This is a well shaped and elegant expression of Nero d'Avola with earthy tones of leather and spice backed by bright red fruit and cherry. The wine does a very nice job of showcasing this native grape of Sicily.,Lu Patri,90,,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Nero d'Avola,Baglio del Cristo di Campobello
49510,Spain,"Almond and mineral accents aid the nose on this fuller-bodied Godello that offers polished apple and peach flavors, a refined and complex mouthfeel and a long finish. Delivers quality for the price, so the value quotient is high.",Tempestad,90,21.0,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,,Godello,Bodegas Abanico
49511,US,"This is the first Riesling that Cor has sourced from this important Columbia Gorge vineyard, and it's a gem. Forceful petrol and pine scents lead a powerful, high- acid Riesling that offers citrus rind and tart fruits. Not a floral style; this packs a punch. Very Germanic and fresh.",Underwood Mountain Vineyards,90,16.0,Washington,Columbia Gorge (WA),Washington Other,Riesling,Cor Cellars
49512,US,"Grenache takes the lead position in this dusty, salmon-colored rosé. It looks and tastes French, and has been given a bit more bottle age than most domestic rosés. Fruits run from wild strawberry and watermelon to light citrus, woven together and set against rather firm tannins. A substantial wine with real grip and depth.",,90,23.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Rosé,Doyenne
49513,Australia,"A rare example of really good Australian Merlot, this wine features a supple attack that gradually builds in tannic intensity into a softly dusty finish. Herbal overtones mingle with notes of cassis, mocha and leather.",Brookman,90,45.0,South Australia,Clarendon,,Merlot,Clarendon Hills
49514,US,"Shows the ripe fruit and bright acidity this famous vineyard is known for. Savory in raspberry jam and smoky, caramelized oak, with a fresh, clean mouthfeel. A very nice Pinot Noir to drink now.",Bien Nacido Vineyard Entropy,90,55.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Drake
49515,US,"This is the artist label Merlot; a firm, spicy expression of fruit from the Lewis vineyard. Threads of liquid smoke, spice and coffee are woven into the red fruits—a mix of strawberry, raspberry and cherry flavors. Still young and sharp, it has some heat in the finish. Additional bottle age recommended.",Lewis Vineyard,90,75.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Dunham
49516,Australia,"Full-bodied and creamy in texture, this is a big, plummy Shiraz, made complex by hints of mocha and roasted meat. It's long, lush and berry-laden on the finish. Drink now–2015.",The Protagonist,90,21.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Hesketh
49517,Italy,"As far as Aglianico del Vulture goes, Damaschito is a velvety, more approachable expression of this famously powerful and tannic wine from southern Italy. It delivers aromas of wet river stone, black fruit, cherry and dried currant.",Damaschito,90,,Southern Italy,Aglianico del Vulture,,Aglianico,Lucania
49518,US,"A blend of Marsanne, Chardonnay and Roussanne, this is bright, fruity, with an emphasis on the rind rather than the flesh of citrus and stone fruits. A streak of vanilla runs through the core, and the finish has some stiff, tannic edges. Well-crafted, and a superb food wine.",Jaja,90,15.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,White Blend,Maison Bleue
49519,US,"Clean and well-ripened fruit holds down center court here; tart and tight flavors of currant and berry. It's wrapped in a shell of tannin that is still hard and seeming to hold the wine back. The best guess is to give it some bottle age and let it breathe, and you will be rewarded with a polished and expressive wine.",Estate,90,28.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Petite Verdot,Gifford Hirlinger
49520,US,"Fruit was sourced from the Doc Stewart vineyard, one of the region's oldest, and fermented in American oak. Bright gold in color, it opens with rich scents of buttered nuts, stone fruits, and dusty spices. You will find a lot of flavor for the price, and the wine retains sufficient acidity to brighten up the finish with a lick of minerality.",,90,21.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Grace Cellars
49521,France,"In a firm style, this is a dense wine, its black fruits packed into a solid structure. It has power as well as ripe fruit, with tannins and acidity, and is likely to age for a couple of years.",,90,15.0,Beaujolais,Morgon,,Gamay,Joseph Drouhin
49522,US,"A beautiful Pinot Noir for drinking now. It's delicate and elegant and refined in the mouth, but rich in flavors, offering raspberry tart, red cherry pie with the crust, and dusty Indian spices that finish dry and long, with a touch of funkiness.",,90,39.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Kutch
49523,US,"Rapidly maturing, with some brick coloring and secondary fruit flavors of prune and raisin. Drinking nicely, and quite delicious.

49524,Spain,"Zesty and clean, with pure grapefruit and passion fruit aromas. It's charged up but perfectly balanced, with bright, focused citrus and pineapple flavors. Lemony acidity keeps the finish rolling, then throw in some chive and fresh greens and you have a spot-on Verdejo.",,90,13.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Palacio de Bornos
49525,US,"A delicious Talley Rincon, showing the class of this vineyard.

Drink soon.",Rincon Vineyard,90,58.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Talley
49526,US,"An intriguingly pretty wine with a nose full of violets, Renwood's Grandpère is more feminine in style than its Grandmère, at least in this vintage. It has a spicy, soft finish.",Grandpère,90,40.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Renwood
49527,US,"Pure Merlot, though not labeled as such, this is broadly fruity with a play of strawberry, hard cherry candy, and citrus. The grape sources—Champoux, Klipsun and Bacchus vineyards— are impeccable. Tannins are stiff enough to put a stop to the finish, and to suggest that some further bottle age is called for.",Palisade Red Wine,90,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Soos Creek
49528,Italy,"Aglianico del Vulture is the reigning king of red wines from Basilicata and this hearty expression shows territory-driven aromas of slate and charcoal backed by mature fruit, tobacco and spice. The mouth is greeted by intense flavors of raisin, figs and dried prunes.",Nocte,90,,Southern Italy,Aglianico del Vulture,,Aglianico,Terra dei Re
49529,US,"Rich, evocative, lush with aromas of earth, coffee, chocolate, mocha—scents that suggest excellent evolution ahead.

But all the potential and pieces are there.",,90,40.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Va Piano
49530,Italy,"Bright fruit aromas such as wild berry, red apple, white almond and blueberry come to the foreground.

49532,New Zealand,"Gunn Estate's 2009 is on the green side of things, offering hints of asparagus on the nose before balancing those out nicely with white grapefruit flavors. Despite the herbal overtones, it actually seems richly weighty on the palate before turning citrusy on the finish.",,87,15.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Gunn Estate
49533,US,"Made from the Happy Canyon area, this Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux blend has good blackberry, cherry, currant, cocoa and cedar flavors, and is dry and richly tannic. The main drawback is sharp acidity that would be considered a flaw in most Napa Valley Cabs. Ready now.",Piocho,87,30.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Happy Canyon Vineyard

49535,Australia,"Starts off tighter and less giving than the regular Mort's Block, only gradually displaying its greater potential longevity.

49537,US,"Shows the challenges of the 2008 vintage, which was alternately cool, hot and rainy in the North Coast. The wine is very dry and quite acidic. While it shows an elegant structure, it's a bit lacking in richness, and probably is not ageworthy.",Hein Vineyard - Hayley Vineyard,87,52.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Fulcrum
49538,Italy,"Here's a vintage-dated sweet sparkling wine that opens with a crystalline, luminous appearance and enticing aromas of wildflower, white mineral, honey and stone fruit. The effervescence is tonic and firm and there's a playful touch of bitter almond on the close.",Millesimato Cuvée Platinum,87,14.0,Piedmont,Asti,,Moscato,Gancia
49539,Italy,"This wine is packed tight with plum and blackberry aromas and even a drying touch of Graham cracker. The wine is not too concentrated or rich, which makes it more appropriate with easy, home-cooked meals. On the close, it offers a ton of sweet, bright cherry fruit.",,87,18.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Giacomo Vico
49540,Italy,"Dolcetto San Rocco is a clean and elegant wine with a less obvious aromatic offering of forest berry, blueberry and spice.

49541,US,"Sweetly caramelized, smoky oak, with all of its vanilla and wood sap flavors, dominates this wine, although it does have a considerable framework of raspberries and cherries. Feels a bit one-dimensional, but it's a pretty Pinot Noir, from a good address.",,87,38.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,La Rochelle
49542,Italy,"Here is a distinctive interpretation of Barbera with candy-like aromas of cherry and raspberry followed by sweet spice and fruit cola. The nose is extremely floral and fragrant and might not appeal to everyone, although the mouthfeel—acidic and dense—is very much in line with Barbera.",Solneri,87,35.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti Superiore Nizza,,Barbera,Pescaja
49543,Italy,Tremendous value is offered by this nicely concentrated and intense expression of Barbera.

49545,US,"This 100% Sangiovese has interesting aromatics, with a pine ester high note over the light strawberry-scented fruit.

49546,US,"Grown at a high altitude above Alexander Valley, this Merlot shows dense, hard mountain tannins that lock it down in astringency. The question with such wines always is, will it age? In this case, despite a rich core of cherries and blackberries, it's doubtful. The wine is so unusually tough that the tannins seem likely to outlive the fruit.",Lost Pine,87,65.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Stonestreet
49547,Chile,"If you don't mind a bit of herbal character, this is a nice, easy drinking Syrah with raspberry and cherry aromas and timidity as opposed to a forceful attack. Zesty berry fruit rules the palate, which finishes in round, roasted form. Nice but sort of generic.",,87,8.0,Rapel Valley,,,Syrah,Rayun
49548,US,"Likeable for its extreme dryness and crisp acidity, and the way the citrus fruits and minerals tickle the palate and prepare it for food. It's a great cocktail wine, with lime, Meyer lemon, white peach and floral flavors.",,87,8.0,California,California,California Other,Sauvignon Blanc,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi
49549,US,"A good, polished Pinot for drinking now. It's brisk in acidity and has a hint of green mint, but the raspberry, cherry and cedar flavors are delicious.",,87,50.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Twomey

The result is a rich, elegant wine, with a hint of honeyed sweetness.",,87,20.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Viognier,Zaca Mesa
49552,US,"A lovely, everyday drinking Sauvignon Blanc. It's zesty in acidity, with mouth-cleansing flavors of lemons, limes and oranges. Finishes a little sweet, but not too much. A delight for late afternoon cocktails with little munchies, like puff pastry mushrooms.",,87,14.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Maddalena
49553,Italy,"Here's a very fresh and vinous smelling Barbera d'Asti with raw notes of chewy cherry fruit and bright forest berry.

49554,US,"Quite a nice Sauvignon Blanc, although it could be a tad drier on the finish, as there's a jammy, fruit tart quality. Shows crisp acidity framing ripe lemon, lime, green apple, melon and spice flavors.",,87,19.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Matanzas Creek
49555,New Zealand,"One of NZ's first Sauvignon producers has turned out a commendable wine in 2009, offering classic grassy-herbal aromas and expressive pineapple and herb flavors.

49557,Italy,"Raw fruit aromas of blackberry and wild fruit are followed by subtle tones of natural rubber and spice. The wine is soft and plush in the mouth with fresh acidity and good density to maintain a long, bright aftertaste.",Sopra Berruti,87,,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,,Barbera,L'Armangia
49558,US,"Marked by strong, ripe fruit, this Cab is a bit one-dimensional. It offers waves of blackberries, cherries, raspberries and chocolate, with a rich coating of sweet, smoky oak, and has a soft, melted mouthfeel. Seems at its best now.",Maroon Vineyard,87,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Maroon

49560,Chile,"Rubber and earth aromas lead to a mix of berry fruit scents and a pinch of vinegar. It's firm in the mouth, with cranberry and herbal raspberry flavors.

49563,Italy,"There's a beefy, meaty element on the nose that is not completely masked by the sweet nature of the fruit and cherry aromas also present. The wine's texture is thick and slightly gritty.",Cerretello,84,,Tuscany,Chianti Superiore,,Sangiovese,Pieve de' Pitti

49567,Spain,"This is an unusual white blend from Mallorca that uses the native Premsal grape along with 15% Muscat. It smells a little funky and sweaty, and while the feel is angular the palate isn't bad. Tastes sort of fruitless, with a bit of green melon. O.K. for a weird wine, but it's hollow and short on flavor.",Quíbia,84,15.0,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Mallorca,,White Blend,Ànima Negra
49568,US,"So acidic, it's almost sour, and the cherry and cranberry fruit isn't rich enough to offset that tartness. As a result, it feels unbalanced and uncomfortable.",HMR Estate Vineyard,84,35.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Adelaida

49570,Chile,"Fairly murky and herbal at first, with leafy, muddy aromas. It improves after that, delivering a syrupy dark fruit palate with creaminess, lactic vanilla flavors, blackberry fruit and peppery spice. Big, sweet, herbal and clumsy, but also fruity and generous.",Reserva,84,9.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Carmenère,Luis Felipe Edwards

49572,Spain,"Rustic, flat and chemical at first, with offsetting caramel sweetness to the nose. The palate is big and dark, with herbal, candied flavors and a peppery, creamy finish.

49586,US,"Albariño works in California when it's completely dry and minerally, because the variety's high acidity and citrus flavors make for a crisp, mouthwatering wine.

There is some detectable volatility in the finish.",,87,23.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Edmonds Winery
49591,US,"Lusty and voluptuous are two words that describe this bone-dry Syrah. Heat from high alcohol accentuates the black currant, raisin and pepper flavors, and thick, rich tannins make it a full-bodied partner for beef.

49600,US,"Shows some great flavors of chocolate-infused cassis and plum sauce, with a smoky, cedary edge, and the finish is thoroughly dry despite the fruity richness.

49693,US,"This is Walter Dacon's best effort, a barrel selection from the French oak-aged side lots. It's 100% Syrah with a generous (one third) portion of Boushey grapes. The three Syrahs from Walter Dacon use different barrel regimens, but blend grapes from the same vineyards, and so they tend to share a very similar set of flavors, and lose focus.

49694,Argentina,"Weinert has always pushed the more traditional, less extracted style. And this Bordeaux blend shows a nose of light spice, cinnamon, wet clay and subdued berry fruit. The palate is earthy, with hints of tomato, herbs, raspberry and cocoa. It's a drying wine, with grabby tannins, but it should age well for another few years.

49697,Chile,"Up until now we haven't been real fond of the Oops brand from Chile. However, this Sauvignon Blanc is exactly what we like. It starts with a basic but comfortable blend of citrusy aromas before showing a complete palate consisting of apple, grapefruit, celery and white pepper flavors. A totally solid wine with no gaps.

49698,France,"This firm's top Crozes-Hermitage cuvée is the Domaine Raymond Roure, which sees plenty of new wood in its upbringing, to judge from its somewhat coarse vanilla and cedar notes.

49704,France,"An intriguing wine, that offers ripe sweetness followed by an edgy rustic acidity. Is this a stage in its evolution?

49868,US,"Charbono is a variety that used to be more widely planted. It's always a rustic wine, but it ages forever, and can develop sweet complexities.

49869,South Africa,"Clove, leather and pepper aromas and flavors give this Cabernet a masculine edge.

A lingering finish tops it off.",,87,13.0,Western Cape,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Porcupine Ridge
49870,Spain,"Spearmint, bramble and tomato aromas give this wine a mature bouquet. The palate is wide and shows standard leather, berry and tobacco flavors.

49871,Spain,"A greeting of toasted nuts and toffee is lifted and sweet, and the palate is quite sweet, with orange marmalade and cinnamon-infused syrup flavors. The finish teeters on cloying as it packs a sweet punch, but there's enough acidity to keep it moving along. Best if you like sweet Sherry.",Medium Amontillado,87,13.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,Pedro Romero
49872,US,"Ripe and extracted in blackberry, currant, mocha and oak flavors, this Cab, tasted at the age of 3-plus years, still was freshly sharp and jammy. You might want to cellar it for a few years to let it mellow and knit together.",,87,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Volta

49874,Italy,"This is an extremely mineral-driven Riserva from an 11-acre estate in Castelnuovo Berardenga (the warmer, southern part of Chianti Classico) with aromas of white stone, roof slate and lead pencil.

49883,Spain,"Hard and closed on the nose, but if you dig there's saturated yet generic dark-fruit aromas and a touch of creamy, lactic oak.

49892,France,"Marcillac is one of the more remote French regions located in the hills of the Massif Central.

49927,Spain,"Smells like air freshener and white flowers.

49959,Chile,"Like German or Alsace Rieslings, this Chilean version hints at petrol but falls short, thus the nose is wayward and perfumed.

49965,Portugal,"Aromatic with white flowers, it's rounded, soft and gentle. It misses out on acidity, giving the wine a fat feel. Drink now.",,84,,Tejo,,,Portuguese White,Monte Largo
49966,US,"Dark golden in color, this wine offers nectarine and just-ripe apple. High in acidity, medium in body, it has a trace of sourness on the finish.",The Heritage Collection,84,12.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Viognier,Peirano
49967,US,"This bottling starts with a pretty nose of peach, melon and nectarine. It's more about the crisp, refreshing mouthfeel than anything, and would partner well with lightly seasoned shellfish or soft cheese.",Resistance Willow Creek Farm,84,32.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Rosé,Proulx
49968,Chile,"Blueberry aromas come with an exotic note of cardamom. In the mouth, it feels flat, with rubbery tannins. Flavors of herbal berry and tomato leaf are briny and have a plastic-like taste, while herbal notes of oregano and tomato dominate the finish.",Tama Vineyard Selection,84,15.0,Cachapoal Valley,,,Carmenère,Anakena
49969,Spain,"Melon, peach and vanilla-cookie aromas are simple and easy. This is plump in feel but bland on the tongue. Flavors of stone fruits are modest, while the finish lumbers along and lingers with a touch of peach.",Blanco,84,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Viura-Chardonnay,deAlto Amo
49970,Chile,"Light cherry and raspberry aromas come with a note of apple skins. The feel is plump but midland, with mealy notes. Flavors of cherry and plum are bland, while overall this wine is decent but lacking in personality.",Estate,84,15.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Rosé,Estampa
49971,US,"Smooth-textured, this features a sprinkling of sugar, peachy flavors and a hint of honey. Light in body, attractively fruity and easy to sip.",I=MB2,84,13.0,California,California,California Other,Riesling,Indigené
49972,US,"An easygoing, casual wine with melon and marshmallow flavors and a soft texture. It's cleanly made, light on the palate and almost sweet going down.",,84,11.0,California,California,California Other,Pinot Grigio,Insomnia
49973,Austria,"Soft and pliable in body, it has gentle citrus hints and crisp acidity.",,84,15.0,Niederösterreich,,,Grüner Veltliner,Landhaus Mayer
49974,Portugal,"On the dry side, this is a fruity wine that goes towards raspberries and loganberries. It's fresh and crisp; drink now.",Portuga,84,,Lisboa,,,Rosé,Casa Santos Lima
49975,US,"A restrained version of Tempranillo, it's somewhat lacking in fruit. The wine veers more into the roasted coffee range of things, a deep, heavy roast that some may find astringent without the buoyancy of black fruit.",Lewis Vineyard,84,38.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Tempranillo,Cinnabar
49976,Portugal,"Lightly spicy, this is a soft, off-dry wine. Fresh citrus and apple fruit flavors are perfumed and fruity in the mouth. Not for any aging, it's already a rounded, soft, still fruity wine.",Casa do Lago Branco,84,9.0,Lisboa,,,Portuguese White,DFJ Vinhos
49977,France,"An easy and bright selection, this offers direct aromas and flavors of red currant, underripe strawberry and a touch of banana. The palate is light, with low-intensity flavors and a short, clean finish.",Old Vines,84,11.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Pays d'Oc,,Rosé,Villa des Anges
49978,US,"This Petite opens with pretty floral aromatics, followed by a core of structured, rich red fruit and a soft texture. It veers slightly sour on the finish.",,84,29.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Petite Sirah,Wise Villa
49979,US,"Opening with aromas of barbecued meat, this soft Cab is all about ripe, meaty tannins and smoky oak over any suggestion of fruit, which is hidden among its cedar and tobacco-lined walls.",Peltier Station,84,18.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Peltier
49980,Chile,"Perfumed and floral on the nose, but also spicy and slightly foresty, which is apropos for Syrah. Flavors of black olive, brandied cherry and blackberry are perfectly nice, and the feel is mildly creamy and rich but still pointed. Finishes with toasty notes of pepper, brown sugar and woodspice.",Axel,89,20.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Syrah,La Playa
49981,US,"No questioning the ripeness of this Syrah. It floods the mouth with jammy cherries, blueberries, currants and chocolate, with a peppery edge accented by smoky new oak. A bit soft and obvious in its palate appeal, it's at its best now and for a couple years.",,89,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,La Sirena
49982,France,"Maison Bouachon is an old négociant house based in Gigondas. It's now owned by the Skalli family who is trying to raise the level of the wines. This Côtes-du-Rhône cuvée is a promising effort, boasting plenty of black cherry fruit to go with hints of leather and game. The fruit shows a hint of sur-maturité, yet remains fresh, while the mouthfeel is round yet not unstructured. Drink now–2010, possibly longer.",Les Rabassières,89,17.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Maison Bouachon
49983,US,"The 2005 Byzance now includes roughly 21% Mourvèdre, along with the 57% Grenache and 22% Syrah. Young and tight, it's scented with fresh raspberries and cocoa. The fruit flavors include red currant and spicy cherry as well, and it feels sleek and elegant, though confined. The way the wine spreads out across the palate is encouraging, as are the hints of pepper, herb and stone. Decant before drinking.",Byzance Red Wine,89,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Brian Carter Cellars
49984,US,"From a hot, sandy site in the heart of the Wahluke Slope, this was barrel fermented in neutral oak. The aromas are an inviting mélange of spice, clove, lime and light tropical fruits, and the wine has natural poise and balance. Green apple, lime and peach come into play, along with streaks of butterscotch.",Talcott Vineyard,89,18.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Viognier,Bunnell Family Cellar
49985,Chile,"Your first take on this heavily oaked, natural-yeast Chard is that it's a three-alarm smoke alert. Few, if any, Chilean Chardonnays are this overtly oaky. But the wood is of high quality, and the more time you give it the more you find apple, citrus and spice. Yes, it's still resiny. But the balance and natural character of the wine are very good. Best if you like a New World style with plenty of barrel character.",Wild Ferment,89,21.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Errazuriz
49986,France,"After spending 18 months in oak, this is an unusually cedary Châteauneuf-du-Pape, its stewed fruit, plum pudding and spice flavors covered by a veneer of toast and vanilla. It's full bodied, plushly textured and undeniably appealing in a rather obvious, modern style. Imported by New Castle Imports, Inc.",Boisrenard,89,38.0,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine de Beaurenard
49987,Australia,"Not that much Hunter Shiraz makes it to the U.S. these days, but this bottling from Wyndham Estate is a nice example. It shows rather clean winemaking, with strong vanilla and cedar notes from barrel aging to go alongside blueberry and blackberry fruit. Only mildly tannic, so it's approachable now, but should age through at least 2012.",Black Cluster,89,35.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,Shiraz,Wyndham Estate
49988,US,"Firm and dry in tannins, this Cab needs rich fare to come into its own. A nice steak will negotiate the tight astringency and let the red and black currant flavors emerge into sweetness. Gets better as it warms in the glass, and should age well for six years.",,89,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,X
49989,US,"Another winner from Castle Rock, this is a lovely Merlot, pure and true, with a luscious core of soft, sweet cherry candy fruit. Medium weight, excellent balance, exceptional clarity and freshness for the price.",,88,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Castle Rock
49990,US,"Clean, lean and elegant, with mineral-infused citrus and green apple flavors set off by crisp acidity. There's no oak, but somehow the wine has a vanilla and honey richness.",Del Lago,88,20.0,California,Clear Lake,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Chardonnay,Ceago Vinegarden
49991,Argentina,"More clean and relaxed than Chalten's 2006 Gran Reserva, this reserve-level Malbec shows generous red-fruit aromas in front of standard but totally pleasant blackberry, spice and chocolate flavors. Nicely balanced, with firm acidity, mellow but present tannins, and a medium-long, slightly oaky finish. Classic Argentine Malbec from Neuquén in Patagonia.",Reserva,88,15.0,Other,Neuquén,,Malbec,Chaltén
49992,US,"The label shows a 1936 Chevy one ton flatbed truck; the same truck is parked out in front of the winery. This nonvintage blend is roughly two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon; most of the rest is Merlot, and Malbec fills in the final chunk. Soft, ready to drink and gently fruity, this all-purpose red will go with anything from hot dogs to burgers to pizza.",36 Red,88,14.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Chandler Reach
49993,France,"A rich wine, full of ripe red plums and sweet acidity. There is also a denser character, made up of concentrated tannins, dark wood and a structure that needs time to develop. In the end, the juicy acidity just bursts out of the glass, leaving a fresh, red berry fruit aftertaste.",,88,70.0,Burgundy,Volnay,,Pinot Noir,Chanson Père et Fils
49994,France,"Alain Dugas, who is also the winemaker at Château La Nerthe in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, runs this estate, and he has turned out a concentrated, dark-fruited wine in the 2004 vintage. Black cherry and plum pick up hints of tree bark, coffee and earth on the firmly tannic finish. Drink 2010–2015.",Massif d'Uchaux,88,20.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône Villages,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine de la Renjarde
49995,US,"Very dry, tartly acidic and lemony, almost like a Sauvignon Blanc, but with richer notes of pineapple cream. Super-drinkable, and the low alcohol won't overpower a delicate dish, like sole in a garlicky butter sauce.",,88,18.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Lorena Garcia
49996,US,"A pure varietal Roussanne, the 2007 La Vie Douce is the best of the first releases from this new Washington winery. Scents are flush with honey, sweet pineapple and apricot, and the substantial residual sugar (4.6%) is somewhat masked by acids. This is a seductive, graceful wine that would be spectacular with a peach or pineapple dessert, as long as it is not overly sweet.",La Vie Douce,88,23.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Roussanne,Maison Bleue
49997,France,"The wine has firm tannins, with a layer of wood surrounding the red plum and intense acidity. At this stage, it remains tannic, needing a few more months to open up, but it will then offer the round softness of Savigny.",Aux Fourches,88,,Burgundy,Savigny-lès-Beaune,,Pinot Noir,Maison Champy
