87586,US,"It's unheard of for a winery to hold back a Sangiovese for more than four years before releasing it, but DeLorimier did. It's done the wine well, allowing it to soften and mellow.

87938,US,"Hard in tannins and acidic, this is a pretty unrelieved wine when it comes to palate enjoyment. It's not offering much, but there is a big heart of blackberries and dark, ripe cherries, leading to speculations about ageability.

Scott Cellars
87943,US,"Stiff and tannic, this dark and steely Syrah is scented with loam, lead pencil and blackberries. The blackberry fruit is matched, but not over-matched, with darker notes of tar, coffee and bitter chocolate.

87945,Australia,"This superripe Grenache is supple and mouthfilling, coating the palate with an array of chocolate and cola richness. Some peppery, cinnamon-like aromas add a touch of nuance, but overall the impression is of slipping into an overstuffed chair that's comfortable at first but lacks the support for a long-term stay.",Prodigal,88,30.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Grenache,Kilikanoon
87946,US,"There's a hint of smoke throughout the nose and palate that adds a layer of complexity to this sweet, pretty Riesling.

87948,US,"This is oily and ripe, with plenty of butter, butterscotch and toasty new oak. What elevates it, as with all Pacific Northwest Chardonnays, is the extra acidity, that provides a foundation of support under the lush fruit and generous new oak.

87949,US,"A chewy, high-acid take on Merlot, with a strong herbal note to the tannins. It might almost pass for Carmenère.

87957,US,"The oak is strong, giving a toasty, charcoal aroma and tannic texture, and the acids and grape tannins likewise contribute to making this wine rather aloof.

88036,US,"Very dry and high in acidity, with a tart, almost sour mouthfeel, but that's good. It's like the refreshing, palate-stimulating quality of a sour red cherry candy.

88123,Chile,"Cola, sarsaparilla and fine rubber give this wine a dark personality that's infused with brighter raspberry and black cherry.

88124,US,"BlackTongue has some of the same umami-soaked character as the nearby Boushey vineyard Syrahs, with perhaps more earth, smoke, tar and licorice, and a little less funk and composty aromas. A stylistic note—this is a very dry Syrah, deep, compact, layered with black fruit flavors, cassis and very dry tannins.",BlackTongue,90,30.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Stevens
88125,Chile,"A rock-solid wine with bright currant, berry and rooty, cola-infused aromas. The mouthfeel is excellent and integrated, with earthy, savory, spicy flavors of blackberry, cherry and tea.

The pineapple, raspberry and vanilla flavors are delicious.",Brut,90,19.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Champagne Blend,Scharffenberger
88127,US,"A very nice Chardonnay for this price.

88130,US,"A little too soft in both acidity and tannins to have perfect structure, but it's fine enough, and the flavors certainly are complex and compelling.

88131,Italy,"The Asili cru is always a top performer, and although this vintage from acclaimed winemaker Michele Chiarlo is excellent, it's not quite outstanding. There's a hint of apple skin or orange zest that imparts a buoyant and immediate disposition.

88132,US,"A surefire success in all the Milbrandt vineyard holdings, Syrah shows stuffing and spine here. It's firm, herbal and earthy, with a lightly funky aspect.

88138,US,"You'll find beautiful, lush, complex, fruit-driven aromas here, as with all the L'Ecole white wines.

88144,US,"So ripe and fruity, it's almost too much of a good thing. Detonates on the palate with blasts of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, cola and cinnamon spice.

88145,US,"Dry and clean, but this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend shows a surprising sharpness and hardness for a wine from this vintage, at this age.

88146,US,"Very dry, very tannic and austere, this southern Rhône-style blend isn't offering much now beyond the astringency.

88211,Chile,"A classic Chilean blend that's higher in acid and red fruit character than most icon wines, but in a way that's good. The nose is composed, with a slight medicinal quality and some candied red fruit. Flavors of dried cassis, tobacco and plums are typical of “real” Chile, while a controlled confidence takes over late. Could improve over the next three years.",Le Dix de Los Vascos,89,50.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Blend,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite)

Drink now–2012.",Sexton Vineyard,89,30.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,Chardonnay,Giant Steps
88213,Argentina,"Dry and lightly balsamic on the nose, with solid fruit aromas that show a marginal level of stem. The palate is stacked with black cherry and blueberry along with full tannins.

88220,Austria,"Furmint is essentially an Hungarian grape, but the Hungarian line is not far from Heidi Schröck's winery in Rust, and there is a long historical connection between the two countries.

88225,Argentina,"A three-grape blend of Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot. The nose is rich and mossy, with vanilla and baked fruit aromas.

Not going anywhere.",Owl Hill Vineyard Estate Bottled,84,22.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Frick
88477,US,"There are some tough, astringent tannins in this wine that make it harsh on the palate and bitter on the finish. The actual flavors are of cola, raisins and black currants. Doesn't seem like an ager.",Diamond Reserve,84,37.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Petite Sirah,Harmony Cellars
88478,Italy,Here's an easy Cabernet Franc/Cabernet Sauvignon with light concentration and lean consistency. This organic wine offers fresh aromas of black fruit and exotic spice and tastes tonic and acidic on the palate. Pair it with creamy pasta dishes.,,84,13.0,Veneto,Piave,,Cabernet,Pizzolato
88479,US,"Simple and unfussy, the kind of wine people quaff everyday all over the world without analysis. It's dry and light-bodied, with flavors of berries, herbs and tobacco.",,84,20.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Parkers Estate
88480,Spain,"Vanilla and a lot of oak blend with baked apple on the nose, while the palate is grabby and resiny, with drawn, oak-heavy flavors of baked apple and vanilla. For a winery that rarely misses with its red wines, this is one that's o.k. but probably not worth the money.",Organza,84,28.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,White Blend,Sierra Cantabria
88481,US,"Aromas hint at unusual scents such as rubber and fowl, but in the mouth it's a straightforward, rather herbal Pinot Noir, with light and quickly fading strawberry and cherry fruit flavors.",Reserve,84,28.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Silvan Ridge
88482,US,"At four-plus years, this is a harsh wine, tough in tannins and over-oaked. You'll find blackberry, cherry, currant and herb flavors and a dry, hard finish. Okay for everyday fare, but pricey for what you get.",All In Claret,84,45.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Murphy-Goode
88483,US,"This young, fresh, fruity Zin tastes like raspberry and cherry jam and bubblegum. It's an effusively easy wine, and very dry and soft. Okay with everyday fare like ham or a juicy cheeseburger.",Liar's Dice,84,21.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Murphy-Goode

88485,Spain,"Opens with generic berry aromas and a slight candied, gaseous undercurrent. The palate is modest and lean, with decent raspberry flavors and not a whole lot of follow through. Basic and a bit rubbery.",Tinto,84,14.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Viña Vilano
88486,France,"A medium-bodied blend of Grenache Blanc, Bourboulenc, Ugni Blanc and Roussanne, this simple white from the Perrin family of Beaucastel offers fruity notes of melon and citrus that finish crisp and clean.",,84,9.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Luberon,,Rhône-style White Blend,La Vieille Ferme
88487,US,"Here's a vigorously tannic, dry and rasping red wine. It has briary, somewhat raisiny flavors of blackberries and currants. The tannins hit bigtime on the finish, making it astringent. Doesn't seem likely to age.",,84,30.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Petite Verdot,Opaque
88488,Spain,"Begins with a sweet marshmallow creaminess on the nose, which is followed by a firm, tanninc palate with snappy cherry and raspberry flavors. Clean and easy to understand, but in the end it's a very regular wine.",Tinto,84,13.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Pago del Vostal
88489,Italy,"This bottle has much of the history of Italian winemaking inside. You remember the hay-wrapped flasks at the local trattoria? This is a modern interpretation with simple aromas of cherry, wild berry and wet earth. It would pair beautifully with pizza or pasta thanks to the fresh acidity and lean mouthfeel.",,84,10.0,Tuscany,Chianti,,Sangiovese,Ruffino
88490,US,"Too green and acidic for pleasure, with mint dominating the rather modest cherries and red currants. Sleek and elegant in the mouth, but the absence of richness hurts the score.",Rodgers Creek,84,42.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Picket Fence
88491,US,"This 100% Cabernet tastes way too oaky. Vanilla cream and caramel dominate the blackberries and black currants, giving it a woody sweetness. The question is, will it age out? The classic answer is that a wine that tastes unbalanced when young most likely always will.",Kenefick Ranch,84,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Quivet Cellars

88493,France,"A wine that is lean and angular, austere, the fruit dominated by very dry tannins. It misses weight with the licorice, meaty flavors and a hard-edged structure.",,84,26.0,Bordeaux,Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Ramafort
88494,US,"First taste was excellent, as the wine entered the mouth with round, ripe red fruit and a hint of spice.

88495,Portugal,"The wine tastes young, its fruits and wood characters not quite integrated. But it has a good light touch of redcurrants and blackberries to go with the acidity. The wood gives dry tannins and a firm structure.",Pedras do Monte,84,8.0,Terras do Sado,,,Castelão,DFJ Vinhos
88496,Italy,"This Dolcetto offers a thick nose rich with warm tones of leather, pipe tobacco, dark chocolate and mature blueberry. There's a tiny element of horse or wet animal but it doesn't distract too badly from the overall picture.",,84,15.0,Piedmont,Langhe,,Dolcetto,Anna Maria Abbona
88497,Spain,"Briar and rhubarb aromas suggest stemminess, but the palate is fairly clean and clear, with tight, rubbery tannins supporting red fruit flavors of cherry and plum. Short, rubbery and unexceptional, but good enough despite a whiff of green that's probably due to the Cabernet in the wine.",Rojo,84,9.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Basico

88499,US,"Somewhat bitter and ragged in mouthfeel, with a raisinskin sharpness that interferes with the pleasure of the dry, rich blackberries and chocolate. Turns raisiny on the finish, and at its best now.",Bon Vivant,84,42.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hunt Cellars
88500,Chile,"Angular on the nose, with earthy, semisharp red fruit aromas that are undoubtedly Pinot-related.

Dry, toasty and endearing on the finish.",Alpha,88,24.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Pinot Noir,Montes

88502,Chile,"Earthy and warm, and very much requiring time to open and show itself. So don't freak out if upon opening it's tight, funky and odd. Later it will become a serious wine with cheek-pounding berry fruit, a rock-hard structure and power all the way through the toasty finish. Don't be looking for refined elegance or you'll be left at the station. Drink now through 2013.",Cordillera Reserva Privada Cariñena-Merlot-Shiraz,88,23.0,Central Valley,,,Red Blend,Miguel Torres
88503,Chile,"Earthy and damp at first, then come cool cola and olive aromas that announce the Carmenère in the lead. The palate is rugged but true, with smoothness from the Merlot and then full olive and herbal flavors. Stays on track from front to back; there isn't a lot of variation to the wine.",Cordillera Reserva Privada Carmenère-Merlot-Petit Verdot,88,23.0,Central Valley,,,Red Blend,Miguel Torres
88504,US,"A rich, balanced and lovely Sauvignon Blanc. Fermented in stainless steel tanks, it's clean and crisp, with vibrant flavors of lemons, limes, vanilla, honeysuckle and spice. Sur lies aging adds a desirable texture of cream.",Jardine,88,16.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Vina Robles

88506,US,"Not much oak is evident in this polished Chardonnay. What stars is fruit, all pineapples, pears, tangerines, green apples and papayas, and the acidity that makes it all bright and clean. Great with pasta in a butter sauce with garlic and pepper.",,88,18.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Egret
88507,Australia,"This Chardonnay from a Shiraz specialist features ample weight without any oak treatment, leaving the bold pear, melon and pineapple flavors unblemished. It's crisp enough to cleanse the palate, yet plump enough to pair with a variety of dishes.",Unoaked,88,15.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Chardonnay,Elderton
88508,Chile,"The yellow color and doughnutty, honeyed aromas give it away: this is barrel-fermented, Bordeaux-style SB. The nose is barrique heaven, but the vanilla and resin qualities are stylish. Creamy but balanced in the mouth, with flavors of oak, vanilla, spice, honey and baked apple. Smooth stuff but very oaky, and not for everyone.",Hacienda Araucano Humo Blanco,88,22.0,Lolol Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,François Lurton
88509,France,"An interesting blend of 50% Chardonnay, 40% Roussanne and 10% Sauvignon Blanc, this is a lively and very aromatic white with scents of pretty pink florals like sweet pea and roses, ripe peach, mango and melon. The same carries through to the palate, which shows great roundness in the middle without being too flabby. The finish is clean but lengthy. Delish.",1 C,88,15.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Vin de Pays de L'Herault,,White Blend,Chateau Capion

88511,US,"Albariño is one of those new white wine varieties that's creating such interest.

88512,New Zealand,"Zesty and refreshing, the 2007 Coddington comes across as just slightly narrower and tarter than its stablemates. Hints of toast and vanilla accent bright starfruit and apple flavors.",Coddington,88,42.0,Kumeu,,,Chardonnay,Kumeu River
88513,Argentina,"Strong and extracted, and needing a few minutes to settle. The palate is concentrated, dark and chewy, with ripe berry flavors that hint at being medicinal and raisiny but don't fully go there. While this is nothing earth-shattering, for $12 it's complete and should offer mass appeal.",,88,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lamadrid
88514,US,"Extravagantly rich, showcasing ripe, forward flavors of cherries baked into a pie, Dr. Pepper cola and sweet, smoky oak, with all kinds of peppery Indian spices.

88515,Chile,"A huge improvement from the overoaked, flawed 2007 Sibaris. This is still toasty and resiny like most Chilean Chards, but it's also smooth and thorough in the mouth, with orange, melon, vanilla and toast flavors. Unfolds nicely on the finish; very good for Maipo Chardonnay and, as stated, a far more balanced wine than the previous vintage.",Sibaris Reserva Especial,88,15.0,Maipo Valley,,,Chardonnay,Undurraga
88516,France,"Broad, ripe, full in the mouth, packed with soft white fruits and an open structure. There is some wood, the vanilla melding easily into the fruit. For drinking now.",Les Chaniots Premier Cru,88,27.0,Burgundy,Montagny,,Chardonnay,Vignerons de Buxy

88519,Italy,"This is a fresh and luminous blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Cortese that really hits home thanks to its frank approach and pristine aromas of citrus, stone fruit and honey.

88520,Argentina,"Earthy, spicy and rich on the nose, but then quite gritty, tough and tannic on the palate.

88521,New Zealand,"Lovely aromas of toasted nuts and lemon curd are backed up on the palate by hints of melon and citrus.

88522,France,"Bouchard's village wines express the nature of each place well. None more so than this firmly tannic Nuits-Saint-Georges.

88526,France,"A wine that reflects the relative lightness of the reds in this vintage. It has a layer of tannins, but they don't suggest aging; they are more a base for the attractive raspberry and red plum flavor, freshened by the acidity.",Marconnets Premier Cru,88,50.0,Burgundy,Beaune,,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils

88529,France,"The Domaines Ott Chateau de Selle is a breed apart, with little of the effusive red fruit that we typically associate with Provence Rosés.

88532,US,"A secret of Santa Rita Hills is how kind the terroir is to Pinot Grigio AKA Pinot Gris.

88533,Spain,"Nice wine with standard Rioja aromas of raspberry, vanilla, licorice and dill. The palate has life and kick due to protruding acidity, while the flavor profile is based on snappy, high-toned plum and red berry. Softer on the finish, where butter and vanilla notes rise up. Drinkable now but will hold for another few years.",Reserva,88,22.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Castillo Labastida

88536,Australia,"Probably because of its youth, this wine comes out of the chute a little tight and rubbery; try giving it a quick decanting, or swirl it aggressively in the glass to bring out the underlying cola and blackberry aromas and flavors. Turns slightly dusty on the finish, suggesting at least a few years' worth of drinkability.",d'Arrys Original,88,19.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz-Grenache,D'Arenberg

88538,US,"Folin's Misceo is a blend of Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre, all estate-grown.

88542,US,"Here is an affordably priced Oregon Pinot that nonetheless spent 15 months in French oak, 20% new.

A great choice for near-term drinking.",,88,20.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Illahe
88543,France,"Another wacky Riesling from Marc Kreydenweiss, this one somehow works.

Serve this unusual wine by itself or with Indian fare.",Le Château Kastelberg Grand Cru,88,105.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Marc Kreydenweiss
88544,US,"Made the way Pinot Grigio should be. Bone dry and zesty in acidity, it has citrus, mineral and floral flavors that finish with a scour of peppery spice.

The wine makes an extremely clean, fresh and vibrant impact in the mouth.",Belguardo,88,17.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Vermentino,Mazzei
88546,US,"Aims for the New Zealand style, and largely gets it right. It's a bone-dry, acidic wine, with a steely minerality and flavors of tart citrus fruits, like lemons, limes and grapefruits. This minimalist approach is sorely welcome in the lineup of California whites.",,88,15.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Justin

88549,US,"Warmly sensuous in the mouth, this gentle and attractive Pinot Noir offers soft fruit, a mix of berries and plums, that slides gracefully across the palate.

88551,US,"Organically grown and sourced from the Dundee Hills AVA, this is from the lighter vintage of 2007. It's balanced and ripe enough, but feels a little thin.

88552,US,"Dry, tart and citrusy. Offers streamlined flavors of lemons, limes, tannic herb tea and minerals, with oak and lees adding much-needed richness.

88553,US,"A quick sniff and you're converted to this cool, refreshing white wine. The aromas carry the promise of citrus rind and sea salt; that tangy character livens up the cool fruit flavors also.

88749,US,"Shows the dark color, full-bodied mouthfeel and big tannins of a good Petite Sirah, as well as massive blackberry, currant, mushu plum sauce and pepper steak flavors.

88754,Australia,"This is an intriguing wine that the winery made “naturally,” with indigenous yeasts, no additions and no filtration.

89028,Italy,"Here's a newly released Barolo that appears older than it actually is.

89129,Argentina,"An extracted, full-bodied style of Malbec with blackberry aromas, density, meatiness and heft.

89148,US,"Anywhere but in Oregon, this could be labeled Pinot Noir, which makes up 80% of the blend; the rest is Zinfandel. It's a combination that makes sense in the Columbia Gorge. The Pinot is more earthy and tannic than in the Willamette Valley, and the Zin lighter than you find in California.

89158,US,"Two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other Bordeaux grapes filling in the rest. Though this 2006 vintage was held back for some time to allow for extra bottle age, this is still a hard, tannic wine that requires decanting.

89308,Spain,"Aromas of canned peaches and apricots are about all one can pull from the bouquet.

89310,Italy,"From the Vigneto Nervo cru of Barbaresco, this well-concentrated wine delivers notes of dark spice, leather, tobacco, mesquite wood and oak. The natural aromas associated with Nebbiolo are still buried, so give this wine time to unwind with a few more years of cellar aging. In the mouth, it shows soft, meaty fruit with a smooth, velvety texture.",Vigneto Nervo,89,49.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Pertinace
89311,Italy,"Black spice, root beer, tar and a touch of smoke are backed by prune, plum and dried currants.

89312,Italy,There's a very ripe element that emerges as jammy blackberry and black currant on the generous bouquet of this lively wine.

89313,Chile,"Pithy and peachy on the nose, and not nearly as zesty smelling as it is in the mouth, where angular, crisp acids push flavors of citrus and passionfruit.

89314,Italy,"The Rizzi family of Barbaresco does amazing work with its specific vineyard crus. One of its best sites is the Fondetta vineyard, although this vintage seems more nervous and raw than in past years.

You'll also get bright fruit and lemon zest on the close.",Nervo Fondetta,89,49.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Rizzi
89315,Italy,"Here is a tight and polished Barolo with a touch of ripe fruit surrounded by leather, black pepper, cola, pressed violets and tar.

89316,US,"A nice interpretation of this variety, and one of the best from Santa Barbara County ever. It's bone dry, big in tannins, full-bodied and juicy, in the way of a young Petite Sirah, with blackberry, currant, cola and cedar flavors. Shows real finesse, in a wine that can often be awkward. Now–2015.",,89,28.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Petite Sirah,Tercero
89317,Italy,"Here's a straightforward but elegant expression of Nebbiolo that ages two years in oak to secure aromas of spice, cola, root beer and leather behind fruity tones of dried blueberries and currants.

89319,Italy,Barolo Roere presents charred notes of charcoal or campfire that will relax with time but that mask some of the wine's natural fruit at this young age.

89320,US,"Young and fruity, offering an explosion of jammy cherries, blackberries and currants. Oak adds a framework of wood tannins that join grapeskin tannins to provide astringency and bite.

89326,US,"Pure Merlot, from the Red Mountain vineyard, this displays that AVA's stiff, hard-edged tannins, keeping the fruit pinned down into a compact core.

89330,Italy,"This is not your standard Moscato d'Asti.

89331,US,"Don't confuse this with the winery's regular Riesling, which is off-dry. This is their dry bottling, and it's a superior wine. Shows vital, crisp acidity that makes the mouth water, then follows up with rich citrus, green apple, Asian pear and peppery spice flavors that are tantalizing and complex.

89334,Italy,Here's an up-and-coming Langhe producer who has already made a big splash with the Italian wine press. Valgrande is the estate's most traditional Barbaresco aged in big oak casks.

89336,US,"Hard to appreciate this pricey blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Malbec right now, it's so sharp and tannic and jammy. The big question is whether or not it will age. The signs are there.

89350,Spain,"Smells like a kirsch liqueur on the bouquet. The palate, somewhat surprisingly, is much sharper than the nose, with tangy, zesty flavors of red fruits that some might adore and others will label too thin and sour.

89489,Argentina,"Pencil lead and rubbery, mature berry aromas open this wine. The palate is driven by energetic, pounding tannins and flavors of black cherry and tomato, which become more prominent as the tannins and acid rebound.

A multi-clone blend (hence the name) with high, cool-climate acidity and aged in 100% new oak, it's still young, fresh and tight. The astringency throws a cloak over the raspberries, cherries, rosehip tea and Indian spice flavors, which reveal themselves only reluctantly.

Shows concentrated flavors of red and black sour cherry candy, red currants, coffee, dried herbs, anise and sandalwood, wrapped into gorgeously soft, refined tannins. Very fine and complex, and will age well. 2012–2018.",St. Eden,94,275.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,BOND
89663,Italy,"Thanks to its excellent quality and universal appeal, you can count on Tignanello to make an excellent impression with any elegant meal. Based on Sangiovese, with a small percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine delivers an interesting power play that pits cherry fruit against vibrant spice. It is tight and firm in the mouth with a slightly sweet or soft note on the close.",Tignanello,94,95.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Marchesi Antinori
89664,Austria,"One of Austria's most successful Pinot Noirs, exhibiting both the wild cherry and jammy red berry fruits of the grape and also impressive Burgundian tannic structure.

89665,US,"Quite a noble, interesting wine that bears comparing with the best of Napa Valley. It's bone dry, with softly dusty tannins backed with a firm hit of clean acidity. The flavors are somewhat herbal, with a sage and tobacco edge to the blackberries, dark chocolate and graphite. Feels classy and important, but young. Better after 2012.",Pickberry Vineyards,94,50.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,Ravenswood
89666,France,"Despite the 100% new wood, this wine (GC stands for Grand Cru) is beautifully restrained. It has such delicious fruit and the ripest of tannins, pierced with the wood flavors, but never dominated by them. It is obviously a wine for aging, still bursting with fresh fruit and acidity.",GC,94,135.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Château du Cèdre
89667,US,"The Poet's Leap Riesling continues its string of outstanding vintages, once again exceptionally concentrated and complex. The high-acid 2008 vintage adds extra juicy vibrancy to the fruit, giving the wine an impression of dryness (though it is a bit over 1% residual sugar) and a dense, layered fruit component. A mix of old vine and German clones, this is a superb effort.",,94,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Riesling,Poet's Leap
89668,Austria,"A highly perfumed wine from old vines, aged for 24 months in wood. The tannins are dusty, with wood very present but not overwhelming the fruit. It is rich and structured, but also sophisticated and elegant, with final ripe black fruits showing well.",Dürrau Cuvée,94,,Burgenland,,,Blaufränkisch,Weninger
89669,US,"This big, young Pinot should have been held back before release, because it's really tannic and primary now, making its future hard to evaluate. However, it seems a likely cellar candidate. It's fresh in acids and clearly has a pedigree of terroir, showing mineral-infused raspberries, cherries, rhubarbs, wild strawberries, and pomegranates, accented with rich, smoky oak. The texture is pure silk, and the finish is firmly dry. Give it until 2012, at the very least.",Bill and Joan's Special Selection,94,75.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,W.H. Smith

Finishes sweet and chocolaty; could use a bit more structure and spine.",Reserva,86,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Bodega Norton

89673,Spain,"Nice violet and minerally aromas mix with sweet berry scents, and right then you know you have a competent, correct Garnacha on your hands.

89674,Spain,"Hard and roasted on the nose, with molasses, leather and other less-than-fruity aromas. It's narrow and clampy in the mouth, with herbal, distant flavors of peppery red fruits.

89681,Italy,"You can see the direction Giuseppe Lonardi wanted to take this 50-50 blend of air-dried Corvina grapes and Cabernet Franc: The goal was to make a bold, modern, super-Venetian wine. Instead, the fruit is a tad too ripe and jammy to be balanced and the wine tastes thick, chewy and slightly tannic on the close.",Privilegia,86,20.0,Veneto,Veronese,,Red Blend,Giuseppe Lonardi
89682,US,"A négociant wine, sharp and spicy, with vivid acidity and some real punch in the midpalate. The flavors suggest thistle and fern – real Northwest fare – rather than riper fruit. It sets up well in the mouth and despite alcohol listed at just 12.5%, has good presence and power.",,86,18.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Chardonnay,Hedgeline
89683,US,"There's not much Sauvignon Blanc grown in this cool region of the Russian River Valley, which makes this bottling a curiosity.

89685,US,"Brown spices around sour cherry fruit flavors roll through the midpalate; then the wine turns a bit thin and hard.

89690,Spain,"Peach and melon aromas are inviting and clean. Very juicy and juice-like in the mouth, probably more so than I can remember for this wine.

Like most RDDs, it's intense and jammy in the mouth, with concentration and flavors of raspberry, tomato, salad dressing and even chocolate.

89928,US,"This is a very big, powerfully extracted Pinot Noir. It is not currently showing much varietal character. Feels like it was made by someone who knows how to make Cabernet, and brings that mindset to Pinot. The wine is full-bodied, thick, heavy and enormously concentrated in raspberries and cherries. Could change over time, but there's not much point in aging it.",,86,46.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Stephen & Walker

89930,US,"Marred by a green peppercorn unripeness that makes the tannins especially difficult and dry. Hard to fall in love with, despite some good black cherry, plum and cola flavors. The chilly vintage seems to have worked against this wine.",,86,50.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,La Crema
89931,Australia,"Tannic, crisp and borderline unfriendly when tasted on its own, this is a firmly structured, berry-and-earth-inflected dry red that should be paired with rare steaks or burgers in order for it to shine.",,86,20.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Sangiovese,Kangarilla Road
89932,France,"Fresh apple, green grass, dandelion and a touch of soft smoke emanate from the glass, transitioning to flavors of gingered peach and spicy orange on the palate. Medium weight and well structured with nice complexity and evolution. Drink now.",,86,11.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Vin de Pays d'Oc,,Chardonnay,Les Jamelles

89934,US,"This very strongly flavored Cabernet isn't showing much subtlety. It offers a blast of ripe blackberries and black currants, with notes of dark chocolate and sweet smoky notes from oak.

89935,Spain,"The first act of dried spices and light, dusty red fruit aromas is honest and subdued.

Standard but hinting at elegant.",Crianza,86,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,El Coto
89936,US,"Dry, full-bodied and tannic, this twin-county blend has Lifesaver candy flavors of blackberries and cherries.

89939,Italy,"This easygoing blend of Merlot and other grapes that are native to Verona delivers bright cherry flavors with blueberry and white almond.

89942,Argentina,"Floral aromas lead the show, backed by meatiness, minerality and wild sage and thyme aromas. The palate is fresh and young, with edgy but saturated plum and raspberry flavors.

89944,Chile,"Earthy and foresty on the nose, with balsam wood aromas that go well with hints of grilled meats and spice.

89947,US,"Good and rich, but a bit ungainly. Sharpness makes it tart, and the oak stands out, shoving the cherry, currant, plum and cola flavors aside.

89958,US,"The underlying wine is very good, showing brisk acidity, a cool-climate minerality and long hangtime, ripe flavors of pineapples, crisp green apples, mangoes and limes.

Delicious and compelling, and a perfect pairing with your best grilled meats.",Dickerson Single Vineyard,94,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Zinfandel,Ravenswood
89975,US,"Very dark, dramatic, opulent, but young. Opens with brooding aromas of black currants, cassis and spices, and turns dense in tannins in the mouth.

The release date is Spring 2010.",Pluribus,94,275.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,BOND
89976,US,"The first thing you notice is the complexity of flavor, carrying waves of wild forest raspberries and cherries, framboise and other liqueury, extracted tastes, sprinkled with rose petal, Dr. Pepper cola and exotic spices, and rounded off with smoky sandalwood. Then the tannins and acids kick in, emphasizing extreme dryness. There are dozens of Pinot Noirs that are more drinkable now, but this is such an interesting interpretation that it deserves a place in your cellar.

89978,US,"The structure and pedigree of this fine wine are immediately apparent. It hits the mouth with a wonderful balance of ripe fruit, fine tannins, firm acidity and perfectly integrated oak.

89981,US,"The vintage was very kind to Chardonnay, and the balance shows in the fantastically ripe, exotic pineapple tart, lemondrop candy, buttered toast, sandalwood and sweet, dusty spice flavors of this immaculately dry, crisp wine. It's strong and impressive now, and not particularly subtle, but should have a narrow window of near perfection. 2011–2013.",Rochioli-Allen Vineyards,94,41.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell

89987,US,"Starts with a beautiful ruby color that's so pretty and gleaming. Appeals right away for its rich, attractive sour cherry candy, vanilla and anise aromas and flavors that are well-integrated with smoky oak.

89988,US,"Shows classic Oakville tannins that are big, ripe, and intricate, but hard, entirely opposite to the softness of the modern cult style. The fruit suggests blackberries and cassis, enriched with smoky-sweet, spicy oak. It's a beautifully structured, dry and elegant 100% Cabernet, but it's too tannic for full enjoyment now. Better 2012–2016.",John C. Sullenger Vineyard,93,90.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Nickel & Nickel
89989,Austria,"If you want power and concentration, look no further.

89990,Australia,"The Dutschke style favors plenty of richness and ripeness, and the 2006 St. Jakobi wears it extremely well. Aromas of chocolate, cinnamon and plum pudding accurately presage the flavors, and the wine is correspondingly full and lush.

89991,France,"Harvested in November 2007, this is sweet wine from the Madiran region of Gascony.

89992,Australia,"The wine is a bit peppery upfront, its bold blueberry and blackberry fruit marked by anise shadings. Medium to full in body, the texture is rich and velvety, with some dusty tannins on the finish that suggest ageability.

89994,US,"Oaky, fruity and tannic now, and not showing a great deal of attractiveness, but that's because it's a young wine badly in need of cellaring. Blended in equal parts of Merlot and the two Cabernets, and made with 70% new French oak, it's all unintegrated blackberries, cherries, violets, minerals, sweet cedarwood and vanilla spice. Quite a fine wine whose softly complex tannins will enable it to age. Try after 2011.",Terzetto,93,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Volker Eisele Family Estate
89995,US,"An enormously rich, extracted Cabernet, with dramatically layered blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate flavors, liberally accented with smoky new oak.

89996,US,"A beautiful, complex and compelling wine that shows how well Napa can perform at Sauvignon Blanc, if it really wants to. It moves to the front ranks for its dryness, crispness and elegance, while delivering plenty of delicious flavor. Pineapples, lemons and limes flood the mouth, without the slightest grassy unripeness, and with a tantalizing hint of flowers and minerals. Totally elegant and sophisticated, a great white wine for the finest fare.",,93,33.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Modus Operandi
89997,US,"Just one barrel was made of this complex, nicely sculpted, 100% Malbec. It's from fourth leaf fruit, showing bright and fresh raspberry flavors, compact herbs, and streaks of tar and earth.

90000,US,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese is much drier, more acidic and earthier than many other Napa reds. Therein lies its strengh and its weakness. It's a firm wine with suggestions of cherries and tobacco that will satisfy folks who complain about fruit bombs. But it's also pretty tart. Drink now with rich Italian-inspired fare.",La Castellana,87,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,Castello di Amorosa
90001,Spain,"Composed, balanced and with all the dots connected; this is what we like about basic, affordable Rioja.

90003,Spain,"Pungent and sweaty smelling on first blush, almost suggesting Verdejo or Sauvignon Blanc. It remains oily and nettled on the nose, with sharpness.

Potent for the variety.",,87,22.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Don Olegario

90007,US,"Light strawberry and black cherry fruit is the story here, backed with decent acidity. Tannins are dark and well-structured, so the wine keeps its balance.

90191,US,"Tastes more like Zinfandel than Syrah, with intense black pepper, wild berry, currant and leather flavors, but that aside, it's a pretty good wine. Dry and tannic, it calls for barbecue.",Alegria Vineyard Axiom,86,33.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Acorn
90192,Portugal,"Initially tight and mineral, this wine then begins to show structure—fresh, toasty wood and spice. Green apple skin and melon flavors give both structure and ripeness. Think food with this wine.",,86,,Douro,,,Portuguese White,Burmester
90193,Portugal,"A blended style of Madeira, this is rich, soft, without the ineffable bite of a wine made from the classic varieties, but certainly with acidity and wood as well as a full, caramel-flavored aftertaste.",Duke of Clarence Rich,86,,Madeira,,,Madeira Blend,Blandy's
90194,US,"A blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah, this red is soft and fairly tannic.

Drink now.",Mark's Vineyard,86,45.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,AmByth
90195,Spain,"A warm and earthy wine with baked dark-fruit aromas covered in a blanket of fully toasted oak. This bruiser, like its brothers, is all-out Garnacha. It carries a stated 15.5% alcohol, and the flavors are of roasted black plum, blackberry and wood. More lively than the reserve-level wines from Alto Moncayo, but still hard, demanding and heavy. 500 cases made.",Veraton,86,27.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Garnacha,Alto Moncayo

90198,Spain,"Dusty and plump up front, with a hint of melon. The palate is round and easygoing, with moderate acidity supporting baked apple and melon flavors.

90199,US,"Seta is the winery's Sémillon-Sauvignon Blanc blend. It's barrel-fermented, using native yeasts. Like the 2005, which it resembles, it's over-worked. Heavy oak dominates the interesting, complex citrus and fig flavors, flooding the mouth with too much caramel and butterscotch.",Seta Proprietary White Wine,86,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Signorello
90200,US,"High alcohol gives this Zin a hot burn, but it's part of the wine's personality. That's along with the chocolate, black currant, cassis and pepper flavors and rich, thick tannins.

90202,US,"A good wine, but a little awkward and brooding, all sharp elbows and knees. The tannins are edgy, and the currant, mint and cedar flavors are all over the place.

90203,US,"Shows a good tannin structure and well-ripened fruit, with rich flavors of berries, chocolate and carrot cake. But it sure is sweet. Part of that is from nearly 16% acidity.",Tori Vineyard,86,32.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wilson
90204,US,"here too many Pinot Grigios are sweet and sugary, this one's dry, and it has a crisp acidity that makes the mouth water.

90218,Spain,"Broad, dark and meaty, with aromas of leather and beef broth. The palate comes on as bulky and tannic, but the flavors are full and deep even if they are also a touch soupy and meaty.

90229,US,"Few wines are as ripe and fruity as this. It's explosive in raspberry jam and cherry pie flavors, with scads of dusty pie spices, and the smooth tannins make it silky in the mouth.

Cellar this lovely wine until 2011, if you can keep your hands off it.",Estate,93,50.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Toulouse
90283,US,"A big, fruity and way too young Pinot that badly wants time in the cellar. It's bone dry and tannic, but with a silky texture that frames ripe, primary flavors of cherries, red currants, cola, bacon and spices, accented with fine, smoky oak. Give it through 2010 to come around, and should age for another six years beyond that.",Talley-Rincon Vineyard,93,40.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Sinor-LaVallee
90284,US,"This is a Pinot you have to use your judgment on concerning ageability, because it's too young now. It's very jammy-fruity in raspberries, cherries, bacon and cola, with sweet, smoky oak not yet integrated. But it's a beautifully structured, balanced wine of great integrity, and should develop in the bottle. Best after 2011.",Fe Ciega Vineyard,93,54.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Longoria
90285,US,"A very nice, dry Cab Franc that shows real elegance and sophistication. The tannins are rather fierce, with a sandpapery astringency, and the wine shows a deep, pure core of red and black cherries. Delicious and complex, but those tannins need rich fare for balance. Lamb comes to mind.",,93,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Franc,La Jota Vineyard
90286,France,"This is a gorgeous wine, the ripe fruit of the year giving weight, the dry botrytis giving intensity. Ginger, sweet orange and a big burst of citrus all balance so well.",L'Extase,93,57.0,Southwest France,Monbazillac,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Domaine l'Ancienne Cure
90287,Australia,"Takes ripeness to its uppermost limits without going over the top, with aromas of leather and chocolate leading into flavors of chocolate, dried fruit and coffee. It's full bodied, concentrated and creamy in texture, with a long, lush finish. Despite the ripeness and richness, it's under 15% alcohol. Drink now-2020.",Oscar Semmler Single Vineyard Reserve,93,60.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Dutschke
90288,France,"This is the show stopper of the range from Alain Dominique Perrin's Lagrezette. It expresses the most powerful Malbec tannins and superripe fruit, without losing sight of the mineral edge. The fruit of this beautiful wine, while opulent, is poised with fine acidity.",Le Pigeonnier,93,110.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Château Lagrézette
90289,Australia,"Verging on impenetrable, this is a dark and intensely concentrated offering. Aromas of asphalt, black olive and tea leaves hint at the complexities yet to emerge, while the richly tannic palate is chewy and drying yet mouthwatering at the same time. Drink 2015–2025.",Piggott Range,93,110.0,South Australia,Clarendon,,Syrah,Clarendon Hills

90292,US,"Three quarters Cab Franc, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Merlot, all from the Champoux vineyard.

Dense, detailed and delicious, this represents exceptional value.",Champoux Vineyard,93,30.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Franc,O•S Winery
90293,Australia,"One of Clarendon Hills' more affordable wines, the 2007 Moritz Syrah carries an intriguing hint of green peppercorn on the nose, alongside blueberries and graham crackers. Then the flavors turn meatier and more savory, blending in black olives and coffee. It's medium in body and structured with silky tannins, making it immediately approachable. Drink now–2020.",Moritz,92,60.0,South Australia,Clarendon,,Syrah,Clarendon Hills
90294,US,"A big, young Pinot Noir that shows brilliant stuffing and complexity, but it's rather heavy and tannic now, and not a wine to open before, say, 2011 at the very least. In its youth it displays rich, jammy flavors of red cherries, raspberries, Dr. Pepper cola, beef jerky and smoky sandalwood, and is very dry. Should evolve slowly through 2015 or beyond.",Starr Ridge Vineyard - Dijon Clones,92,50.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell

90296,US,"Certain Yakima valley vineyards attain a riveting complexity with Syrah—Dineen is one of them. The mix of wild berry, pomegranate syrup, coffee liqueur, composted earth, smoke and chocolate is compelling. This is Syrah that stands apart from most other New World versions, has the acid and balance to age, and the complexity to keep you coming back for another glass.",Dineen Vineyard,92,35.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,O•S Winery
90297,US,"Here's a dry, briskly crisp young Pinot Noir that offers plenty of pleasure now and should develop in the bottle. It's a big wine, dark and saturated in cherries, blackberries and red plums, with the prettiest vanilla and toast flavors from oak. Should slowly develop through 2014.",Dierberg,92,50.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Tyler
90298,Australia,"A relative bargain amid top-quality McLaren Vale Shiraz, the 2005 Top of the Hill Shiraz is beginning to show some softening and signs of maturity, yet remains intensely perfumed and flavored. Coffee bean and black olive notes start it off, backed by enough fruit richness to give it an expansive mouthfeel and long finish. Drink now–2015.",Top of the Hill,92,29.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,The Old Faithful
90299,US,"Dense and somewhat aloof, this mountain-grown Pinot Noir has firm tannins that lock it down, and the oak has not yet been integrated with the fruit. It's all elbows, an awkward young wine that needs time. Give it 3–5 years to let the cherries, currants, vanilla, smoky cedar and spices meld together.",Rapley Trail Vineyard Block B Estate,92,68.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Thomas Fogarty
90300,US,"Hooray for Novy for producing this fine, inexpensive wine and for putting their name proudly on it, instead of hiding behind a second label. It's dry and crisp and totally drinkable, with pleasant berry, cherry and spice flavors.",Four Mile Creek,87,9.0,California,North Coast,North Coast,Red Blend,Novy
90301,Spain,"Seems more earthy and damp than you might expect, with minerally notes. Sort of fiery and rugged on the palate, with tough tannins and only modest roundness and richness for a reserva-level wine from a good vintage. Shows some bitter chocolate on the finish. Needs another year in bottle to show better.",Reserva,87,,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Protos
90302,Australia,"Full bodied and supple almost to the point of syrupiness, this interesting blend combines hints of green peppercorns with bright cherry fruit. Turns tart, dusty and angular on the finish, suggesting it may improve with a couple of years in the cellar.

90304,Italy,"Collemattoni delivers a ripe, fruit-driven Brunello that will appeal to those who enjoy plump, jammy notes in their red wine.

The wine is soft and smooth with sweet berry notes on the close.",,87,55.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Collemattoni
90305,US,"Good citrus fruit flavors, along the lines of grapefruits, limes and Meyer lemons, accompanied by zesty acidity mark this bone-dry Sauvignon Blanc. It really scours the mouth clean.

90306,US,"A solid, straightforward, all-purpose Pinot Gris, this offers firm and spicy pear and apple fruit, some crisp phenolics giving it a racy edge, and a little bite to the back of the palate. It has the acidity to stand up to creamy pasta sauces or soft cheeses.",,87,17.0,Oregon,Oregon,Oregon Other,Pinot Gris,Evergreen Vineyards
90307,US,"A delightfully spicy, rich Zinfandel, packed with fruity flavors ranging from blackberries and cola through chocolate to raisins.

90308,Spain,"Minty black cherry aromas give it a solid opening, but there's also some mild cleanser and paint scents to the nose. The palate is basic, snappy, fresh and carries good weight, while the flavors are sweet, berry-oriented and softened by vanilla. A good Grenache with good balance.",Atteca Old Vines,87,16.0,Northern Spain,Calatayud,,Garnacha,Bodegas Ateca
90309,Uruguay,"The best wine from this bodega. It's focused and spicy, with black fruit and depth to the nose and none of the weird, rubbery, roasted characteristics that are sometimes found in Uruguayan wines.

90322,US,"This feels over-cropped, dilute, with more than a little tomato leaf and vegetable among its rather delicate scents and flavors.

90455,Portugal,"Very ripe, this wine has tropical fruits, a full, soft texture and a mouthfilling floral character. Its mango and peach flavors are deliciously balanced with light, sweet acidity.",Pilheiros Branco,86,20.0,Douro,,,Portuguese White,J. & F. Lurton
90456,US,"Creamy and fruity, this Viognier has forward flavors of pineapples, limes, ripe green apples, vanilla, honey and cinnamon spice, balanced with crisp acidity, and totally dry on the finish. It's an easy, enjoyable wine.",,86,26.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Viognier,Meadowcroft
90457,Spain,"This ranks as a good no-frills white wine from central Spain. Viura is at its best when it's crisp, clean and tastes like apples and honeydew. And for the most part, that's exactly what this is. There's freshness and scour, but it's not acidic or sharp. Still, best to drink it as soon as possible.",,86,9.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Viura,Maximo
90458,US,"A good wine. It's a little tough and gritty in texture, but shows ripe flavors of black currants, mocha and spices. Finishes sweet and tannic, but not an ager.",,86,30.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Franc,Opolo
90459,US,"Silverado's Merlot has been variable over the years. This '04 is fruit-driven, a soft, direct and appealing wine for its wealth of blackberry, cherry, plum, chocolate and leather flavors. Could develop bottle complexities with some time in the cellar.",,86,32.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Silverado
90460,US,"Battle Creek has dropped its price significantly, but it still tastes like a fruity, everyday Pinot trying to compete in the big leagues. It's got light flavors of black cherry candy, very tart acids and a little zip to the finish; if there are any new barrels involved, they are currently in hiding.",,86,40.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Battle Creek
90461,Spain,"Yellow in color, with honeyed peach aromas. There is no indication of oak, but it probably went through extended lees aging, which explains the wine's richer melon, apricot and honey flavors. Almost Chardonnay-like in body and weight, but with more tropical, tree-fruit flavors and aromas. Drink immediately; it's on the way out.",Miros Alba de Miros,86,16.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Bodegas Peñafiel
90462,Portugal,"For a wine at this price, this is an impressive performance. It is rich, finely structured, the juicy blackberry flavors filling the mouth. It may lack complexity, but the spice, tobacco and berry flavors are enjoyably drinkable.",Cortello,86,7.0,Estremadura,,,Touriga Nacional,Dão Sul
90463,US,"Made in a ripe, extracted style, this pleasant Cab-Merlot blend has flavors of currants, plums, cedar and spice. Seems at its best now and for a couple years.",Metamorphosis,86,58.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jaffe

90465,US,"A good Cabernet, if a little gritty, with herb-infused flavors of black currants, plums and spices. Might soften with a few years in the bottle, but not really a longterm ager.",Director's Cut,86,29.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Francis Ford Coppola

90470,Spain,"Bramble and brine are present on the nose, and while 2005 was a very good vintage in Rioja, this wine brings a little less than expected. It's endowed with snappy red-fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, and there's also vanilla and herbal notes. The feel is dry, medium-bodied and grabby, with a hint of stemmy snap.",Crianza,86,16.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Cáceres

90472,France,"Those who seek out Gewürztraminer for its intense, exotic nose will want to look elsewhere.

It finishes fairly dry, with just a hint of residual sugar.",Reserve,86,17.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Pierre Sparr
90473,Spain,"Can't call this an elevated or complex wine, but we can say that it's big and bold, with plum, berry and dill aromas. In the mouth, it's not overly vocal but it is fulfilling. Flavors of plum, vanilla and aged cheese are nice, while coconut comes up on the finish. A wine to drink without contemplation.",Crianza,86,14.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,El Circulo

90476,US,"Blue Chip is the name of the farm, and this blend, from young vines, is one of the lightest Oregon Pinots in memory.

Unusual, to say the least.",Blue Chip Blend,86,22.0,Oregon,Columbia Gorge (OR),Oregon Other,Pinot Noir,Wy'East Vineyards
90477,Spain,"A touch of volatility accompanies opening black fruit and plum aromas, while the palate brings both a raisiny essence and austere acidity that causes tartness. For basic Priorat, this is fine. But if you're looking for greatness, there isn't much to speak of. Overall, it's a good but regular wine, nothing more or less.",Negre,86,16.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Scala Dei
90478,Spain,"A perennial Best Buy, Sangre de Toro always delivers a quality red-wine experience that does not bowl you over. Here the aromas are light and jammy, with strawberry.

90480,Chile,"A touch earthy and leathery at first, but also berry driven and full, with a lot of run to it. The palate has a round, full feel as well as flavors of black cherry, cassis, herbs and tobacco. Chunky on the finish, where it flattens out.

90482,US,"This is a good, full-bodied, dry Cabernet that delivers with plenty of varietal personality.

90488,US,"This is a dry, tannic and extracted young red wine. Made mainly from Merlot, with 15% Malbec, it has blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate flavors.

90489,Italy,"Here is a very nicely balanced Barbaresco with sweet spice notes and plump fruit tones of wild berry, cherry and blackberry. What the wine offers in harmony, it lacks in overt intensity: it shows flat, broad character in the mouth with wet earth and mineral tones on the finish.",Vallegrande,88,,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Grasso Fratelli
90490,Italy,"This youthful expression of Barbera comes forth with ripe and raw aromas of black fruit, plum, prune and wild berries. You really feel the freshness of the fruit here and this wine would pair perfectly with pasta or pizza.",,88,19.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,,Barbera,Damilano
90491,Italy,"This Riserva expression of Barbaresco opens with a light ruby color and charred aromas of wood, spice and smoke. You'll also identify cherry cola, tar, licorice and violet.

90492,US,"Fruity and full-flavored, this quaffable Riesling brings a full share of peachy fruit, honeysuckle and English breakfast tea. The residual sugar is just over 1%, and the acids compensate, giving it good balance.",,88,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Riesling,Cave B
90493,US,"This is a fine Pinot Noir. May not be as full-bodied or fruity as some, but it's truly elegant, crisply refined, and thoroughly dry, offering raspberry, rhubarb, tangerine zest and Dr. Pepper cola flavors that are wrapped into a silky texture. Production was a low 820 cases.",,88,18.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Chime
90494,Italy,This wine shows a touch of age or flatness and its ruby color also shows some mild browning. The wine will hold a few more years but the fruit tones present now won't last forever. You'll get aromas of wild berries and red apple.,Colarej,88,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Cantine Gemma

90497,US,"The 80% new oak on this wine really sticks out, giving toasty, caramelized and vanilla bean notes. That makes the underlying cherry, blackberry and raspberry fruit, which is superripe, taste jammy, almost sweet. The result is a little in your face, but it's quite a rich wine that might develop some bottle nuance over the next 4–6 years.",Reserve,88,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Titus

90504,US,"This Cabernet Franc-based Bordeaux blend is softly approachable now for its wealth of black and red cherry, currant and toasty oak flavors. It has rich tannins and a long, spicy finish.

90508,US,"A pretty good Cab that shows plenty of richness. May lack a bit in nuance, but on the other hand, a little cellaring could benefit. As currently constructed, it's rich and forward in berry-cherry fruit and oak, with lots of spices, and tastes a bit jammy-sweet. Honig's single-vineyard Cabs always seem much better than their generic Napa Valley.",,87,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Honig

90511,US,"Here's an extraordinarily rich, flavorful red wine and here's how you should use it. Take a slab of beef, give it a super spice rub, then grill it, maybe with some veggies, and enjoy.

90512,France,"Like a Rubens nude, this wine is fat and round, but somehow quite appealing, with layers of plump, ripe fruit and a luxurious texture.

90518,Chile,"Quintay's Clava seems to have the makings of a perennial Best Buy.

90521,Chile,"Give it air time and it'll give back floral raspberry and cherry aromas in front of a racy, forward-style palate that's got cherry and red plum flavors and integrated spice.

90522,Chile,"Big, burly, medicinal aromas get it going, and there's no shortage of creamy, spicy oak as well.

90524,US,"Compare this with the winery's 2005 bottling (they were co-released for some reason), and you get a good example of vintage variation.

90529,Argentina,"Standard all the way, but isn't that what we want from a $9 wine? The nose offers raspberry and strawberry aromas, while the flavors are generic but familiar, with a lean toward cherry and berry. Solid on the finish, and fairly intense as a whole.

90532,Chile,"Dry and cheesy-smelling at first, then more toasty. The palate struggles to present clean, linear, integrated fruit, oak and earth. Instead, it's rather murky and buttery, the latter characteristic a reflection of the oak the wine rested in. Ultimately it's more about oak and earth than fruit and harmony.",San Lorenzo Estate,86,28.0,Maipo Valley,,,Red Blend,Chono

90535,Chile,"Toasty and relatively smooth, with a comfortable nose and body. Smoothness is this wine's prime attribute, while the flavors are your basic apple and citrus. Finishes with tang and zest, and overall the wine satisfies while not pressing too hard to do so.",Reserva,86,11.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Apaltagua
90536,US,"A little more tannic, dry and robust than your typically soft, cult-style Napa Cab. You could call it old-fashioned, with its blackberry and cedar flavors and brisk structure. Suffers from some overripe raisins in the finish, and not likely to age, so drink up.",,86,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hopper Creek

90539,US,"A big, chewy wine, ultrarich in black currants and plums, but quite tannic. Seems like one you want to cellar. One compromise is a funky aroma that could indicate longterm instability.",Barrouge,86,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Barlow

90720,US,"An awesome wine—this is so massively intense in blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors, it's hard to believe. From the first sip though the middle palate, it's seemingly sweet with a fruity essence, but the finish is dry and firm. Drink now and for 8–10 years, at the very least.",Agira Vineyard,96,80.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Von Strasser
90721,US,"This is classic Three Palms Merlot—as excellent as anything Duckhorn has ever produced. It shows the hard tannins that always mark the winery's Bordeaux-style red wines, but it's luscious and deep in berry fruit, licorice, grilled meat and cola. It should have no difficulty negotiating the years. Give it until around 2015, but if you can't wait, at least decant it for a few hours.",Three Palms Vineyard,95,85.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Duckhorn
90722,US,"Showing lovely silkiness, dryness and transparency, this is a Pinot to drink now or age for a while. The flavors are rich but elusive, suggesting wild summer raspberries, cola, pine needles and sautéed mushrooms splashed with balsamic, with the sweet smokiness of oak barrel aging. It's delicate and powerful, but only 47 cases were produced.",Gap's Crown Vineyard,95,50.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Furthermore
90723,US,"This portion of the winery's vineyard always yields Cabernets of enormous concentration with hard tannins. The 2009 is a classic, detonating in the mouth with laserlike blackberry and cassis flavors, to which new oak brings additional richness of smoky cedar. It's really a beautiful wine, but very tannic, even by Von Strasser standards. Give it at least eight years, and it could be drinking well 20 years from now.",Sori Bricco Vineyard,95,80.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Von Strasser
90724,US,"This has so much rich earth and minerality, it's like a journey deep into a mine. It's noted the vines were planted in 1970, and the wine does have that old-vine concentration of fruit in the form of massively intense blackberries. Then there's the smoky new oak, which adds such a lusciously sweet jacket of buttered toast. Tannic and tight in the way of Diamond Mountain Cabernets, this should begin to come into its own after 2016.",Spaulding Vineyard,95,80.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Von Strasser
90725,US,"This is a big Pinot Noir, with an explosive intensity of cherries and raspberries that is ripe and pure. Oak, of course, is there too, in the form of buttered, smoky toast. However, the wine isn't a mere fruit bomb. It has interesting nuances of earthy things, like mushrooms, nettles and Provençal herbs. The silky texture is an exquisite balance of acids and tannins. This new brand from Hall winery is made by their talented winemaker, Steve Leveque, and it immediately enters the California pantheon of excellent Pinot Noirs.",The Corners,95,60.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Walt
90726,US,"You will want to age this Cabernet—8 or 10 years of development is the only way to allow the hard tannins to begin to melt away, allowing the fabulous core of blackberries, currants and dark chocolate to emerge. It's hard to exaggerate the wine's depth; it's so elegantly pure, concentrated and focused. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2018, and it could still be providing pleasure 20 years from now.",,95,150.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,La Sirena
90727,US,"There's a grace and purity to this Pinot Noir that make it particularly recommendable. It's so light and silky, it just glides like a butterfly across the palate. But it's extraordinarily rich in wild raspberry and cherry fruit, and the white pepper and baking spices make it savory. Delicious now, but it should prosper over the next eight years, at least.",La Rinconada,95,60.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Sanford
90728,Italy,"One of the top, if not the top, red wines from Umbria. The naturally tannic Sagrantino grape is softened by the careful oak aging that adds layers of chocolate and spice to the grape's aromas of black cherry, tobacco and leather. This is bold, powerful, masculine and velvety on the finish. Pair it with stewed or grilled meat marinated in rosemary and garlic. Age this in a cellar for 10 years or longer.",25 Anni,95,100.0,Central Italy,Sagrantino di Montefalco,,Sagrantino,Arnaldo Caprai
90729,US,"The winery held this back an additional six months after their other 2008 Pinots were released, presumably to let it become integrated. Still, it's quite tannic, with a sandpaper-like toughness. Despite the astringency, the massive wild-cherry, cola, mushroom and anise flavors come through. It's a huge wine, feral and untamed—quite exquisite in its wildness. So delicious now, it's hard to resist, but the wise collector will cellar it for 4–5 years, maybe even longer.",Cristina Don Miguel Vineyard,95,49.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
90730,Argentina,"This is a real blaster of a Malbec, showing power, concentration and subtleties. The bouquet is full of graham cracker, cola, monster berry and moss notes, while the pure, driving palate deals flavors of toasty blackberry, spice, mocha and more. The lengthy but mellow finish hums like a fine-tuned machine. Drink now–2018.",Finca Jorge Miralles Single Vineyard,95,50.0,Mendoza Province,La Consulta,,Malbec,Trapiche
90731,US,"Bottled in March 2010 and released in September 2011, this wine is still drinking young and fresh, with firm, rustic tannins. It's gigantic in mineral-infused blackberries and black currants; the flavors are deep, intense and long-lasting into the finish. An impressive wine whose astringency requires aging, hold this until 2017, at the very least.",,94,75.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Duckhorn
90732,Italy,"Vintner Marco Caprai is the man who has tamed the tannic, unruly beast that is Sagrantino. Having carefully aged for two years in oak, this has become deeply elegant and sophisticated. Aromas of chocolate, exotic spice, dark berry, leather, tobacco and dried prune leave a lasting impression. Age for 10 years or more.",25 Anni,94,100.0,Central Italy,Sagrantino di Montefalco,,Sagrantino,Arnaldo Caprai
90733,US,"Very rich, ripe and dramatically textured, this has explosive flavors of blackberry, crème de cassis, dried herb and smoked meat flavors, enriched by smoky oak. It shows the tough, hard tannins you often find in low production mountain Cabernets. Made by the well-known consulting winemaker, Philippe Melka, it has the structure of a wine that needs age. Give it at least eight years, and it could be one that lasts decades.",Black Diamonds,94,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Parallel
90734,US,"This shows the richness and power associated with Piña Cabernet, but is just a touch drier and more acidic than the winery's offerings from warmer parts of Napa. With blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wrapped into ample tannins, it's a wine that seriously wants at least 6–8 years in the cellar.",Wolff Vineyard,94,85.0,California,Yountville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Piña
90735,US,"Dark and saturated in color, this has earthy and meaty aromas like bloody, rare steak and charred bone—that sort of proteinous spirit. The actual fruit flavor is incredibly rich and concentrated in blackberries, black currants and crisp bacon. The impression is of a sweet, delicious Cabernet that's a touch warm in alcohol, but lush and refined.",Pritchard Hill,94,135.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chappellet
90736,US,"So rich, so opulent, this is fantastic to enjoy now. It really nails it, with intricate flavors of buttered toast, butterscotch, honey and vanilla that ride high on top of the pineapple and tropical fruit flavors. The winery is best known for Cabernet Sauvignon, but with this release, it's competing at the highest level of quality Chardonnay.",,94,48.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Parallel
90737,US,"This starts out closed and tight, shut down by tannins and immaturity, but plenty of swirling reveals elusive black-licorice and blackberry notes, accented by smoky oak. The tannins really kick in toward the middle, but hard as they are, they exhibit great breed. Despite its sweet core of fruit, this is nowhere close to being ready. Give it 10 years.",Tre Vigneti,94,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Montagna
90738,US,"So rich and seemingly sweet in black currant, chocolate fudge and toasted oak flavors, you can hardly keep from drinking the whole bottle now. But that would be a mistake. You don't want to age it so long that all the fruit drops out, but 8–10 years in the cellar should do just fine.",Rector Creek Vineyard,94,95.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Duckhorn

Vibrant coastal acidity provides essential lift to this elaborate Chardonnay.",Dierberg Vineyard,94,45.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Migration
90740,Spain,"This is incredibly inviting on the bouquet due to aromas of leather, raisin, tea and mocha. It feels lifted, benefiting from the superb structure and tannins, while the flavors of leathery berry, coffee, toast and chocolate are outstanding. This is pure, deep, elegant and impeccably balanced Tempranillo. Drink now–2018.",Vendimia Seleccionada,94,69.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,García Figuero
90741,US,"Cabernets just don't get much richer, riper or deeper than this single-vineyard beauty. Dry, tannic and fine in acidity, it's a full-frontal assault of blackberries, cassis liqueur and new oak, concentrated beyond belief. The sheer magnitude demands time in the cellar. Try after 2015, and it could go far beyond that.",Firehouse Vineyard,94,85.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Piña
90742,Argentina,"This smells as deep as an ocean trench, with mint, cola, blackberry and toast aromas all rolled into a tight bomb that's ready to explode.

90743,US,"Made in a rich, ripe style that perhaps favors power over elegance, this is delicious from start to finish. It's a big, intense wine, massive in blackberry and mocha flavors, with a bacon meatiness that's part Syrah, part smoky oak.

90746,Argentina,"This small-production Malbec is superb. The bouquet smells mossy, earthy, dense and loaded with smooth berry aromas.

90747,US,"Very pure in blackberries and black currants, this expresses the classic taste of Cabernet Sauvignon. New oak adds a lovely veneer of smoky, cedary cigar box. It's beautiful to drink now for the soft, velvety texture and appealingly sweet complexity, but should age gradually for many years.",Vineyard 2131,94,80.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Von Strasser
90748,US,"The winery's '08 bottling of this Pinot was very good, but this is considerably better. It's rich in red cherries and ripe persimmons, with complex notes of grilled beef, cola and sautéed wild mushrooms, and has a long, spicy finish. A joy to drink now, and it will develop bottle nuances over the next six years.",Horshehoe Bend Vineyard,94,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Family
90749,US,"While this Pinot is huge in fruit and has a big, heavyweight mouthfeel, somehow it never loses its sense of delicacy and charm. The flavors are the essence of cherries: ripe, sweet and intense. This richness is balanced by the earthiness of a wild mushroom risotto. With brilliant acidity, it's a wonderfully rewarding wine, easily on par with the 2009, perhaps a shade better. The grapes come from the famed Sierra Madre Vineyard.",,94,38.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Sobriquet Winery

90757,France,"A very subdued expression of the normally flamboyant Gewürztraminer grape, the opening notes are of wool and mineral.

90758,Spain,"Nobody should mistake this idiosyncratic Basque white wine for a bargain. At $25, you had better like steely, almost sour-style whites to justify going here.

90760,Spain,"Young, jumpy and slightly candied, but that's just fine given the price range it's playing in. To get old-vines Garnacha for a song is not uncommon, yet this wine's thick, fruity palate goes beyond the norm. And with a round mouthfeel built on light-framed tannins, it's easygoing as can be.

90768,Spain,"A little bit strange and unusual on the nose, with roasted meat, young oak, popcorn and only modest fruit aromas.

90799,US,"Fidélitas offers three different Merlots in its lineup, this being the least expensive. It's a fine, everyday bottle, broadly displayed over the core fruit flavors of plum and boysenberry. There are lightly applied highlights of fresh spring herbs, and almost no traces of barrel toast in the finish, just tart and tasty fruit.",,87,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Fidelitas
90800,US,"A bit too heavy and direct, offering strong, upfront flavors of red and black berries, stone fruits, cola and currants, liberally spiced and oaked. The mouthfeel is full and weighty, lacking some elegance, but it is totally dry. Could be a sleeper.",,87,40.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Firefly Night

90804,US,"A bit more direct than the '05, which must be due to the so-so vintage. The wine is soft and immediately appealing for its red berry pie filling, red currant, baking spice, green olive tapenade and oak flavors. Should develop for years in the bottle, without necessarily gaining additional complexity.",Red Winery Vineyard,87,60.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hawkes
90805,Italy,"This tight and firm Barbaresco from the Rio Sordo cru exhibits an orange tinge to its garnet color and shows aromas of licorice, exotic spice, old leather and dried tobacco leaf. The wine seems older than it actually is, but those polished tannins should pull it forward a few more years at least.",Rio Sordo,87,64.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Cascina delle Rose
90806,US,"Hard to beat the delicious flavors in this mountain Merlot. It explodes in the mouth with blackberry jam, cherry liqueur, melted milk chocolate, licorice and sweet oak flavors. Pretty good in the modern style, with a minor quibble that there's some sharpness throughout.",,87,22.0,California,Calaveras County,Sierra Foothills,Merlot,Albeno Munari
90807,US,"Here's a nice, clean, elegantly structured 100% Sauvignon Blanc. It has flavors of oranges, grapefruits and peaches. Although there's no new oak on it, the notes of sweet vanilla and buttered toast are strong.",,87,34.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Alpha Omega
90808,US,"Nice and dry, with lots of black pepper-infused wild blackberry flavors wrapped into big but pliant tannins. Lots of crunchy acidity, too, which makes the wine sharp. Will be great with a rich steak.",,87,32.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,Casa Torres
90809,US,"A delightful rosé sparkler, rich in raspberry, cherry and toasty, yeasty flavors, with a smooth, creamy mouthfeel and a honey-sweet finish.

90810,Chile,"Slightly hard, burnt and earthy at first, with dark fruit sitting below that cap. The palate is tannic, thus the mouthfeel clamps down and closes up like a clam. More generous and savory in terms of flavors, with roasted black fruit and aged cheese notes. Narrow and grapey on the finish, but legit.",,86,10.0,Maipo Valley,,,Syrah,Carmen

90816,Argentina,"Cola, black cherry and lemony grit mark the bouquet, which is backed by acid-driven, lightly lemony flavors of cherry and raspberry.

90820,US,This single-vineyard Chard with no oak has a light bouquet with nuances of white florals and red apple.

90825,Italy,"This well saturated rosé opens with a dark pink, almost ruby color and offers aromas of red fruit and forest berry that are not particularly intense. The neutral nose suits the wine fine because it makes up for it with a thick, smooth mouthfeel and ripe berry flavors.",Venas Rosato,86,8.0,Southern Italy,Terra degli Osci,,Rosé,Cantine Cipressi
90826,Chile,"Definitely a dark wine with heavy concentration. Aromas are foresty and rich, but also soft and soupy. The palate is quite heavy and full, with reduced black fruit and herbal flavors. So ripe that prune and raisin come up on the finish. Has its merits but also a few balance issues.",Don Maximiano Estate Single Vineyard,86,21.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Carmenère,Errazuriz

90832,Argentina,"A chunky wine with a full, round, sweet, tropical outlook. The nose settles on pineapple chunks, while the creamy palate features flavors of baked yellow apple and melon. Finishes upright, which is better than many. Not sophisticated but still good for Argentina.",Reserve,86,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Cruz Alta
90833,Argentina,"A nice, regular sort of Malbec for everyday drinking. The nose is familiar, with basic berry aromas that have some sharpness, while the palate is solid if a bit tangy, with lively cherry flavors. Juicy and fresh, although slightly angular in feel. Ages only three months in oak, hence the fruit-forwardness.",Estate Bottled,86,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Dante Robino
90834,US,"A well-made wine with a creamy texture and long finish, infused with aromas and flavors of buttered toast, grilled peaches, apple skins and almond shells.

90837,Chile,"Potent and earthy, with a good set of dark fruit aromas, plus tar, horse hide and peanuts on the nose. That all may sound wild and funky, but it settles down and offers nicely roasted berry flavors, a chewy body and finally olive and herbs on the finish.",Reserva,86,12.0,Rapel Valley,,,Carmenère,Agustinos

90839,US,"A good, somewhat common wine that displays lots of rich fruit, but also the fundamental weaknesses that Sangiovese displays in California. The wine is dry and medium-bodied, with cherry, black raspberry, coffee and leather flavors. But it's a bit sharp in acidity and rugged in the mouth.",Pauli Ranch,86,42.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Sangiovese,Muscardini

90841,US,"There's something old-fashioned about this wine, in its strong, edgy tannins and rustic mouthfeel. Yet it's high and hot in alcohol, with extracted, jammy cherry and raisin flavors.

90842,US,"Dry and acidic, this 100% Cabernet isn't offering much now. It's strong in tannins and modest in blackberry fruit.

90843,US,"Dry and thin, with diluted cherry flavors. Oak fortunately adds needed vanilla and smoky char richness. The lack of fruity concentration accentuates the alcohol and acidity. Drink now.",,85,48.0,California,Mount Veeder,Napa,Pinot Noir,Dutch Henry Winery
90844,Argentina,"Smells largely neutral, with slightly earthy red fruit aromas. The palate is soft and creamy, what I'd call low in acidity, with mellow, mildly baked flavors of black cherry and chocolate powder.

Smooth, ripe and ready to drink.",,85,10.0,Washington,Rattlesnake Hills,Columbia Valley,Merlot,Hyatt
90849,Spain,"Stony apple aromas are mostly neutral and lead to a fleshy, semisoft palate with citrus, kiwi and notes of oxidation. Nice and easy but sort of plump and bland.

90874,US,"A beautiful wine, dry, complex and crisp, and easily one of the best white Rhône-style bottlings of the vintage. It shows brilliantly clean acidity that provides a brisk mouthfeel to the apricot, pineapple and pear flavors that rest on a firm ground of minerals. Great as a richer, more exotic alternative to Sauvignon Blanc.",Saralee's Vineyard,92,28.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Marsanne-Roussanne,Eric Ross
90875,US,"Superripe and oaky in pineapple, white peach purée, pear tart, buttered toast and vanilla-infused crème brûlée, this Chardonnay is saved from mere richness by crisp coastal acidity and a fine spine of minerals.

90876,US,"Even in a high acid vintage such as 2008, this is rich, almost oily, a full-throttle wine well-endowed with full-bodied fruit flavor. Though 50% new oak is used, the barrels are bigger (92 gallons instead of 55) which reduces the toastiness.

90878,Austria,"This could be the apotheosis of St Laurent, a powerful statement of great concentrated tannins and texture to go with the naturally red fruited character of the grape.

For aging 2–3 years.",Ried Holzspur Grande Reserve,92,89.0,Thermenregion,,,St. Laurent,Johanneshof Reinisch

Delicious and compelling.",Justification,92,45.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Justin
90881,US,"This could be labeled Cabernet Sauvignon; the only other grape is Cab Franc (11%).

The final has spice, pepper and a tang of acidity.",Reserve,92,46.0,Burgenland,,,St. Laurent,Juris
90885,US,"A very pale wine, barely more than a rosé in hue, but very flavorful.

90887,Austria,"The wine's name means “wide world” and, with its base of Bordeaux grapes, this is Triebaumer looking outside Austria. It is big, dark in color, piled high with black berry fruits and somewhat severe tannins. The structure is big, solid, very direct, but bringing in a strong wood element. Worth aging for 3–4 years.",Weite Welt,92,39.0,Burgenland,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Gunter Triebaumer
90888,Italy,"This is a very distinctive and highly unusual Syrah from organic and biodynamic producer Duemani (“two hands”). The main theme here is crushed black pepper but beyond that you will also encounter notes of blackberry, cured meat, leather and spice. Throughout it all, those beautifully pristine pepper tones truly define this wine.",Suisassi,92,120.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Syrah,Duemani
90889,US,"This blend is dusty, fragrant and loaded with exotic baking spices, cocoa and black fruits. A rich, supple and seductive wine with a silky mouthfeel.",Marie's View Red,92,80.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Den Hoed
90890,Austria,"Biiri is the old name for vineyards in Deutschkreuz, the home of the Igler winery. This is a smooth, mint-perfumed wine, shot through with wood, but also bringing some solid red fruits to the fore. It is weighty, but not overpowering. For the wood to fully integrate, give it another year.",Biiri Reserve,92,34.0,Mittelburgenland,,,Blaufränkisch,Hans Igler
90891,US,"Marked by aggressive acidity and some dusty tannins, this Pinot is not showing well now. It's just too hard and tart. But the flavors are enormously ripe, and the finish is dry and silky and long. It all suggests cellaring to let the cherries, black raspberries and Dr. Pepper cola emerge from their tomb. Better after 2011.",Le Bon Climat Vineyard,92,45.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Chanin
90892,France,"An impressive wine, balancing the dark, dense tannins and fruit with ease and style. Black plums fit well with sweet black figs and ripe acidity, sustained by just the right amount of wood. It is powerful, but not overpowering.",L'Excellence,92,30.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Château la Reyne
90893,US,"This is delicious, co-fermented with 4% Malbec. It opens with a fresh mix of berries, toast, chocolate and mocha; adding spice, a hint of pepper, and showing great balance. Though the alcohol hits 15%, the wine shows no heat in the mouth; it's supple and the fruit is absolutely delicious.",,92,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Tulpen
90894,Italy,"This is a generous Bordeaux blend from Coastal Tuscany with luscious notes of chocolate, spice, sweet cherry, leather and pipe tobacco. There's a note of ripe fruit as well and the mouthfeel is driven by a powerful blast of exotic spice, clove and cardamom. Pair it with succulent sirloin.",Coronato,92,75.0,Tuscany,Bolgheri,,Red Blend,Tenuta di Biserno
90895,Italy,"Here's an elegant and sophisticated Riserva (in a gorgeous bottle with a pretty wax seal on the front that would look stunning on any formal dinner table) with generous aromas of black cherry, toasted almond and exotic spice. This 50-50 Sangiovese/Cabernet Sauvignon blend is full and luscious and makes a fabulous, long-lasting impression in the mouth.",Campaccio Selezione Riserva,92,69.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Terrabianca
90896,Italy,"Modern and focused, but generous and intense at the same time, Ceppate (90% Cabernet Sauvignon with 10% Merlot) is a beautifully shaped wine with equal parts fruit and spice. It is soft and slightly sweet on the palate but also delivers extraordinary length and persistency.",Ceppate,92,69.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Terrabianca
90897,US,"Dense and a little heavy now, this concentrated young Pinot Noir needs time in the cellar. It's rich and ripe in black and red cherry pie filling, with notes of red currants, cola, anise, bacon and pepper. Simply too young, so give it 3–5 years if you can.",Rapley Trail Vineyard Block M Estate,92,68.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Thomas Fogarty
90898,Australia,"This is one of the early stars of South Australia's highly variable 2008 vintage. Herbal, smoky and vaguely peppery upfront, this is full bodied and creamy in texture without being soft, boasting intense raspberry and blueberry fruit framed by cedar and smoke. Finishes with surprising firmness and structure, but it should round into form by the end of 2010 and last through at least 2020.",,92,32.0,South Australia,Mount Benson,,Shiraz,Oliverhill
90899,Italy,This is a sophisticated and very modern approach to Vino Nobile di Montepulciano with an evident oak intervention that adds layers of spice and smoke to a rich palate of forest berry and blackberry. The wine is smooth and dense in the mouth and offers very impressive staying power. Give it another five years of cellar aging.,Asinone,92,65.0,Tuscany,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,,Prugnolo Gentile,Poliziano
90900,Spain,"Grapey and potent as Rioja crianzas go, with a medium-to-full-sized palate that's full of bright acidity and standard but solid berry fruit flavors. It's the slightest bit creamy and thick on the finish, but overall it's about as middle of the road as any wine on the market.",Crianza,86,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Finca Nueva
90901,US,"Young vines, the first release from estate-grown fruit. The vanilla flavors of the barrels are front and center at the moment, though there are darker fruits in the background, along with smoke, licorice and a hint of tar. Good long-term potential.",,86,34.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Southern Oregon,Petite Sirah,Folin Cellars

90905,France,"At three years old, this wine is showing some interesting developed aromas of almond paste and petrol while the lightweight palate displays some nice butter tones. Pick this one up soon, for it seems to be fading.",,86,17.0,Provence,Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence,,White Blend,Le Classique from the 3 Springs Vineyard
90906,Spain,"Very light in body, color and aromas. The nose is punchy and a bit sharp, and so is the palate, which offers crisp, bracing acids to highlight zesty, lean nectarine and tangerine flavors. Quite linear and citric, but experience with this wine says it shows best with food.",,86,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Rosé,Muga
90907,US,"Smells and tastes overoaked, with toothpicky vanilla and smoky char notes. The amount of new French wood was 50%. The jammy raspberry, cherry and currant fruit just isn't intense or complex enough to support all that weight. Drink now.",Durell Vineyard,86,44.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pali
90908,Spain,"Soda pop-like on the nose, with a clear reference to Sprite and 7Up. The palate is somewhat candied and simple, but it has good feel and the flavors of lemon-lime are likable. Mild on the finish, with flavors that extend from the lemon-lime bouquet and palate.",Brut,86,14.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Mistinguett
90909,US,"Notable for its dryness, crispness of acidity and the brightness of the citrus fruit and honeysuckle flavors. Could be Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio, but whatever, it's a very nice, clean white wine.",Randle Hill Vineyard,86,20.0,California,Yorkville Highlands,North Coast,Sémillon,Yorkville Cellars
90910,US,"Lots to like in this creative blend of Vermentino, Verdelho, Viognier and Sauvignon Blanc. It's well acidified, with citrus, orange blossom, peach, apricot, buttercream and mineral flavors. Just a bit too sweet, though, with a sugary taste throughout.",White4 Huerhuero,86,16.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,White Blend,Vina Robles
90911,US,"Off-dry with a candied orange character, this is indeed a mélange, including portions of seven different white wine grapes. It's an interesting wine, though might prove a bit challenging to match to food. Perhaps a curry?",Mélange Blanc,86,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,White Blend,Waterbrook
90912,US,"A super-fruity, direct Pinot, rather one-dimensional in cherry, raspberry and mocha flavors. Dry and crisp, with a silky texture, it's a good wine to drink now.",Appellations Series,86,30.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Cru
90913,Spain,"A chunky wine with compost, coffee and leather on the nose. The palate holds onto that chunkiness with clumsy flatness that goes with herbal plum and berry flavors. Airing allows it to unfold and find a better place, but always does it seem heavy and on the murky side.",Lealtanza Selección Especial Reserva,86,36.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Altanza
90914,US,"Nicely dry, acidic and minerally, with tart Meyer lemon, lime and pink grapefruit flavors. Suffers a bit from some green unripeness that suggests vegetable. Not too much, though, and pretty good for the price.",Reserve,86,18.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Concannon
90915,Spain,"The opening of smoke, rubber and black cherry comes across as being dark and good. The palate holds form with lively cherry, plum and currant flavors and finally a medium-long, somewhat warm and meaty finish. Good for an everyday, no-frills Garnacha.",Viña Alarba Old Vines,86,10.0,Northern Spain,Calatayud,,Grenache,Bodegas y Vinedos del Jalón

90918,Italy,"There's a brambly, slightly unripe or green aroma that characterizes this vintage of Poggio Antico's popular Rosso di Montalcino. That said, the wine does fill in smoothly over the palate with wild berry and spice flavors.",,86,48.0,Tuscany,Rosso di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Poggio Antico
90919,Spain,"Starts out muddled and murky, and eventually settles on rich, raisiny and slightly stewed. Seeing that this is Toro, some overripeness is almost a given, and thus the black fruit and licorice flavors are expected. Finishes warm, toasty and short, with a candied hollowness.",Crianza,86,22.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tempranillo,Tardencuba
90920,US,"Bone dry, wonderfully fresh and loaded with strawberry and watermelon flavors, hepped up with lightly peppery spice.

90921,US,"This is a jammy wine with raspberry and currant flavors, accented with pepper, anise and cocoa, with a coating of sweet oak. It's fundamentally dry, and a little simple in structure. Good now with grilled steak and chimichurri sauce.",,86,38.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Wild Oak by St. Francis
90922,Spain,"Piercing to start, with leathery, bacony and campfire aromas. Saturated, although healthy, if a bit hard and tannic. Flavors of bacon and clove are right up there with black fruit and syupy richness, and clove carries onto the finish. Needs time to breathe and unfold; 65% Garnacha and 35% Syrah.",Tinto Joven,86,17.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Garnacha-Syrah,Pagos del Moncayo
90923,US,"Way too oaky. Like drinking toothpicks, with its charred, wood flavors and oak tannins. The wine is dry and the underlying blackberry and cherry sour candy fruit is just fine, but the oak dominance makes you wonder if the wine will ever age.",Franklin Vineyard,86,75.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rutherford Ranch
90924,Australia,"A decent introduction to Australian Grenache, a bit simple and one-dimensionally cherry-fruited but clean, supple and easy to drink despite plenty of body, with just a bit of warmth on the finish. Drink now.",Bitch,86,12.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Grenache,R Wines

90926,US,"The winery mentions neutral oak barrels, though the immediate aromatic impression is still on the toasty/oaky side. The fruit comes up more slowly, along with residual CO2 that gives a spritzy mouthfeel. Yeasty, light and tart, with green apples the strongest fruit flavor.",,86,22.0,Oregon,Columbia Valley (OR),Oregon Other,Chardonnay,Cathedral Ridge
90927,US,"With a green grassiness that justifies the vineyard's name, this is a New Zealand-style wine. It's bone dry and zesty in acidity, with citrus, hay and gooseberry flavors, and more than a little feline spray you'll either love or hate.",Mesa Verde Vineyard,86,22.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Brander
90928,US,"A bit jammy and simple, with fresh, primary flavors of blackberries and cherries that are almost sweet. Oak adds creamy, smoky notes. Drink now.",,86,48.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,C. Beck
90929,Spain,"Opens with bright, popping cherry aromas that are straightforward, much like the rest of the show. The palate is regular and healthy in feel, with standard cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes the slightest bit toasty and warm. Nice but basic Rioja.",Viña Zaco,86,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Bilbainas
90930,US,"Gorgeously aromatic with scents of honeysuckle, yellow stone fruit and waxy lanolin, this balances serious fruit flavor with a layer of stony minerality and a dainty, almost lacy, layer of sugar that lingers on the palate.",,88,16.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Swedish Hill

90933,Argentina,"This brand has done well in the past few years with its value-priced Cabernet.

Dark, spicy and a touch warm on the finish.",Sustainably Farmed,88,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tilia
90934,US,"Decidely savory on the nose, aromas of bacon, brûléed sugar, grilled herb and toast highlight the black fruit core. The palate is meaty and currently locked tight with superfirm, grippy tannins. Bone dry on the finish, this should be enjoyed with a chunk of rare beef to help tame the tannic blow.",Vintner's Reserve,88,35.0,Virginia,Monticello,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Veritas
90935,US,"Named for winemaker Virginie Bourgue, this entirely stainless-fermented Sauvignon Blanc has a grassy, spicy edge reminiscent of Loire Valley whites.

90939,US,"Decadent and intense, this smells like breakfast toast that has been slathered with red currant jam, mango butter and apricot preserves, topped with a drizzle of honey.

90963,Spain,"A bit of forward oak comes across on the nose, while mocha and pretty good berry fruit keep things focused.

90977,US,"This is Duckhorn's second label for their Napa Bordeaux reds, and with this '06 vintage, it's on the thin, herbal side, with only modest cherry-berry flavors. Dry and very tannic, it's not an ager.",Red Wine,85,30.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Decoy
90978,Spain,"A little creamy, waxy and scattershot, but also far more exotic and different than most $8 wines. This is barrel-fermented Viura, but the oak level is light and manageable. Flavors of papaya, melon and citrus are almost tropical in scope, and the finish is pretty fresh. Drink right away for maximum freshness.",Conde de Valdemar,85,8.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Viura,Bodegas Valdemar
90979,Germany,"Raumland's Marie-Luise is a blanc de noirs of 100% Pinot Noir that comes across as toasty and nutty on the nose and palate, without obvious red-berry fruitiness or the earthy, sous-bois complexity of the variety. That said, it is medium in body and does make for a nice glass of bottle-matured sparkling.",Cuvée Marie-Luise Brut,85,39.0,Germany,,,Sparkling Blend,Raumland
90980,US,"A pretty good Cab, but maybe a little pricey, with candy sweet blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors and lots of caramelized, vanilla-scented oak. The tannins are a little tough and there's a minty streak.",,85,28.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sterling

90982,US,"A sound wine, dry and full-bodied, that can't quite shake off its country-cousin personality. With strong tannins and berry-cherry and herb flavors, all it needs is a rich cheeseburger to make it happy.",,85,20.0,California,Yolo County,Central Valley,Syrah,Rominger West
90983,Greece,"A blend of three indigenous red grapes, this wine starts with aromas of sweet clove, pepper, cedar and smoke, and offers a dry, clean flavor profile of red berry and pepper on the palate. Slightly rustic but approachable overall, it's a unique taste of Greek varieties.",Methistanes,84,22.0,Thessalikos,,,Red Blend,Dougos
90984,US,"A blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine shows extremely ripe, jammy blackberry and cherry flavors, and also a soft, melted mouthfeel that makes it feel flat. A bit more structure might help.",Royal Red,84,20.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Red Blend,Eagle Castle

90990,Germany,"Despite being essentially an entry-level wine, this is not simple fruity-sweet Riesling.

Drink now–2012.",Butterfly Medium Dry,89,20.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Zilliken
90991,Germany,"Superstar Egon Müller has at least kept his basic Riesling at an affordable level. At first, it's almost odorless, but give it a chance to develop in the glass and delicate apple, fern and lime notes emerge. A hint of CO2 adds to the impression of lightness, and the wine finishes crisp, racy and clean.

90995,US,"Hard to beat the Nuthouse for pure pleasure in the Argyle Pinot Noir lineup; it has substantial berry and cherry fruits, glistening with butterfat and gliding into toasted nuts and caramel flavors in the finish.

91019,Spain,"Even in a marginal vintage, you should expect a true and polished taste of Toro from Maurodos's Prima label.

Then there's the flavors that are wildly attractive in blackberries, black licorice, crispy bacon and something purple and flowery, like violets.

91026,US,"With its big, hard tannins, this is one for the cellar. There's a certain austerity that suggests the rocky soils of this mountain vineyard. But the fruit, packed into a dense core, is ripe and suggestive of blackberry and cherries.

91030,US,"There's something about this wine that strongly suggests it will improve in the cellar after a good bit of aging. As it is, it's dry, smooth, tannic and intense, with concentrated blackberry and black currant flavors, and a buttered toast note from aging in oak.

91033,US,"This late-released bottling is incredibly interesting.

Starts with gritty, rooty, mature aromas of tobacco and leaves, with red fruit scents mixed in. The palate is light but right, with elegant cherry and raspberry flavors that are not dark or heavy. Fades with vanilla and tobacco notes. Drink right away.",Chateldon Gran Reserva,85,36.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pinord
91056,Portugal,"Attractive pear aromas show up on this ripe, relatively full wine. It has some green fruit as well, giving acidity, but its palate is more rich than that, offering vanilla, fresh red apples and a creamy texture.",Branco,85,,Douro,,,Portuguese White,Quinta de Ventozelo
91057,Portugal,"The entry-level wine from Vallado is ripe, which emphasizes the red fruits, leaving the structure as a support. Flavors of black figs, dark cherries and tight spice all give interest and complexity. Drink now.",Vallado,85,20.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Vallado
91058,Spain,"A wine with faults and a few positives. On the nose, it's roasted almost to the point of being overdone. It smells like baked fruit, roasted peanuts and tire tread. Doesn't sound great, does it? But in the mouth its more true and recognizable; flavors of tomato leaf, dried red fruit, vanilla and dill are known entities, while the finish is long and draped with even more dill weed. Drink now. This is not one to save.",Selección Reserva,85,21.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Ramirez de la Piscina
91059,Israel,"A nicely balanced Chard with typical attributes of lemon rind, crisp red apple, butter and toasted nuts.

91061,US,"Luscious aromas of lemon, sweet orange and honey are followed by a burst of honey, orange and spice in this indulgent dessert wine.

91062,US,"This limited-production wine is a bit tough and awkward now, but may turn the corner in the cellar after 2009. It's softly dry and tannic, with herb-infused cherry and currant flavors.",Eight Barrels,85,38.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Spann Vineyards
91063,Spain,"With lime, citrus and other linear aromas, this is nothing if not fresh. The palate is scouring and spritzy, and swishing it across the tongue will create a sudsy mouthfeel. Amid that there are tangy lime and pear flavors, and then a cleansing finish. Best with anchovies and other sea-based appetizers. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, Imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",,85,20.0,Northern Spain,Getariako Txakolina,,White Blend,Ulacia
91064,US,"From estate-grown fruit on the Oregon side of the Columbia Gorge AVA, this light and lemony wine seems to show some lees contact and just a hint of toasted cracker. It's simple and easy drinking, but lacks real depth.",,85,18.0,Oregon,Columbia Gorge (OR),Oregon Other,Pinot Gris,Wy'East Vineyards
91065,Israel,"A ripe, juicy Merlot that is sure to be a crowd pleaser.

Loaded with aromas and flavors of red plum and cherry accented by hints of African violets and bay leaves.",Kosher,85,15.0,Galilee,,,Merlot,Recanati

91067,France,"The subdued nose on this example will appeal to drinkers who avoid fruity, highly aromatic wines. The fairly concentrated palate, which shows some pleasant nutty notes, is slightly off-dry but the finish is crisp due to a good level of supporting acidity. Serve with baked or pan-seared fish.",Les Princes Abbés,85,20.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Domaines Schlumberger
91068,US,"Has some overripe flavors of raisin skins, with bitter tannins, but the wine is fully dry, with enough black currant, coffee, black licorice and plum flavors to satisfy. Barbecue will be a perfect partner for this affordable Zin.",,85,12.0,California,California,California Other,Zinfandel,Dancing Bull

91070,Spain,"Lots of color but quiet and shy, with only minimal expressiveness throughout. The palate offers just one level of baked-fruit flavors, but no variance or complexity. And in the end it's clean and solid, but more amorphous and monotone than you'd hope for given the price. 70% Monastrell and 30% Cab Franc is the blend; 160 cases made.",Minimum,85,75.0,Levante,Valencia,,Red Blend,Bodegas Rafael Cambra
91071,Portugal,"Rustic, meaty aromas are initially off-putting. To taste, the wine has soupy concentration, but is one-dimensional.

91072,US,"This is a tantalizing red all around, with a savory sausage, cherry and spice nose and velvety waves of red berry and mushroom on the palate.

An impressive effort that will appeal to fans of softer style Cabernets.",Woodriver Vineyards,85,14.0,Idaho,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Indian Creek
91073,Spain,"A little gaseous and funky on the nose, but that's common for inexpensive Garnacha. Once it unfolds, it deals saturated, chunky black-fruit flavors, a jammy mouthfeel and fatness on the finish. It isn't all that structured, but it doesn't lack for size. Maybe a touch green at its core, but given the price that's not a major fault.",Malena,85,10.0,Catalonia,Catalunya,,Garnacha,Torres
91074,US,"Robust and full-bodied, with jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants, liberally sprinkled with crushed black pepper and cocoa.

91076,France,"The gold color and developed, bready aromas attest to the fact that this wine has a few years of age. On the palate, more youthful flavors of honey, nuts and roses are evident. The finish is surprisingly crisp, making it a good partner for drier Asian-fusion dishes.",Cuvée Marie,85,29.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Lucien Albrecht
91077,Portugal,"Like a Sauvignon Blanc in its herbaceous character, this wine is all cut grass, damp hay and tight green fruits. That makes for an initial raw character, tempered by some hints of apricot. It seems to need a few more months to develop in the bottle.",,85,,Douro,,,Portuguese White,Kopke
91078,US,"This is a tremendously ripe Zinfandel whose alcohol level, of nearly 16%, gives it a Porty aroma and taste.

91082,US,"This is the winery's low production barrel selection reserve. It shows big, zingy acidity and spicy, jammy flavors of raspberries and cherries, and is totally dry.

91083,Romania,"This bargain Pinot Noir is a pleasant surprise from Romania's Prahova Valley with pretty aromas of black cherries, bark and menthol. Concentrated plum and cherry flavors are countered by darker notes of coffee grinds, earth and bramble. Medium bodied with balanced tannins and acidity, it's a straightforward, everyday kind of wine, but a promising start for Romania's wine industry.",Reserve,87,10.0,Dealu Mare,,,Pinot Noir,Prahova Valley

Finishes in similar fashion, with dull bitter flavors and leather.",Crianza,84,32.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Red Blend,Convento San Francisco
91148,Argentina,"A little hard on the nose, with burnt undertones. The palate is hollow in the middle and the wine collapses on itself. As for flavors, look for mildly toasted and creamy white fruits and vanilla.",Torcidas,84,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Finca Vides

91150,Spain,"Waxy peach aromas seem slightly oxidized. It's round and citrusy on the palate, but in a monotone way that fades to pithy white fruits and mealy citrus.

91153,Spain,"Sweet and mildly candied on the bouquet, and then it clamps down firmly in the mouth with hard Cabernet tannins and lightly herbal, candied flavors of medicinal black cherry.

91160,Argentina,"Somewhat jammy and soupy on the nose, with a flavor profile that follows suit; it tastes slightly stewed and spicy, with both sweet fruit flavors and some bitterness.

91242,US,"Tastes like the grapes got a little too ripe, which gives the wine a sweetly jammy or pie-filling blackberry and cherry flavor.

91245,US,"When this bottling is from a ripe vintage, it can be quite good. But the cool 2007 harvest has yielded a somewhat green wine. It has grapefruit and gooseberry flavors that veer into feline territory.",Mitsuko's Vineyard,84,20.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Clos Pegase
91246,US,"Shows the pluses and minuses of this variety in California. The texture is light and silky and the wine is dry, with pleasant cherry flavor.

It flatters immediately with its wealth of blackberries, black cherries, cola and mocha that finish so dry and spicy, yet it has that extra complexity that makes it intellectually interesting. Drink now and over the next six years.",Cuvée Kristin Estate Blend Red Wine,93,55.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Korbin Kameron
91330,France,"This seems awfully civilized for Cornas, with bold, clean blueberry fruit front and center, anchored by a framework of cedar and vanilla.

91331,US,"A fine evocation of this esteemed vineyard, this shows the typical power and extracted fruit in the form of pure raspberry and cherry essence. It's all packed into a firm texture of acids, tannins and stony minerality. Upscale and elegant, it's fine now, and should develop bottle complexities over the next 6–8 years.",Rosella's Vineyard,93,50.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Furthermore
91332,US,"This is by far the most expensive of Duckhorn's new releases, but it's not the best to drink now. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's easy to imagine the winemaker singling out the most tannic and concentrated lots, but what you get is, simply, a very tannic wine. There's a gigantic core of blackberry and black currant fruit, but it's hard to appreciate because of the astringency. The suggestion is longterm aging, but there can be no guarantees.",The Discussion Estate Grown,93,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Duckhorn
91333,Portugal,"This is powerfully impressive, with its firm structure giving great depth to the rich black-cherry and plum fruits. Dense and tannic, it needs to age for at least four years.",Reserva Old Vines,93,40.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Duorum
91334,France,"In this difficult vintage, Guigal's Château Ampuis bottling shines. The kinky nose features exotic notes of celery seed, cracked pepper, hickory smoke and mixed berries, while in the mouth the wine shows ample fullness and intensity without losing any of the silky character that makes Côte Rôtie special. Drink now–2020.",Château d'Ampuis,93,160.0,Rhône Valley,Côte Rôtie,,Syrah,E. Guigal
91335,Italy,"An iconic wine of Italy and deservedly so, Biondi-Santi captures the spirit of the 2007 vintage with his clear fruit interpretations of red cherry, blackberry and cassis. The wine shows power, structure and fresh acidity that drives the long finish.",,93,180.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Biondi Santi
91336,Portugal,"An impressive, serious wine that's only produced in top vintages. It's elegant and complex, a powerful wine with its dark tannins, licorice and black plum flavors. Concentrated and intense, it's worth aging for at least four years.",Quinta do Cardo Grande Escolha,93,55.0,Beira Interior,,,Portuguese Red,Companhia das Quintas
91337,US,"Another terrific offering from Shafer, this is a wine that seems to do well regardless of the vintage. It always shows a firm minerality and slight herbaceousness, with tropical fruit flavors and a smoky coating of fine oak. It's a shade less opulent than the 2009, making this very elegant and refined, yet still rich and complex. Don't drink it too cold—airing brings out subtle nuances.",Red Shoulder Ranch,93,48.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Shafer
91338,Italy,"Compared to its basic Brunello, Querceta ups the ante with this Riserva in terms of intensity and overall power. Bold notes of cherry, spice and leather make an appearance in this fresh and firmly structured offering.",Riserva,93,62.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Querceta
91339,Portugal,"Initial new wood flavors show the youth of this complex wine. Then it fills out in the mouth with an explosive blackberry flavor and dense fruit tannins. With its power and flavor intensity, it has firm potential to age over at least five years.",Vinhas Velhas de Santa Maria,93,70.0,Beiras,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta de Foz de Arouce
91340,US,"Unbelievably rich, this tastes pretty much as excellent as the winery's more expensive Chardonnays. It really dazzles with its complex flavors of tropical fruit, green apple, pear, buttered toast and honey. It's all brightened by terrific acidity and wrapped into a creamy texture.",,93,26.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Matanzas Creek
91341,France,"The top cuvée from Mas del Périé, this is a concentrated wine, with new wood and black fruit notes.

This is an impressive wine that will need to age for at least 5–6 years.",La Pièce,93,85.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Mas del Périé
91342,Portugal,"A dark-colored, wood-aged wine, this is serious and power­ful. It has tannic weight along with a black­berry flavor, and a smooth tar and herb layer that's all balanced by the acidity. The wood still needs another year to fully integrate; age for another 2–3 years.",Herdade da Farizoa Grand Escolha,92,55.0,Alentejano,,,Portuguese Red,Companhia das Quintas
91343,Portugal,"Powerful and ripe, this is loaded with dark black fruit, spice from wood aging, licorice and bitter chocolate flavors.

91344,Portugal,"Huge and rich, this offers ripe black fruits and a concentrated structure. It's packed with a seemingly sweet blackberry flavor that serves as a counterpoint to the firm texture.

91345,US,"Tremendous flavors of honey, pear and orange jam are enriched with an oaky vanilla note.

Only 425 cases were produced.",Dean Block,92,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Houdini
91346,US,"Delicious and spicy, this has notes of cherry pie filling, cola, dried forest herb and leaf, with a touch of sweet, smoky, vanilla-tinged oak. It's a bit on the brawny side, but then, these Keefer Ranch Pinots always start out that way. Don't drink it now because it's just too hefty; give it six years in a proper cellar.",Keefer Ranch,92,48.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freeman
91347,US,"This shows a delicate silkiness and a sweet essence of wild raspberries that make it fully ready to drink now. But that quality obscures its subtleties of mineral, mushroomy earth and flower notes that add to this Pinot's great complexity. As good as it is now, it will have no trouble negotiating the next decade.",Reed,92,52.0,California,Mt. Harlan,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Calera
91348,US,"A wonderful wine, one of the best Petite Verdots in California, although the truth is there aren't all that many.

91349,France,"This full-bodied, creamy Crozes-Hermitage far outpaces expectations for the appellation, combining cherry-berry fruit with cracked pepper, mocha and licorice.

It's ready to drink now, but should evolve positively through at least 2017.",,92,36.0,Rhône Valley,Crozes-Hermitage,,Syrah,Maison Nicolas Perrin
91350,Italy,"Here's a pleasantly fresh and tonic rosé (made with Pinot grapes) that offers fragrant tones of wild berry, stone fruit and a touch of pink grapefruit.

91352,US,"This is a good, dry, racy Sauvignon Blanc that tastes fresh and young, despite being almost three years old. Shows tangy ruby grapefruit and lime flavors, with richer kiwi and vanilla notes. The price is very good for the quality.",,86,10.0,California,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Ruby Hill Winery
91353,US,"A tough, leathery wine, very dry and pretty tannic, with pleasant berry, cherry, currant and spice flavors. It's mainly Syrah, with 14% Cabernet Franc, and shows mouthwateringly crisp acidity.",,86,18.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Red Blend,Rumpus
91354,Austria,"Pinot Blanc is never the most expressive grape, and this wine is certainly on the neutral side. But it does give soft, layered fruit, pear and apricot flavors, light acidity and a texture that will work with food. Screwcap.",,86,11.0,Burgenland,,,Weissburgunder,Tinhof

91358,US,"The nose is lively and jumpy with notes of tart gooseberry, Granny Smith apple, lemony citrus and a hint of fresh ginger. The mouth offers riper, more oaky flavors of toasted nuts and pear flesh that lead through to the finish. Well balanced and easy to drink; so approachable, an excellent choice for outdoor summer dining with company.",Reserve,86,16.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Chardonnay,Osprey's Dominion
91359,New Zealand,"Although the aromas are marked by a prominent flinty, struck-match character, the flavors are fresh and clean, revolving around the tropical duo of passion fruit and pineapple.

91362,Chile,"A bold and chunky customer with multiple personalities. The nose has big black fruit, smoke, leather, barrel char and even some wet dog smells, while the palate is easygoing and full, with herbal, roasted fruit and spice. Long and mostly true on the finish. Uncomplicated but solid.",Casillero del Diablo Reserve,86,12.0,Rapel Valley,,,Malbec,Concha y Toro
91363,France,Very sweet aromas of ripe red and white cherries and canned peaches belie this wine's dry palate while the shortish finish shows an appealing citrusy crispness.

91364,Argentina,"Not short on intensity but it is a little candied and gummy on the nose. It remains somewhat jammy in the mouth, with a mild creaminess softening up edgy red berry flavors. Good but candied and basic.",Reserve,86,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Cruz Alta
91365,Italy,"This 70-30 blend of Chardonnay and Trebbiano is driven by a strong mineral vein that imparts dusty notes of slate, vitamin and granite over fuller aromas of exotic fruit and peach.

91367,Argentina,"A little bit baked, but overall it's a good, semirich Malbec with roasted, dark fruit flavors and a backdrop of chocolate.

91368,Argentina,"Dense, soupy and a little raisiny, with an overripe quality to the nose. Jammy in the mouth, but on the palate things unwind and improve.

91372,US,"The climate of New Mexico seems to suit the Viognier grape. Here it has given it a lovely, intense perfume of gardenia, orange blossom and guava.

91376,New Zealand,"This wine—a blend of steel-fermented and barrel-fermented lots—hides the oak well, displaying nicely pure melon, pear and citrus flavors that finish clean and refreshing.

91381,Spain,"Quite ripe on the nose, such that raisin and sweetness are front and center. Saturated in the mouth, but as a whole it's a bit flabby and, for the most part, it's neither here nor there.

91383,Spain,"After an initial blast of earth and lettuce, this Cabernet finds some of its fruity essence.

91390,Israel,"Moderate aromas of burnt coffee, cocoa dustings, black plum and berries lead into a similarly confectioned mouth loaded with sweet spice and chocolate-covered dried cherries. Solidly structured, but the 10 months spent in 90% American oak is a tad too apparent and somewhat overwhelms the palate.",Estate Bottled Kosher,84,19.0,Negev Hills,,,Merlot,Kadesh Barnea

91418,US,"Soft and approachable, this seems more like a generic red than a pure Cabernet Sauvignon. It's quite ripe, ready to drink, and certainly smooth. What is not there is any particular varietal character or sense of place. This is a medium-bodied red that could be from anywhere.",Arbitrage,87,49.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Market Vineyards
91419,Italy,"This Roero benefits from an added layer of spice, clove and cinnamon that sits tight over floral notes and wild berries (a tiny percent of Barbera is added to the blend).

91420,Chile,"Clean and ripe, with apple, pear and zesty citrus aromas.

Drink immediately.",Classic Series,87,12.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Montes
91421,Chile,"An aggressive, forward, high-acid wine with a lot of quality as well. The nose mixes dried cheese, leather, heat and savory red fruit aromas, while the palate rides a tight line of acidity toward angular raspberry and cherry flavors. Very zesty, tart and lively, but also deep in terms of minerality, freshness and potency. Drink now through 2012.",Edición Limitada,87,22.0,Loncomilla Valley,,,Carignan,Morandé
91422,US,"From the dark color, plummy aroma and heavy mouthfeel, you know this is a big, ponderous Pinot Noir. Nothing light or silky about it.

91427,Lebanon,"The Jeune Red from Château Musar's second line (formerly labeled Musar Cuvée Rouge) is a blend of Cinsault, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon that smells sweetly of ripe black cherries with rustic herbal and earthy notes. It opens softly with sweet blackberries and a hint of green bramble, but is chased by a mid-palate of fairly aggressive tannins and acidity. Fermented and aged in concrete vats, the Musar Jeune is completely unoaked and intended for early consumption, but would probably do nicely with some bottle aging as well.",Jeune Red,87,20.0,Bekaa Valley,,,Red Blend,Château Musar

91429,US,"A little soft in texture, but interesting for its mosaic of blackberry, pepper, smoked meat, currant and balsam flavors, and the way the firm tannins provide structure.

91430,Chile,"Dark, fruity and common in every way, but sometimes that's all you need.

Totally drinkable and likable.",Estate Bottled,87,8.0,Lontué Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Korta
91431,US,"There's so much raspberry, cherry, cola, clove, cinnamon and pepper flavor in this wine, it's hard to know where to begin. It's also dry, with smoky, vanilla oak notes.

91438,US,"There's no oak in this dry, crisp, clean white wine. It shows the tangy citrus, green grass, vanilla and spice flavors you want in a nice Sauvignon Blanc, with just a touch of gooseberry.

91440,Argentina,"A chunky style of SB with apple and green melon aromas. The palate is a bit soft and mealy, while the flavors revolve mostly around lemon.

91452,Argentina,"Roasted cherry and rubber aromas comprise the nose. The mouth has sharp acidity, which causes tang and zestiness to go with standard blackberry and dark plum flavors.

The wine is tonic and clean with a touch of sweetness on the close that could stand up to quiche Lorraine.,Chiaretto,86,13.0,Veneto,Bardolino Classico,,Rosé,Marchesini
91685,France,"Soft and lush, this wine opens with papaya, honey and pear underpinning a spicy top note. It's not quite as complex in the mouth, and noticeably off-dry. A good choice with fruit salad. Drink now.",Rosenberg,86,25.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Domaine Ehrhart
91686,France,"There are plenty of dry tannins here, dominating light red berry and hedgerow fruits. It is never going to be a big wine, but the tannins should soften in a year to leave a fresh, fruity wine.",,86,47.0,Burgundy,Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Jayer-Gilles
91687,France,"An exquisitely pretty wine, with green apple and white cherry fruit shot through with an intriguing cardamon note. The finish is crisp and dry with hints of lemon and Turkish figs. Perfect for warm weather entertaining.",Les Domaniers de Puits Mouret,86,19.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,,Rosé,Domaines Ott
91688,France,"A moderate-weight, citrus-infused Chard with soft green apple and dandelion floral accents. A crisp, clean finish and medium acidity makes this an excellent choice for warm weather sipping.",,86,14.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Vin de Pays d'Oc,,Chardonnay,Domaine de Fonfile
91689,US,"Sweeter smelling than the usual Chard, with peach preserves, lychee, pear and pink florals unfolding in the bouquet. The mouth offers more oak-driven balance, with notes of cedar plank and spiced pears filling the cream-textured mouth. Seals the deal with a lingering, toasty finish.",Reserve,86,18.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Chardonnay,Harbes Family Vineyard
91690,US,"Shows a nice, Alsatian-style balance between off-dry and dry, with crisp acidity framing citrus, pear, vanilla and candied ginger flavors. Clean and zesty, it's a fine cocktail sipper.",Klindt Vineyard Estate Grown,86,17.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Gris,Claudia Springs
91691,Argentina,"Robust up front, with bacony aromas mixed with leather, violet, pickle and blackberry. The palate is crisp and racy, with a fresh, acic-driven profile that's dotted with raspberry and blackberry. Has its share of flare but also some heat and unabsorbed acidity.",Reservado,86,16.0,Mendoza Province,San Carlos,,Malbec,Carlos Basso
91692,US,"Tastes super-jammy and extracted in cherries and raspberries, and pretty oaky, too, with a veneer of vanilla and charred wood. But it somehow lacks the structure to support all this richness. Feels a little flabby, and not likely to age well.",Edna Ranch 1772,86,46.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Tolosa
91693,US,"Ripeness is both this wine's blessing and its challenge. It's super-fruit in jammy blackberries, blueberries, currants and cherries, brightened by that famous Edna Valley acidity. But it's all on the surface, without much complexity. So drink now.",Estate Edna Ranch,86,24.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Tolosa
91694,Italy,"This rosé opens with a bright, saturated pink color and although the nose is rather neutral, the wine does deliver a clean and full texture that could pair with most summer dishes or lightly fried calamari. There's a touch of both sweetness and piquant spice on the close.",Cerasuolo,86,10.0,Central Italy,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Cerasuolo,,Rosé,Talamonti
91695,Chile,"Try as we might to rally around this four-grape blend, things just aren't coming together. The nose is dry, cheesy and loses clarity with exposure to air, and while it's juicy and lively, it's also a common type of wine with high acidity and a spiky feel. The blend is 80% Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc and 20% Carignan and Carmenère.",Suyai,86,40.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Red Blend,Terra Andina
91696,Chile,"Spunky and sweet smelling, with a touch of stemmy pepper to the nose. The palate is narrow but fruity, with your standard allotment of zesty red fruit flavors along with mellow spice. Finishes short, with drying tannins. Good but lacks nuance and sophistication.",Clava,86,13.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Pinot Noir,Quintay
91697,France,"Although this wine is missing the seductive nose of many Gewürztraminers, it is impressive in the mouth with a rich texture and intense notes of rose water and cloves. Slight residual sugar and soft acidity make it a good partner for seafood in a fruit-based preparation.",Réserve,86,21.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Pierre Sparr
91698,Chile,"Starts with young, bouncy, foxy aromas and then settles on berry fruit and bacon fat.

A sweet wine with adequate richness and reasonably true Cabernet qualities.",Reserva,86,10.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Carolina

91700,US,"Sweeter, more developed aromas of caramel, candied red apple, Boston baked beans and honeydew develop on the nose, while the mouth shows more typical Chard notes of baked apple and hazelnut butter. A touch round and flabby, but ends with a long, delicious, vanilla-kissed finish.",,86,15.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay,Rooster Hill
91701,Italy,There's a strong note of chopped mint or peppermint that sets this wine apart from most other rosés on the market. The wine is tart and slightly sweet in the mouth and would pair with lamb kebab and mint sauce or hummus and fried pita chips.,Rosato,86,13.0,Southern Italy,Salento,,Rosé,Masseria Altemura
91702,US,"Very tough in tannins now, and bone dry, but it's not showing the richness you want for it to survive time in the cellar. Some modest blackberry flavors, which turn into black currants and cocoa toward the finish, relieve the austerity. But it doesn't seem likely to improve.",Tomasson Vineyard,86,40.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Midsummer Cellars
91703,Chile,"Sweet basic cherry aromas are candied at first and then darker with airing. The palate is bold, juicy, a little aggressive and herbal, with ample berry and plum fruit at the base. Oaky and long on the finish, with a peppery, herbal ending.",Reserva,86,14.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Carmenère,Viu Manent
91704,France,The nose of Concord grapes is immediately appealing and leads to notes of overripe raspberries. Substantial residual sugar in combination with medium acidity render this a good for pool-side sipping or with paté.,Réserve,86,15.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Willm
91705,France,"Soft red apple, white peach and delicate white florals unfold in the nose, while toastier notes of baked apple and brioche appear in the mouth.

91706,New Zealand,"A bit of a letdown coming from this producer, the Kidnapper's Vineyard Chardonnay seems to lack some richness and flesh in the midpalate. It's otherwise appealing for its pear, melon and graphite notes and crisp finish.",C3 Kidnappers Vineyard,85,20.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Chardonnay,Craggy Range
91707,Chile,"Fresh and green-fruited, with mildly sweet, talcum powder aromas. Turns more stark in the mouth, and toward sour apple and grapefruit. Fairly acidic, and thus more zesty than substantive. Lemony and sharp on the finish.",Reserva,85,11.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Chono
91708,Chile,"For a huge-volume wine, it's what we'd expect. Controlled oak results in aromas of coffee, vanilla, marshmallow and resin in addition to cassis and cherry, while the palate offers generic fruit flavors as well as vanilla and herbal notes. A bit puckery and scratchy, but keep in mind that annual production tops 1.3 million cases.",Casillero del Diablo Reserve,85,10.0,Central Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Concha y Toro
91709,US,"A good, everyday Pinot Noir. It's somewhat rugged, with jagged tannins, and the flavors are direct and simple, suggesting cherry jam and buttered cinnamon toast. But the silky texture is pure Pinot Noir.",Reserve,85,16.0,California,Sonoma County-Monterey County-Santa Barbara County,California Other,Pinot Noir,Angeline
91710,US,"A rare California sparkler made from the Riesling grape, and a pretty good one. It's slightly sweet, with very pretty flavors of oranges, vanilla, buttered toast and creamy lees. Good price for such a fancy sipper.",Riesling,87,16.0,California,California,California Other,Champagne Blend,Korbel
91711,US,"Good and dry, with very soft, refined tannins and complex flavors. Suffers a bit from arch acidity, but a nice steak should balance it. The delicious flavors include blackberry and cherry jam, licorice, charred meat and a hefty dose of freshly crushed black pepper.",,87,24.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Jorian Hill
91712,France,"Dry, yes, but this wine is also soft and ripe. It has an attractive toasty character giving power to the midpalate. It's in the finish that the real acidity and dryness show most.",Extra Brut,87,52.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Mailly Grand Cru
91713,Italy,"Aromas of wild berry, floral notes and light spice shadings make for a very nice balance. The wine is tannic, dry and raw in the mouth. It should be paired with melted chèvre cheese on baguette.",Betlemme,87,,Piedmont,Roero,,Nebbiolo,Bricco del Prete
91714,US,"Oak and superripe fruit collaborate to make this wine taste like a fruity granola bar, with raspberries, blackberries, roasted almonds, caramel and cinnamon spices. It's a bit obvious now, too young and fresh for subtlety, especially at this price. Could develop nuances over time. Give it 5–6 years and try again.",Les Rocheuses Reserve,87,90.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bugay
91715,Chile,"Heady, tight, piercing aromas are a good indication of the wine's style and sense of attack. The palate is firm, acidic and driving but ultimately more basic and generic than individual or exciting. It's tangy and focuses on raspberry and peppery qualities. Good and structured but also tight.",Cenit,87,,Colchagua Valley,,,Red Blend,Caliterra
91716,US,"Mainly Sauvignon Blanc, with 18% Sémillon, this is a very fruity young wine. It brims with Meyer lemon, pineapple, pear, peach, apricot and lime flavors, but is rescued from being a fruit bomb by crisp acidity and a nice minerality. There's just a touch of sweet oak for richness.",Hay Hook,87,18.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,Farrier
91717,US,"This is a brisk, dry and zesty Gewürztraminer that shows how well the variety performs in Mendocino's Anderson Valley. It shows the super-spiciness of Gewürz, with tropical fruit and honeysuckle flavors balanced with crisp acidity.",,87,20.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Gewürztraminer,Foursight
91718,US,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon was aged in a 50/50 mix of French and American oak. It is still quite astringent, tannic, and herbal, needing more bottle age to meld the somewhat harsh barrel flavors. The tart fruit flavors combine rhubarb and raspberries, black cherry and cassis.",,87,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Glencorrie

91720,US,"A gigantically flavored wine, massive in pineapple, guava and apricot flavors, liberally accented with 65% new French oak. Although it's dry, it may even have a touch of botrytis, to judge from the honeyed concentration.

91722,Italy,"Blangé is a supremely clean and pristine white wine to drink as an aperitivo or with fresh salads or seafood.

The wine is fresh, crisp and tonic throughout.",Blangé,87,27.0,Piedmont,Langhe,,Arneis,Ceretto

91724,Lebanon,"Unoaked and intended for earlier consumption, the Musar Cuvée Blanc is the uncomplicated, easy-to-drink younger sibling of the idiosynractic Lebanese winery's more austere Château line. A blend of Chardonnay, Viognier and Vermentino, the wine has aromas of bruised apples on the nose, but plenty of fresh apple and pear on the palate with bright acidity and a stony, mineral profile. It's a balanced wine with pleasant astringency on the palate and an herbaceous character throughout.",Cuvée Blanc,87,20.0,Bekaa Valley,,,White Blend,Château Musar
91725,Italy,This luscious Barbera d'Asti shows plump aromas of black cherry and blackberry backed by lighter tones of spice and tobacco.

91727,US,"Here's a soft, high alcohol, slightly hot Zin, lacking in acidity. What it lacks in structure, it more than makes up for in sheer, exuberant taste.

91729,US,"This expensive Cabernet isn't showing well now. It's all fruit and no subtlety. Offers wave after wave of blackberries, cherries, plums, currants, chocolate and licorice, and feels so soft, it could almost be from Paso Robles. Hard to predict its future.",,87,90.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vin Roc

91731,US,"The addition of Viognier in the blend is enough to make this Syrah feel tartly acidic and strangely bright in citrus fruits. The limes almost swamp Syrah's underlying cherry-berry and currant flavors. It's a good, bold wine, but an adventurous anomaly for a varietal Syrah. Drink it now.",Four Bottle Especial,87,40.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,Silver
91732,US,"Here's a rich Chardonnay notable for plenty of fruit, and also for brisk acidity.

91733,US,"Somewhat rugged, with edgy tannins, but very flavorful, a nice wine to have with Italian-inspired pasta dishes.

91737,US,"Clean, fresh and simple, this does not claim to be “unoaked” but it carries that style in its flavors, a snappy mix of green apple, pineapple and grapefruit. Good everyday drinking.",Traditions,87,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Milbrandt
91738,US,"Nice and dry, with fine, firm tannins. Quite a good wine, but kind of one-dimensional, with ripe red cherry purée and oak flavors that don't develop beyond that in the mouth. Shows the risks when you depend on 100% Cabernet Franc to make a complete wine.",Estate,87,51.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Franc,White Cottage Ranch

91740,Georgia,"A winemaking history in a bottle, this Georgian wine made from Rkatsiteli grapes is an unusual peek into techniques tracing back 8,000 years. Deep gold in color due to an extended maceration on grape skins, this wine was aged in buried clay vessels, then oak, giving it a smoky, earthy profile with notes of butterscotch and roasted nut skins. There's not a lot of acidity, but it's refreshing with pretty orange peel notes and a grape tannin astringency on the finish.",Satrapezo 10 Kvevri,84,35.0,Kakheti,,,Rkatsiteli,Telavi
91741,Georgia,"Aged in buried clay vessels in accordance with ancient Georgian winemaking techniques, then transferred to new oak, there's a core of bright cherry fruit, coffee grinds and vanilla on the nose and palate of this unique Saperavi. It's a good wine, but charred wood, jagged tannins and hints of barnyard tend to obscure all the lovely fruit.",Satrapezo,84,40.0,Kakheti,,,Saperavi,Telavi

91746,Argentina,"Smells sweet and artificial, with chemical notes and overwrought vanilla. Juicy in the mouth, with flesh and freshness. But the flavors are oaky, so much so that the wine's citrus and apple quality is masked. Finishes with grapefruit and bitterness. Weird and all over the map.",Don Nicanor,84,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay-Viognier,Nieto Senetiner

91751,Argentina,"Opens with warm, baked black fruit aromas and then a wave of woodiness takes control.

91757,US,"A nice, citrusy nose suggests lemon and orange hard candy. With alcohol at just 11%, residual sugar is around 2%, which softens the acids but gives the mouthfeel an odd flatness. Drink up.",,84,9.0,Washington,Rattlesnake Hills,Columbia Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Silver Lake
91758,US,"A little rough and common in the mouth, with jagged tannins and some green peppercorn flavors. But for the price, it's fruity enough in raspberries and cherries, making it a good buy. Production was nearly 100,000 cases.",,84,8.0,California,California,California Other,Merlot,Smoking Loon
91759,Argentina,"While I generally like and sometimes even love the Cobos wines, this Merlot underwhelms. The nose is reedy and stemmy, with earthy, herbal raspberry aromas.

91761,US,"A hard wine to like. It's very dry and somewhat overripe, with a pruny, raisiny edge, and the acidity sticks out in a harsh way.

91775,Italy,"Sassello is an extremely well integrated wine with deep aromas of black cherry, forest berry, chocolate fudge and leather.

91776,France,"An intriguing blend of Négrette, Syrah and Malbec, this wine is a selection of the best lots of the vintage. It has purity of blackberry fruit, edged with an earthy, barnyard character. It is ripe, generous, but not overweight.",Le Bouissel,91,26.0,Southwest France,Fronton,,Red Blend,Château Bouissel

91779,France,"With a little extra bottle age, this wine shows great charm and style.

91959,Italy,"There are distant floral notes here, but in general this blend of Trebbiano and Vermentino from Grosseto, Tuscany seems initially closed. Perfumed aromas of jasmine and honeysuckle do burst through from time to time and the wine is crisp and snappy on the close.",Cuccallegro,85,,Tuscany,Montecucco,,White Blend,Piandibugnano

91961,Argentina,"Pretty well composed on the nose, with a core of blackberry. The palate runs narrow and grabby, but the generic sweet berry fruit is tasty, albeit ultrasimple.

91963,Chile,"So lean, green and austere that it's almost a ghost. The nose is kind of vegetal more than fruity, while the acidity is so staunch that it penetrates the tongue membrane and sizzles a bit. Flavors of lime and sour apple lead to an acidic, tart finish. Needs more than just crispness.",Ventolera,85,14.0,Leyda Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Viña Litoral

Should be drunk up in a year or two.",Prestige,85,14.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Cave de Ribeauvillé

91971,US,"Fruit is both the hero and the villain of this Cabernet.

92050,Argentina,"Yellow in color, blowsy on the nose, and chunky to the max in the mouth. This wine is big, forced and heavy, with orange, banana and melon flavors. Finishes soft and with no discernible oak or elegance.",Natal,83,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Alpamanta
92051,Bulgaria,"A curious bouquet of lemongrass, pine needles and green florals, this Bulgarian Traminer boasts pretty floral scents and flavors accented with notes of apple and lemon. The dry, medium-bodied palate is a bit dusty, however, with an abrasive acidity on the finish.",,83,10.0,Bulgaria,,,Traminer,Targovishte
92052,Hungary,"Lifted apple and pear aromas accent this light-bodied Tokaji with characteristic honey sweetness and a bright, citrus acidity.

92054,Argentina,"Aromas of mealy apple and citrus are less than inviting, while the palate is citrusy but lacking in true Chardonnay character; instead it shows odd flavors of ham and orange juice. Ranks as yet another uninspired Argentine Chard in a long line of such wines.",,83,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Zorzal
92055,Argentina,"Dark and heavily extracted, with a big, rubbery, gaseous bouquet that foretells the rest of the wine, which is herbal and full-bodied, with baked plum and berry flavors. Finishes oaky, with drying tannins and heat.",Reserve,83,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Noir,Zorzal
92056,Spain,"Quite strange and funky smelling, with uncommon grass, floral, hickory and blueberry aromas. The palate feels fine but has a sweet, faux-weedy core flavor that's offset by candied berry flavors. Tastes of licorice and lactic creaminess on the finish.",Rojo Granrojo,83,9.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Bodegas Navarro López
92057,US,"Too soft for comfort, and too sweet, although the softness may exaggerate the true sugar content. Either way, this simple wine has cloying, candied blackberry and mocha flavors.",Special Reserve,83,38.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Herzog
92058,Slovenia,"While savory and smoky on the nose with subdued aromas of apple and pineapple, this dry yet fruity Furmint from Slovenia offers a host of bright tropical flavors.

92061,Georgia,"Powdered sugar and lifted lemon scents mark this blend of traditional Georgian white grapes. The off-dry, charmat method produced wine is a bit more aggressive on the palate than Bagrationi's méthode Champenoise counterparts, but a value alternative to Prosecco.",Classic Extra Dry,83,10.0,Georgia,,,Sparkling Blend,Bagrationi 1882
92062,Argentina,"Neutral on the nose except for a spot of peach and citrus. The palate is soft and chunky, with generic citrus flavors that suggest passion fruit and grapefruit. Turns a little mealy on the finish, so drink ASAP.",,83,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Bodega Norton

92065,Argentina,"Forward and simple, with red fruit and citrus on the nose. The palate is lean and light bodied, with tangy, dry red fruit flavors, orange and sour sucking candy.

92069,Spain,"Funky and smelling of pine and tarragon. That aromatic sharpness carries straight to the palate, where the feel is narrow and the flavors are short and tangy, with little to no big-time berry fruit. Simply an acceptable underperformer that's tough and sharp.",Barrica,83,19.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Finca La María
92070,Australia,"Impressively textured for such an inexpensive Shiraz, Mitolo's 2007 Jester is a concentrated, slightly smoky, black-olive laced wine. Briny, smoky, savory notes would pair well with herbed leg of lamb. Drink now–2015.",Jester,90,23.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Mitolo

92075,France,"The concentration that Christian Roche produces here is immense, a wine that has dark tannins, the most bitter of chocolate flavors and peppered cherry fruits.

Age for 3–4 years more.",L'Extase,90,30.0,Southwest France,Côtes de Bergerac,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Domaine l'Ancienne Cure
92076,US,"A richly satisfying Bordeaux blend that needs a little time to soften and mellow. Right now, it's tight in tannins and filled with strong, primary fruit flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and cocoa. The toasty oak is kind of all by itself. But the structure is clean and elegant. Give it until late 2010 to meld.",,90,36.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Meritage,Calcareous

92078,Italy,"Fresh berry nuances come on the heels of spice, chocolate and smoke. The wild berry presence is nicely defined and gives this Vino Nobile a fresh and youthful disposition.

92079,US,"This is a big, somewhat heavy Pinot Noir in its youth. It has the weight of a Grenache, with furry tannins housing flavors of red and black cherries, red currants and mocha. It's quite a good wine, but juvenile. Give it 2–3 years in the cellar, and it should glide through 2014 or so.",Ramal Vineyard,90,50.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell

92081,Austria,"A wine that pairs with Gesellmann's Bela Rex Bordeaux blend. In Op (short for Opus) Eximium, Austrian grapes provide a delicious spice confection of wild fruits, expertly blended into an intense dark berry- and vanilla-flavored wine.

92084,France,"A big, burly, rich wine, with the Tannat tannins only just tamed by the ripe black spicy fruit.

It is worth aging for 2–3 years.",Madiran Laplace,90,15.0,Southwest France,Madiran,,Tannat-Cabernet,Château d'Aydie
92085,France,"The wine is textured, layered with minerality, green apple skins, peppered pears and acidity. It is very young, a work in progress as the wood integrates with the fruit.

92086,Austria,"Serious levels of wood run through this impressive wine, but never to the loss of the red fruits. There are hints of beetroot, layers of red plum juice, cranberry and acidity.

92091,US,"Very ripe and jammy in raspberry and cherry fruit flavors, this Pinot is accented with crisp acidity. Oak barrel aging adds notes of caramel and buttered toast.

92098,US,"Ryan Patrick's reserve is pure Cabernet Sauvignon, though not labeled as such. It's a barrel selection, and very well done, with a purity and density that is most expressive.

92101,US,"The Rock Star Red is a 50/50 Cabernet/Syrah blend. The two grapes work well together in many wines, but here they seem a bit at odds. The Cabernet carries some green, herbal, pickle barrel flavors; the Syrah brings in pepper and spice, but neither has the ripeness to flesh out the wine sufficiently.

92105,Spain,"Aromas of pine, rubber and rhubarb are austere, and so is the rest of the wine. The palate is run by acidity, which is sharp and scouring. Flavors are tart and underdone, with pie cherry and red raspberry. Sheering but admittedly cleansing, with surprising sourness.",Capricho,85,20.0,Northern Spain,Calatayud,,Garnacha,Cruz de Piedra

92231,Portugal,"Approaching tawny in color, this is a mature white Port. It has a wood-aged tang, with spice and toast flavors that have given the wine an old gold feel. The surface is sweet, yet there is an underlying dryness.",10-Years Old White,91,61.0,Port,,,Port,Cálem
92232,Argentina,"Spunky right off the bat, this has floral and fresh fruit aromas that fall squarely into the wild berry category. It feels lively on the palate, with spiked acidity but enough weight and depth to absorb it. This tastes like a mix of plum, blackberry and chocolate, and the finish darkens up with notes of pepper and spice. Drink now–2017.",Privada,91,30.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Norton
92233,Italy,"This blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah shows a decadently soft side thanks to its aromas of black cherry, tobacco, chocolate and subtle spice. It delivers density and substance on the finish and would pair with pasta and creamy porcini sauce.",Cum Laude,91,31.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Castello Banfi
92234,France,"This blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Syrah and 20% Mourvèdre delivers juicy, almost gulpable fruit, supported by a loose spine of soft tannins.

92235,France,"This is Les Vins de Vienne's upscale Crozes, and it's very successful in 2009, featuring bold, concentrated blackberry fruit supported by hints of vanilla and toast.

92236,France,"Chapoutier has fashioned a full-bodied, creamy-textured 2009 Le Bernardine, with dark, plummy fruit and a hint of chocolate liqueur that ably reflect the warm vintage. Yet despite all of the lushness, the wine doesn't come across as heavy or overdone, making it attractive for early drinking. Try now–2018.",Le Bernardine,91,56.0,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,,Rhône-style Red Blend,M. Chapoutier

It's not an ager, but shows plenty of class.",Grand Reserve,91,28.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kendall-Jackson
92238,US,"This still immature Pinot has tobacco-infused cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors that are liberally oaked and spiced.

92239,Italy,"Ser Gioveto is 80% Sangiovese with small additions of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.

There's a jammy accent in the bouquet that gives momentum to its rich, velvety mouthfeel.",Ser Gioveto,91,50.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Rocca delle Macìe
92240,France,"If the oak integrates better and recedes more into the fruit than I suspect, this rating will look conservative. Right now, oak is front and center, arrayed in ranks of toasted cedar and vanilla. It's full bodied and chewy in texture, with a long, plushly oaky finish. Try after 2015.",Domaine de Roure,91,80.0,Rhône Valley,Crozes-Hermitage,,Syrah,Paul Jaboulet Aîné
92241,US,"Here's a Cabernet to lay down in the cellar for 6–8 years—or even longer. Two things mark it: the extremely ripe, concentrated blackberry and black currant fruit, and the hefty tannins. Most people will probably open it too soon and miss out on what it could be, when the tannins drop out to reveal its sweet fruity essence.",Le Roi Soleil,91,65.0,California,Mount Veeder,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Y Rousseau
92242,Mexico,"This red blend of 67% Syrah and 33% Mourvedre immediately announces itself as serious and classy.

92244,France,"The blend is 70% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 10% Carignan, and in 2009 the grapes were as ripe as they could be. Mocha and chocolate notes pick up a touch of prune. With its superripe fruit, ample weight, lush texture and warm finish, there are valid concerns about its ageability, but this offers hedonistic drinking for an affordable price.",El Niño Loco,91,17.0,France Other,Vin de Pays de la Méditerranée,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Guillaume Gros
92245,US,"The winery strikes a happy balance between richness and elegant austerity with this bone-dry offering. It's minerally and reserved, offering intriguing hints of apricots and tropical fruits, with notes of buttered toast and smoky vanilla of new oak that many Chardonnay lovers crave.

92248,Portugal,"This is an austere wine that blossoms slowly. Using grapes sourced from a vineyard at an elevation of 2,000 feet, this has a wild herb character along with dark black fruits and tannins that need several years to age. Give this very ageworthy effort at least four years.",Quinta do Cardo Selecção do Enólogo,91,16.0,Beira Interior,,,Portuguese Red,Companhia das Quintas
92249,US,"As delicious as Pinot Noir gets, this has fireworks of raspberries, cherries and cola, and a sweet, mushroom-like essence of earth. Then the depth kicks in.

Mildly medicinal and candied, but good overall.",120,85,8.0,Central Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Rita
92255,Chile,"Silly name and label, but not a bad wine. The nose is meaty, medicinal and fails to hold its form over extended airing, but early on it's good and honest, as is the palate of herbal tomato and cassis flavors. A little bit scrappy, but for $10 it's better than most.",,85,10.0,Central Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sassy Bitch

92261,Italy,"Here's a Sauvignon Blanc (with 15% Chardonnay) from a warm Italian climate (Cortona, Tuscany) that offers broad and thick aromas of passionfruit, peach and a touch of mango.

92267,France,"This wine makes you work harder than many of its neighbors to find the flavor but it's worth the effort when you uncover an intriguing mélange of hay, apricot and early summer fruits.

92271,Chile,"A bit foxy and jumpy at first, and then familiar aromas of berry and plum settle in. The palate is jammy and tannic, while flavors of berries and currants seem roasted. Tobacco and olive notes are present on the chewy, weighty, textured finish.",Reserva,85,12.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Porta
92272,Argentina,"Pungent and a little pickled on the nose, with oak and cream coming on a second wave. The palate is composed, normal in feel and shows slightly choppy cherry and berry flavors. Regular but short on the finish. Good wine; nothing more than that.",,85,13.0,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,Ombu
92273,Chile,"A dark, chunky wine with cola, cassis and beet-like aromas. The palate is extracted but gritty, with big blackberry fruit that doesn't change or improve in the mouth.

92277,Chile,"The bouquet is arguably the best part: earthy berry fruit mixed with tobacco and leather. The palate, meanwhile, is fairly hard and clipped, with short cherry and berrry flavors in front of a fast-moving, tough finish. Not a bad wine but tough on the tongue.",Winemaker's Collection,85,15.0,Maule Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,Simone

92295,US,"Tastes a bit raw and herbal in the mouth, like a piece of celery, although there are also richer blackberry and cherry flavors. Yet it's a dry, elegantly constructed Cabernet. Best soon, before the fruit disappears.",,86,52.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jordan
92296,Chile,"Tropical and more blunt and citric than previous vintages. At first blush, it's borderline sheering and sharp, but with time it mellows and settles on pungent grapefruit and citrus flavors. Predominantly it's about zest and power; not as balanced as prior bottlings.",Cariblanco,86,16.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Kingston Family
92297,US,"This fruity Petite Sirah has jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, plums, currants and bacon, dusted with cocoa and black pepper.

92298,US,"A delicious Petite Sirah, packed with richness.

92299,Chile,"Smells like a mix of leather, olive paste and sea foam along with bold berries. The palate is saturated and layered, with thick blackberry and full, herbal accents.

92307,Bulgaria,"Herbaceous notes of dill and green wood converge with ripe, sweet plum and spice aromas on this medium-bodied, bargain Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon.

92309,US,"This spent almost a year in mostly neutral oak, and has softened into a wine loaded with lemony, peachy fruit, so thick as to seem almost syrupy in the mouth.

92317,Spain,"Fairly flat on the nose, and also innocuous on the palate. Flavors of green melon and nectarine are modest at best, and while the mouthfeel is decent, the overall character of the wine isn't that exciting. Finishes pithy, citric and mealy.

92321,Spain,"Clean plum and berry is the opening act, but after initial black-fruit and spice aromas there is only an underdeveloped set of flavors that run sassy, sour and stretched.

92322,Spain,"Color and mouthfeel are the highlights of this exceedingly green wine. Try as we might to figure out why, this is one of the more vegetal wines we've tried from Rioja. It's green-bean city on the nose, and the flavor profile is dominated by tomato, herbs and bell pepper. Think 1990s Chilean Merlot, early Super Tuscans or New Zealand Cabernet and you will know what we mean by “green.”",Inspiración Valdemar Colección Varietales,83,65.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Valdemar

92330,Spain,"Cambra's wines all seem sheer and tannic. This blend of Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc is funky at first, with clamshell, cheese and sweat aromas.

92332,Israel,"It seems that this wine has seen better days, and probably had a bit more life and zest when it was first released.

92372,US,"Nice now at 5–plus years in the bottle, with fully resolved tannins making the wine softly creamy in the mouth.

92417,US,"Despite the reserve and late harvest designations, this fits in more comfortably with a standard, off-dry Washington Riesling.

The mixed berries, red licorice, cherries, layers of butterscotch, toffee and caramel are beautifully integrated and linger seductively into the finish. It has some initial alcoholic heat, but the flavors compensate and go on and on. This is a wine that must be cellared another five or more years before it even begins to pull itself together.

Lemon peel, candied pineapple and even grapefruit add lovely grace notes indicative of rich, clean, natural acids and a wine with plenty of glycerin.

It shows massive flavors of red currants, cherry pie filling, cola, figs and spices that taste like they were baked into a dessert pastry, except that the finish is thoroughly dry.

92449,France,"The purity of this wine is impressive. It has a straight line of mineral, flint and grapefruit running through it. Around this, there are layers of fresh apples, lime zest and a tight, taut structure. The one downside to what is a fine wine is that it, like many Roederer vintages, is too young. Give it 4–5 years.",Blanc de Blancs Brut,95,70.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Louis Roederer

This is a classic.",Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs Brut,95,,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Taittinger
92453,US,"The first sniff and taste tell you this is an important wine, but also a very young, tannic one. It's the structure, and not just the ripe flavors, that's so impeccable, giving the wine its backbone and strength. But speaking of flavors, the wine is gigantic in black currants and blackberries.

92499,Spain,"What a monster this is. Aromas of roasted meat, compost, leather, berry and plum give it a rugged bouquet, while the superripe palate is big as sin and loaded with ultrasweet blackberry, soy and peppery flavors.

92685,US,"There's a bubble-gummy, almost Beaujolais quality to this Pinot, which spent 15 months in 3/4 new French oak. It's rude now, with oaky, grapey flavors of black raspberry marmalade and Dr. Pepper cola. While it's dry and crisp and interesting, it's awkward. Is it an ager?

92689,France,"From selected parcels of the Bélingard vineyard, this is a firm and rich wine, with excellent concentration. The tannins are firm, dusty, broken by ripe plums and sweet acidity.

At first sniff it explodes into life, the aromas a mix of herb, spice, tar, smoke, earth and fruit.

A middle-tier Cab in every way.",Estate,85,14.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Errazuriz
92851,New Zealand,"This oak-free Chardonnay starts off with somewhat floral and spicy aromas, then delivers an assertive mouthful of fruit cocktail-like flavors. It's medium-bodied, just right as an apéritif or alongside simply grilled fish or chicken.",Unoaked,85,15.0,East Coast,,,Chardonnay,Gunn Estate
92852,New Zealand,"Tart and citrusy, with distinct lemon and pineapple components that finish crisp and slightly musky. Fine as an apéritif or with light seafood. Drink now.",Unoaked,85,15.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Chardonnay,Curious Cove
92853,Chile,"Candied but also peppery and herbal, and without much depth or complexity. The palate is tight, acidic, sheering and tastes of snappy, edgy cherry and raspberry fruit. Then an oaky, vanilla dryness sets in. Solid and fresh, but hardly a head-turner.",Reserva,85,16.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Merlot,Carmen
92854,US,"Barrel fermented and aged in American oak for 15 months, this is a big and powerfully oaky Chard with dominating notes of butter, wood-infused stone fruit and apple pie along with a hint of grapefruit oil in the mouth. The finish is toasty  with a lingering vanilla bean note.",American Oak,85,20.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay,Casa Larga
92855,Chile,"As the production on this wine climbs (it's up to 35,000 cases now), the final product becomes more generic. An opening of bold berry fruit comes with a pounding mix of oaky vanilla and milk chocolate, while the palate has acidity for zest but also a lot of creamy oak. Very oaky on the finish, leaving a lasting impression that's more about resin and vanilla than fruit or individuality.",Marques de Casa Concha,85,21.0,Peumo,,,Merlot,Concha y Toro
92856,France,"Smoky, toasty aromas lead into a wine that brings some fruit tannins to the mix, with flavors of sweet plums and spice to go with the wood. The wine has some potential, perhaps for aging 2-3 years.",Buissonnier Rully,85,23.0,Burgundy,Rully,,Pinot Noir,Vignerons de Buxy
92857,France,"Chitry lies just outside the Chablis appellation area, giving a wine that has some of the classic steely character but is more rounded and less focused. Pleasing Chardonnay, finishes with an attractive vanilla touch.",Bourgogne Chitry,85,13.0,Burgundy,Bourgogne,,Chardonnay,Simonnet-Febvre
92858,Chile,"A ripe, sweet, soft style of Chardonnay that pours on the banana and pear aromas and flavors. The feel runs toward the valley, and the finish is all vanilla and sweet, melony fruit. Good enough but not all that lively.",Reserva,85,12.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Santa Rita
92859,Chile,"Generally speaking, Errazuriz's progressive wines hit their marks. But this Chard seems to be substituting oak for substance. The bouquet comes straight from the barrel, and the palate is resiny as it houses lemony, baked apple flavors. Finishes as woody as it began. Too much oak, plain and simple.",Wild Ferment,84,21.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Errazuriz
92860,France,"Pleasant, soft wine, easy to drink, its fruits round and somewhat dilute. It doesn't resonate, but is certainly fresh and crisp.",,84,45.0,Burgundy,Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Beaune,,Chardonnay,Domaine Jayer-Gilles
92861,US,"Aged 14 months in Russian Oak, this is a different kind of Chard with notes of chamomile, fresh mint sprigs, vanilla and cigar tobacco among the more typical melon fruits and lime citrus.

92863,US,"A little dainty on aromas with hints of nectarine, honeysuckle and licorice. The mouth is ripe and rich with notes of roasted red apple, orangey citrus and a touch of mealy stone fruit.

92864,US,"Soft and extractedly jammy in blackberry, cherry and chocolate fruit, this Syrah is simple. The absence of structure makes it taste sweeter than it technically is.",,84,16.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Syrah,Ancient Peaks

92867,Chile,"Dark purple in color, with a creamy, candied, berry fruit nose that's potent but not very stirring.

Also tannic and tough.",Reserve,84,14.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Ema
92868,France,"Soft and broad, a little unfocused, the fruit showing pear juice and green apple skins. It feels light, juicy, missing concentration, and there's a caramel toast aftertaste.",Buissonnier Côte Chalonnaise Chardonnay,84,18.0,Burgundy,Côte Chalonnaise,,Chardonnay,Vignerons de Buxy
92869,Chile,"Not a bad wine but definitely overoaked for what it is.

92873,Chile,"A sniff reveals somewhat cheesy, salinic red fruit aromas that struggle to keep their poise. The palate is fresh and forward, but it also smacks down with narrowing, hard tannins.

92874,Chile,"Jumbled aromas of grilled meat, asphalt and black cherry candy require patience and modest standards, while the palate is regular, a touch sticky and cloying, with sweet but generic berry fruit flavors. Dry and fairly snappy on the finish.",Estate Collection,84,9.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Merlot,Viu Manent
92875,France,"With prominent biscuit notes, this crémant announces its allegiance to the elegant Champagne style. It follows through with a fine mousse and a light impression in the mouth. A few pear and earth aroams peek through on the fleeting finish. Drink up.",Brut,84,20.0,Alsace,Crémant d'Alsace,,Chardonnay,Ehrhart
92876,Argentina,"Baked apple and buttercup aromas get it going in a good way, but the palate doesn't really keep the momentum. It's citrusy but low in acid, while the flavors are simple and narrow as they revolve around citrus fruits. Chunky and soft on the finish.",,84,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Four Aces
92877,France,"An interesting Chard that offers quite sweet notes of stewed peaches, orange marmalade and overripe honeydew. Big and a bit clumsy in the mouth, more vibrancy and freshness is needed to keep things in better balance.

92883,Chile,"Herbal from the beginning, with bell pepper, olive and brambly fruit aromas. Round and full in the mouth, with flavors of wild berry, green pepper, carob and spice.

92889,Chile,"A bit sharp and volatile at first, but with time the aromas mellow out to rest on black fruits and olive.

92890,US,"Shows classically exotic, rich Viognier flavors ranging from ripe citrus fruits through peaches and pears to tropical papayas, wildflowers and spices.

92897,Romania,"Although the nose on this medium-bodied Romanian blend of Pinot Noir, Merlot and Feteasca Neagra is pretty with ripe, black plums, vanilla and a hint of cashew nuts, it takes some airing out for the charred oak flavors to settle, allowing red plum and coffee grind notes to appear on the palate. Gripping tannins and high acidity give this wine a puckery astringency, but it's not bad for the bargain price.",Rosso di Valachia,85,10.0,Dealu Mare,,,Red Blend,Byzantium
92898,Italy,There's a pungent or slightly volatile note of fresh cedar or red apple that dominates this wine and leaves little room for the wine's natural complexity to show.

92905,Chile,"Over-the-top, starting with the aromas of nettle, sweat and grapefruit.

92916,US,"A perfect score has to be considered in the context of its region. Shafer's 2004 Hillside Select is tremendous as a Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon that competes with its peers at the highest levels. It's always a fabulous wine, but in warm 2004, Shafer's amphitheater vineyard sheltered the grapes, ripening them to perfection yet protecting the “iron fist in a velvet glove” structure that André Tchelistcheff defined as Stags Leap. This 100% Cabernet is tremendous in cassis, black currant and mocha flavors, and the 100% new French oak provides perfect additions of smoke and caramel.

92918,France,"At the time it was shown as a barrel sample in early 2007, this was the best wine of 2006. That accolade remains. It has all the power of the Cabernet Sauvignon in Pauillac, which was the greatest success of the vintage. That power comes from the dense tannins as well as the black plum and spice flavors and minerality. The texture becomes velvet, giving a final richness, but never losing its long aging potential. In a year that is good, but not at the top, Mouton has made a great wine.",,97,,Bordeaux,Pauillac,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Mouton Rothschild
92919,France,"Strength and elegance go together in this wine. It has a pure line of clear berry fruits that float above the tannic core. It is not so much rich as dense, the tannins a vivid counterpoint to the fruit. The wine finishes with fine, elegant sweetness, but it is the purity of line that stays in the memory. Age for 10 years at least.",,97,,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Ausone
92920,France,"After the fabulous 2005, Pétrus again has produced a magnificent wine in 2006, even if it doesn't hit quite the same heights.

Deceptively attractive, it will profit from many years' aging.",,96,,Bordeaux,Pessac-Léognan,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château La Mission Haut-Brion
92928,Austria,"As the Kracher wines gain in intensity, so they diminish in alcohol. The overwhelming richness is held in check by life-giving freshness.

The finish of honey lingers long.",Zwischen den Steen Nummer 9 Trockenbeerenauslese,96,103.0,Burgenland,,,Scheurebe,Kracher
92929,France,"A severe, austere wine that doesn't show its richness easily. The tannins are tight and firm and they dominate. Underneath is ripe fruit, the balance with tannins giving a foursquare, solid character.

92931,France,"Latour has always had the reputation of producing great wines in the less great vintages. The 2006 is a case in point. It brings structure and ripeness into a form that is almost ethereal. That elegance doesn't take away from the powerful fruit. The fruit in fact melds into the structure with ease. And, as a reminder this is a 2006, the density gives way to freshness on the finish.",,96,,Bordeaux,Pauillac,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Latour
92932,France,"As so often with Lafite, it is power that marks this wine. That, and density of texture. The additional element in this vintage, and at this stage of the wine's development, is a dominant wood element. The vanilla and tannins from the wood match well with the concentrated tannins of the fruit, which is dark, dense and tight. This is a wine for long-term aging: in 15 years this will have superb richness.",,96,,Bordeaux,Pauillac,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Lafite Rothschild
92933,US,"This wine is light on the palate, almost airy. The official alcohol reading is under 14%. Yet it packs the power of the world's greatest reds.

92935,US,"This is a showstopper, the top of the line at Chateau Rollat, certainly one of the most exciting new ventures to open in Walla Walla in the past decade. Deep and compact, it's a classic wine to cellar, holding its dark and smoky secrets tightly wound around a core of dense black fruits nuanced with streaks of bark, soil, earth and barrel.

92937,US,"This is one of those Napa Cabs that tastes glamorous. Even people who know little about wine will taste it and go, Wow. And the longer it sits in the glass and airs, the better it gets.

Fruit flavors favor cherry candy, with a leathery, tackroom undertone. The tannins are leathery and stick to the tongue, dampening the fruit.",Hellcat Red,84,25.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Airfield Estates
93208,Chile,"There's a lot of individuality to this wine, just not all good. The nose has cigar box and over-the-top sweet and baked aromas, yet the palate has a grating, acidic feel but also spice and raisiny flavors. All of it makes you more confused than confident; it has its good traits but seems out of whack.",Duette,84,20.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère,Indomita
93209,US,"Ripe tropical fruit and oak dominate this overly sweet Chardonnay. It's very rich in pineapple tart, golden mango, buttered toast and crème brûlée flavors, but lacks dry balance. Tastes like there's a lot of white sugar in there.",Vanumanutagi Vineyard,84,32.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Fernwood
93210,France,"Initially the wine is all firm tannins, but then there is a pure line of fresh black fruits that comes through, with cranberry tannins and blackberry jamminess. Above it all, is succulent richness and clear acidity. A beautifully shaped wine.",,95,,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Angélus
93211,France,"Cos d'Estournel has softened those austere Saint-Estèphe tannins and produced a wine that is all opulence and roundness. The tannins are certainly there, but they come through as big, bold richness. The power suggests it will age well, but for drinking earlier, the freshness of the sweet homemade plum jam promises well.",,95,200.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Cos d'Estournel
93212,Austria,"Kracher's Grande Cuvée is often the epitome of a vintage. This blend of Welschriesling and Chardonnay shows the structure of the year as well as its wonderful acidity. It is an exceptional wine, its botrytis so carefully fitted into the rich fruit. The lush, sweet orange flavor istamed by acidity, which provides a fitting lift to the finish.",Nouvelle Vague Grande Cuvée Nummer 7 Trockenbeerenauslese,95,111.0,Burgenland,,,White Blend,Kracher
93213,US,"Toasty, dense, dark and complex, this is suffused with a complex mix of coffee, earth, butterscotch, cherry and mineral, with an underlayer of game, roasted almond, herb and earth. Still a baby, young and tight, it opens out with decanting, turning silky and supple. The balance is impeccable, and herbal nuances are preserved, despite the 14.7% alcohol.",La Serenne,95,55.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Betz Family
93214,France,"While the aromas are tight and firm, once it is in the mouth, this wine just explodes. The tannins are dark, almost impenetrable, dry and dense. These tannins are a layer over the fruit that just piles up with ripe blackberry juice, an edge of blueberry. The soft sweetness of this range of flavors continues on the finish, pitted against the tannins.",,95,,Bordeaux,Saint-Julien,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Léoville Las Cases
93215,France,"Always ripe, always velvety and dense in texture, Pavie's 2006 nevertheless also shows more structure and elegance than in the past few vintages. The result is a great wine, with smoky, rich fruit and a dense, concentrated core of sweet tannins, chocolate and fresh raspberry flavors. While it is seductive now, it really needs many years of aging.",,95,,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pavie
93216,US,"Easily Shafer's greatest Merlot ever. Certainly its richest, with fabulously concentrated blackberry, cherry, licorice, chocolate and cinnamon spice flavors.

93217,France,"This is not a big Château Margaux, its style showing more elegance and discretion. The tannins are soft, although producing a dense web that lies underneath the black currant and plum fruit flavors. It is a wine that envelops the mouth, an edge of firmness over velvet fruit textures. The wine floats away slowly on the close.",,95,,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Margaux
93218,France,"Wonderful, evocative orange marmalade and ginger flavors play around this rich wine. Its botrytis dryness doesn't detract from the intense sweetness, ripe apricots, spice and deliciously refreshing acidity. The richness is in the texture, but the ripeness is in the open, generous fruit.",,95,,Bordeaux,Sauternes,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Rieussec

It is ripe, with layers of apricot and peach, lifted with spice and an over-arching sweet acidity that gives the wine a wonderful, heart-stopping lift.",,95,50.0,Bordeaux,Barsac,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Coutet
93220,France,"Although it begins with austerity, its acidity and tannins dominant,  the palate opens beyond its youthfulness after a few moments.

93221,Germany,"Some typical Prüm smelly notes are apparent on the nose, but there's also plenty of pineapple and pear scents, and the flavors really blossom on the palate; honeyed pineapple, melon and slate-like notes are sweet but balanced by tongue-tickling acids. Long on the finish, where it picks up additional mineral overtones. Should come into its own by 2016 and last 20–30 years thereafter.",Wehlener Sonnenuhr Auslese,94,47.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Joh. Jos. Prüm
93222,US,"This new release of Bésoleil is three quarters Grenache, the rest split evenly between Syrah and Mourvèdre. Scents of tree bark, black pepper and strawberry stand out, followed with traces of lavender, garrigue and enticing floral accents. Juicy and quite tannic, it's a fruit salad of flavors, pure, persistent and pleasurable. Finished in neutral oak, it's the fruit that dominates, especially the emphasis on Grenache.",Bésoleil Red Wine,94,44.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Betz Family
93223,US,"If Pinot's first responsibility is to seduce the palate, this one succeeds admirably. It's soft as velvet and silk, and drily opulent, with gorgeously refined tannins that frame lush, intricate flavors. Waves of cherry pie, red currant, licorice, cola and cedar flavors wash over the palate, and feel distinguished, the way a top red wine should. Drink now through 2012.",Primo's Hill,94,50.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kazmer & Blaise

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Syrah,Ojai
93225,US,"A terrific Cabernet from this mountain west of Sonoma Valley. Wonderfully ripe and complex in black currant, blackberry, mocha, cedar and spice flavors, its tannins are authoritative, and require some age to resolve. If you drink now, decant, but it should be best after 2010.",,94,52.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Peters Family
93226,US,"Loaded with honeysuckle, melon, pear, peach and hints of sweet grapefruit, this juicy wine perfectly captures the intensity of Washington Riesling and the complexity of German wines. Buoyant and precise, with notes of chalk and limestone in the finish, this is a stunning achievement in a challenging vintage.",,94,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Riesling,Poet's Leap
93227,US,"Like the tannic 2005, the winery's '06 needs time in the cellar. It's a bit hard and closed. But it's simply humongous in flavor, offering a deep well of blackberry and mulberry flavors and various wild berries with no names. You'll also detect dark chocolate, anise, Asian spices and beef jerky. Decant now, but best 2010 and beyond.",Coastlands Vineyard,94,69.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
93228,France,"The success of this wine owes as much to Merlot as to Cabernet. The Merlot has created the ripeness and smoothness of the wine. While the Cabernet keeps it firm and closed up, there is a base of rich, sweet fruit here that will show over the next two years. The style of the wine is moving away from elegance to power under the new regime of owners, Champagne Roederer.",,94,210.0,Bordeaux,Pauillac,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande
93229,France,"A firm, densely structured wine, with the sweetness turned as much into richness.

An impressive wine that needs time for aging.",,94,,Bordeaux,Sauternes,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château de Fargues
93230,France,"This is that rare Bordeaux Cabernet that comes close in style to a Napa Cabernet. The character comes from the mint aromas and medicinal edge, formed from new wood aging. At this stage in its development, the wine is powerful, but closed and tight. However, it is possible to taste the ripe perfumes and the black cherry juice flavors that come through the vanilla.",,94,,Bordeaux,Saint-Julien,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Ducru Beaucaillou
93231,US,"Shows the impeccably ripe fruitiness and purity that characterize Siduri Pinot Noirs, with the powerful structure of this celebrated vineyard. Dry and fairly tannic, the wine's flavors are of cherry pie filling, red currants, anise liqueur, chocolate and pepper spice.

93232,France,"The dominance of Cabernet Sauvignon in Figeac has really shone through in 2006. It has produced a dark, serious wine, mineral, austere and still very young. But there is weight there; the black berry fruits show over the tannin and the wood and dry core integrate well with this fruit. The finish is surprisingly fresh after all this structure. But the wine does need aging.",,94,,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Figeac
93233,US,"The Freestone Hill bottling is one of Dutton Goldfield's biggest and most powerful Pinot Noirs, and the '06 is nearly as stunning as the magnificent '05.

Terrific now, but the tannins will hold it for a decade.",Dutton Ranch Freestone Hill Vineyard,94,58.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
93234,US,"Shows classic Howell Mountain tight, hard tannins that lock down the flavors and make the wine astringent. But what flavors they are.

93235,US,"A very fine, ageable Pinot that shows a feral, exotic quality that is rare, but always welcome. Grown on the true, cool coastal strip of the appellation, it's dry and crisp in citrusy acids, with intricate flavors of wild cherries, balsam, maple syrup, teriyaki-grilled beef, licorice, cola and Asian spices. Such is the tannic structure that it should evolve over the next 8–10 years.",,94,75.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
93236,France,"A wine that succeeds in combining great depth of flavor and structure with an impressive array of flavors.

93238,France,"Yes, this wine is tannic. To begin with it seems austere and mineral. But then the substrate of black berry juice asserts itself. The fruits are fresh rather than sweet, combining with leather, spice and a presence of new wood. Typical of Montrose, it is hard to appreciate this young, with those tannins needing to open out. But wait 10 years.",,94,,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Montrose
93239,France,"A big, brooding wine, the fruit ripe and dense. Richness surrounds structure, giving a sumptuous layer to the dusty tannins.

93241,US,"Chardonnays from this vineyard are virtually guaranteed to be among the richest in California, and Talley's 2008 certainly doesn't disappoint. It's a massively structured, flamboyant wine, tremendous in tropical fruit, pear, peach and apple flavors that taste like they've been baked into a pie, along with the sweet, smoky crust. A tremendous wine that must be paired with equally sized food.

93242,Portugal,"One of Portugal's great wines, this epitomizes the minerality and the rich, dark fruit of the Douro.

93463,Chile,"A blast of chocolaty mint opens up this confected, somewhat conflicted Cabernet.

Here are nuanced, stacked flavors that subsume the berry and cassis fruit under herbs, earth and stone.

93544,US,"So dramatically deep in flavor, it immediately impresses for the depth of blackberries, cassis and minerals, enriched with sweet, smoky oak.

93551,US,"This is a rare premier release from the winery's new vineyard. It's a blend of different clones, and only 47 cases were produced. The wine is very exotic. It shows tiers of raspberries and cherries, but also more feral notes, of dried meats or leather, mushrooms, tart balsam, tangy minerals and scads of dusty, sweet Indian spices. Tannic and dry, it should unfold slowly over the next 10 years.",Block 10 Mass Selection Estate Vineyard,94,68.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem

93554,US,"One taste is all it takes to know this is a fine, dramatic and important Cabernet, but it's also an immature one. The tannins leap up and lock down the palate with dusty astringency. The cherry fruit is fresh and primary, almost jammy in its immediate sweetness. There are notes of blackberries and blueberries. All the parts are obviously there to maintain this wine for a good ten years in the cellar.",,93,65.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,JR Wine

93563,Spain,"This is a great wine, from a vintage that wasn't great. The nose is smooth and rich, with raspberry, plum, fine oak and all the spice that comes with it.

93571,Australia,"A top value in drink-now Shiraz, Reilly's 2008 Barking Mad shows none of the overripe character that plagued the vintage. It's almost floral on the nose, with an intense crème de framboise character.

93573,Australia,"At $50, this is the entry-level Shiraz from Clarendon Hills, and it's a worthy effort, offering blueberry fruit laced with vanilla, chocolate and coffee elements. It's round in the mouth and soft, making it immediately accessible.

Delicious now with decanting, and should hold and improve through 2012.",Cuvée Sandra,92,75.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Demetria
93642,US,"A beautiful evocation of Washington fruit, it has concentration, balance and structure, and the clean berry/cherry fruit is amplified by polished tannins, bright acids and light splashes of peppery spice. This is one of the finest pure Washington Merlots to be released in many years.",Stillwater Creek Vineyard,92,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Helix by Reininger
93643,France,"Great green apples and white fruits dominate this intense, mineral wine. There is some power, but the wine also floats easily over its structure, enhanced by the appetizing aftertaste. This is for food.",Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Brut,92,72.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Pehu-Simonet
93644,US,"100% Cabernet, this is very smooth and supple, a lovely wine, with darker, earthier flavors underneath the opening fruit. It shows the kind of elegance and grace one finds in Bordeaux, without intrusive barrel influences, and it's the kind of nose you want to bury your nose in. It wraps around you seductively, with an appealing shyness. The fruit and wood and earth flavors are seamless and interesting, as the wine leads you gently through a very long finish.",,92,30.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stephenson Cellars
93645,US,"Swanson has a great track record with this wine, which is always in need of time on release. The 2005 shows classic Napa structure, with hard but near-perfect tannins and lush, oak-sweetened black currant, cherry and dark chocolate flavors. Brilliant, but will benefit from a good three or four years in the cellar. Should evolve well beyond 2012.",Alexis,92,75.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Swanson
93646,US,"Where Rusack's regular '06 Syrah is a delicious wine to drink now, this reserve-style bottling is considerably more tannic, as well as deeper-flavored. It's very rich in dark chocolate, red currants, anise, orange zest and pepper-spice, a wine that impresses for its sheer power, but it really will benefit from aging. Try between 2009–2012.",Ballard Canyon Estate,92,36.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,Rusack

93648,US,"This is a young wine that needs cellaring to come around. Right now, it's tough in tannins, and the fruit is direct and primary. It really needs the alchemy of time for the wood, acids, tannins and flavors to come around. Give it three or four years for the black currants to marry with the cedar and become smoky-sweet.",SOMA Limited Private Reserve,92,86.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Marita's Vineyard
93649,US,"This new vintage of Novelty Hill's estate Chardonnay shows more acid and spice than the slightly richer, creamier 2005, but offers the same superb winemaking. The fruit is a perfect mix of apple, pear, passion fruit and green banana, laced with cinnamon and sweet baking spices. This is that all-too-rare, affordably-priced domestic Chardonnay. It does not require food to “fill in” what's missing—nothing is missing!",Stillwater Creek Vineyard,92,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Novelty Hill
93650,US,"Craig's Howell Mountain Cab typically is powerful and ripe, with bigtime tannins that require aging. The 2005 is such a wine. Made with a drop of Merlot, it shows black cherry and cassis fruit accented with lots of toasty new oak. But it's really young, stinging the palate with astringency. Should negotiate the next 10 years with ease.",,92,80.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Craig

This is a style for those who like rich but dry Champagne.",Grand Brut,92,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Perrier Jouët
93652,US,"This was one of the best Rieslings of the year last vintage, and the '07 is even better. It's absolutely dry and superbly racy. Acidity, at .82, is one of the highest I've seen in years. Balancing that is a broad, complex array of citrus, peach, apple, flower, petrol, mineral and spice flavors. If California Riesling is making a comeback, it's because of wines like this.",The Shell Mound,92,24.0,California,Marin County,North Coast,Riesling,Pey-Marin

93654,France,"This young vintage is outside the usual Grande Année range of vintages. Bollinger sees the unique heat of 2003 as a reason to make a special vintage for release early. The wine is rich, but being Bollinger, the richness has translated into the full character of the house style. It is relatively dry, packed with white fruits. Not for aging. Drink now.",2003 by Bollinger Brut,92,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Bollinger
93655,US,"Frazier breaks the triple-digit price barrier with this Cabernet. Like their regular '05, it's a very tannic wine, not suitable for drinking now or possibly anytime soon. But it's clearly powerful and concentrated in flavor, with a dense layering of cassis and freshly-crushed blackberries. Totally dry, but a little high in alcohol, it should reward cellaring over the next eight years.",Memento,92,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frazier
93656,US,"Perhaps because the winery's co-owner, Frank Ostini, is a restaurateur, he makes his wines in a forward, approachable style that doesn't require aging, although they're balanced enough for the cellar. The '06 Rio Vista is a fresh, silky wine whose smoky cherry and pepperspice flavors will soar with a grilled steak. Should hold nicely for six years.",Rio Vista Vineyard,92,42.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Hitching Post
93657,France,"If this seems soft at first, that's the year. Soon enough, the hallmark Gosset acidity and minerality show through, with the addition of spicy pear and some toast.

93658,US,"Ungainly now, with upfront, edgy tannins that interfere with the enjoyment of this wine, making it feel hard and astringent. However, there's a wealth of well-ripened cassis, bitter chocolate, cedar and anise flavors that are so powerful, the wine should easily ride out midterm aging. Give this Bordeaux blend a good 4 years in the cellar, and it should hold its own for years beyond that.",,92,75.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vine Cliff
93659,US,"Here's a really good Merlot from a producer that does a great job at it and has kept prices fair for years.

93727,US,"This is a very rich, elaborate Chardonnay, detailed with pineapple, pear, and apricot flavors, and a coating of sweetly smoked, vanilla-tinged oak. The acidity is brisk and fine. It's complex and impressive, yet its high alcohol and some overripeness suggest that it's not ageable—drink up.",Durell Vineyard,90,48.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Saxon Brown
93728,US,"Fumé Blanc is just another name for Sauvignon Blanc, and this is a delicious one. Dry and racy in acidity, it has deep citrus, tropical fruit and gooseberry flavors. At this price, it's one of the best Sauvignon Blancs on the market. Relatively easy to find, with more than 30,000 cases produced.",,90,19.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Fumé Blanc,Robert Mondavi

93730,France,"Shows some oak aging in its aromas of cedar, caramel and baking spices, but also in the velvety mouthfeel and slightly drying finish. Thankfully, there are just enough ripe cherries to carry the freight, so while purists may be dismayed, plenty more will enjoy the wine's mix of fruit and oak.

93732,Spain,"After a leafy, somewhat burnt opening that seems muddled, things fall into place.

93733,US,"The winery has been on a roll the last few years with Zinfandels that not only are delicious, but show real class. With this bottling. V. Sattui captures the essence of ripe, heady Russian River Zinfandel. Yes, the alcohol is high, but that's Zinfandel for you, and without it you wouldn't have that ripe, spicy berry-pie flavor that's as soft as candy.

93737,US,"Lange's reserve has a resonant, spicy depth that elevates it above the well-made regular bottling.

A hint of coconut marks the finish.",Reserve,90,32.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Lange
93738,US,"This never went through malolactic fermentation, resulting in a beautiful, food-friendly offering. First noticed is the brisk acidity that's like a squeeze of sweet Meyer lemon, brightening the tropical fruit and pear flavors. Then the wine's intensity and complexity sink in, leading to a long, spicy finish. Pair this with Asian fare.",Bedrock,90,24.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Riverbench

93743,France,"Ripe and rich, this is a concentrated, spicy and perfumed Syrah. It is packed with sweet tannins and juicy blackberry fruit, with a cut of acidity. Its richness makes it already mature, although it could age for another few years.",Cyrano,90,,Provence,Vin de Pays Var,,Syrah,Château Routas

93745,US,"This Syrah is considerably lighter in body than you'd expect for a variety that's often heavy and full bodied.

93748,France,"This has a somewhat high-toned and mineral-driven nose, offering notes of roasted squab and pheasant, sage and mocha ice cream. Spirituous alcohol and opulent fruit are the focus of the highly extracted palate. The acidity is present but relegated to the background, while the rather supple, mouth-coating tannins provide most of the wine's structure. The new oak is subtle.

93749,US,"While this is not the best Dominus vintage, it does show elegantly smooth tannins, dryness and earthiness that accompanies the black­berry and cassis fruit.

The price is fair.",Sustainable White,84,11.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Red Blend,Parducci
93758,Argentina,"A tough sell at this price. The nose is minty, green and smells of tobacco, spice and fern fronds, while the palate is tangy, clangy in feel and dry.

93760,US,"There's not a whole lot going on in this Chard, with muted aromas of overripe peach and hints of mealy pear in the mouth. A touch flabby but the finish is clean and the balance solid. The label peels off like a sticker for easy record keeping.",Social Club White,83,13.0,New York,Long Island,Long Island,Chardonnay,Brooklyn Oenology

93773,Chile,"Sweet, minty and confected, with marshmallow and candied berry aromas.

It will probably always be firm, but the black currant fruit flavors will come through eventually—maybe in 5–7 years.",,93,,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château la Gaffelière
93817,France,"A big, ripe chocolate-flavored wine with spice, new wood and a smooth, polished character.

The finish is long, the flavors echoing the perfumes on the nose.",,93,,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Rauzan-Ségla
93818,Italy,"Mount Etna's Don Peppino vineyard is responsible for some of the volcano's most precious and highest quality fruit. This wine opens with a light hue and delicate aromas of violets, white almonds, cranberries and fresh plums. The nose is polished and refined. It's hard to believe that sucha violent volcano can produce such a feminine wine.",Prephylloxera La Vigna di Don Peppino,93,96.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Etna,,Red Blend,Tenuta delle Terre Nere
93819,US,"This is one of the winery's more elegant, sensual wines. What it does not possess in sheer power it more than makes up for in hedonistic delight. Racy and silky, it excites the palate with intricate layers of black raspberry and cherry tart, cola, Asian spices and smoky oak. The finish goes on and on and on.",Peay Vineyard,93,54.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
93820,France,"The second wine of Château Ausone is an impressive younger brother. It has the same density and suavity, but the fruits are fresher, lighter. Those fruits go right through the firm tannins, leaving spice and delicious, juicy flavors. It is a complete wine, showing all the exuberant freshness of 2006.",,92,,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Chapelle d'Ausone

93822,France,"A ripely smooth, polished wine, the new wood a major constituent of its character. It has a severe structure, dark and concentrated, but the texture of the very ripe fruit is rounded, jammy, giving a more generous potential. Age for at least five years.",,92,,Bordeaux,Pessac-Léognan,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pape Clément
93823,France,"A lovely, fresh, juicy wine that has a delightful lilt to its fruit. Red and black berries intermingle easily with a core of firm tannins.

This is a finely structured wine, already well developed.",,92,,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pavie Macquin
93824,US,"Silky and luscious, this extraordinary Sémillon from the makers of the Chateau Rollat red wines sends up cascading scents of orange blossom, orange peel, citrus and light tropical, moving into the mouth with beautifully integrated fruits dappled with honey and tea.

93825,Germany,"Hugely ripe, with 14.5% alcohol and a touch of residual sweetness, but also a richly textured mouthfeel and layers of honey, apricot preserves, slate-driven minerality and spice. It may be a bit precariously balanced, so opt for drinking it over the near term.",Rüedesheim Berg Rottland Erstes Gewächs,92,44.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Johannishof
93826,France,"A beautifully dense wine, concentrated and ripe. With its opulent style, packed with sweetness, this is dominated by its smooth, velvet texture, the botrytis packed behind. An impressive wine that is good to drink now, but should age well.",,92,,Bordeaux,Sauternes,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château de Malle

93836,US,"Less immediately accessible than the 2005, the 2006 is tight and tart and almost seems encased in some sort of a shell. The fruit is concentrated raspberry and plum, and the acids taste natural while the tannins are polished and proportionate. The wine stays focused and strong through a very long finish that dapples in toasted coconut and chocolate malt. If you are a Rollat collector (and you should be) this would be the wine to cellar for five or six years, waiting for the Edouard to come into full flower.",Rollat,92,45.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau Rollat
93837,France,"Taking advantage of the delicious fruit of 2006, this Branaire-Ducru shows a charming side. It brings out ripe, spicy black plums and black cherry spice to go with the lively, fresh tannins. That's not to say that there isn't structure, but today it is the fruit that dominates.",,92,,Bordeaux,Saint-Julien,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Branaire-Ducru

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Alma Rosa
93840,France,"A wine that appears almost too delicious at this stage. Through the black fruit and sweet tannins, the texture is immediately attractive. However, there is a dense structure behind this open exterior that should see it age well.",,93,,Bordeaux,Saint-Julien,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Branaire-Ducru
93841,New Zealand,"This vineyard is coming into its own, with stellar wines emerging from Felton Road and Pyramid Valley in 2007 as well as this offering.

93845,US,"Quite as good as the excellent '07, maybe even better, as it shows a little more structure behind the raspberry and cherry flavors.

What a shame how little Pinot is actually grown in the Santa Cruz Mountains.",,93,39.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Black Ridge
93846,US,"A five-grape Bordeaux blend dominated by Merlot and Cab Franc, this is a deft mix of grapes nicely melded into a complete and satisfying wine.

93861,Spain,"A little more raisiny than expected, but that's offset by a brilliant floral streak and more dominant blackberry, blueberry and black plum flavors.

93901,US,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated Bordeaux blend is the winery's top red, and in the warm vintage of 2004, they've produced a balanced, rich wine that needs time. It shows classic flavors of currants, chocolate, sweet tobacco, herbs and cedar, but the tannins are fresh and arch. Should develop gracefully over the next 10–12 years.",Cyrus,92,55.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Alexander Valley Vineyards
93902,US,"A very nice wine, lush and drinkable, that demonstrates not only the pedigree of its vineyards (Stolpman and Thompson), but also the deft approach of the winemaker. Soft and juicy, it offers layers of crushed cherry, cassis, red currant, licorice, beef jerky and black pepper flavors, wrapped into rich, fine tannins. Drink now through 2010.",,92,34.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Grenache,Jaffurs
93903,France,"A rich, creamy, toast- and caramel- flavored wine. There are impressive layers of complexity here from the apples and cream taste to the ripe acidity. Swathes of perfumed grapefruit and green fruits waft over this rich wine.",Terres de Noël Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Brut,92,,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Jean Milan
93904,US,"Shows the richness and fullness of body that this cool region of Santa Barbara is known for in Pinot Noir. The wine exhibits the twin elements of complexity and ageability. Somewhat tannic now, it's flamboyantly flavored, with a mélange of cherries, black raspberries, red currants, cola, licorice, Asian spices and smoky oak, and is very dry. Best now and through 2012.",Calmant Creek Vineyard,92,49.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,La Fenêtre
93905,US,"Lush and immediately attractive, this Pinot seduces the palate with ripe berry, cola, herb tea, vanilla and spice flavors and lots of toasty oak. It's a silky wine, with a fancy structure that calls for fine food. But it's also young, with a precocious feeling. Try holding until 2010, and it should develop through 2015.",Thirtieth Anniversary Vintage Selleck Vineyard,92,75.0,California,Mt. Harlan,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Calera
93906,US,"A very good Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux blend from Agustin Huneeus. While it would not be true to say it's a second wine of Quintessa, it does show the balance and integrity of that bottling, with a firm structure and dramatically layered black currant, mineral and cedar flavors. Will undoubtedly age. Best now through 2011, at least.",,92,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Faust
93907,US,"Less jammy and forward than the '04 Elevage, but more closed and tannic than the winery's regular 2005 Cabernet, this Bordeaux blend really needs time to show its stuff. It has obviously deep and impressive currant and blackberry flavors, but the tannins are significant. Hold until at least 2010.",Elevage,92,78.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Chimney Rock
93908,France,"A full, ripe creamy wine with a fine balance between fresh red berries and pink grapefruit crispness.

This is already delicious, but could certainly age over several years.",Vintage Rosé Brut,92,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin
93909,France,"Taittinger's delicate, elegant style shows well in this beautifully balanced rosé. It moves towards very dry, giving flavors that are of pink grapefruit, along with toast and hazelnuts. The integration for such a relatively young wine is already there, and this is not a wine for aging—a reflection of the heat of the 2003 vintage. But for now, this is what a great rosé should be.",Comtes de Champagne Brut Rosé,92,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Taittinger
93910,US,"Winemaker Tim Stevens' dark, subtle, beautifully proportioned wines glide across the palate like Apollo Ono dancing with the stars. The cool site brings out some of the floral and citrus accents often missing from Merlot, and the darker cherry and plum fruit flavors fill in right behind.

93911,US,"This is every bit the equal of, if not even a bit better than, the outstanding 2005 Novelty Hill Sauvignon Blanc.

93912,US,"The vineyard is up in the Mayacamas between Spring Mountain and Sonoma Valley, and the wine shows quite a bit of power. Coming from this hot vintage, it's also very ripe and fruity, in a California way. But it's classically structured and dry, and the tannins are softly complex.

93915,US,"A lovely Otis, now rounding out and showing pretty dried herb character throughout. There is a pleasing sweetness to the core of cherry/plum fruit, elevated with baking spices and lingering softly into the finish.

93916,US,"The wine is still showing a lot of rich new oak flavors: toast, coconut and vanilla crème. Sur lie aging (in 100% French oak) adds plenty of texture and the impression of minerality.

93919,US,"Rich and savory, this fine Pinot Noir is quite dry and brims with cool-climate acidity. It's a bit backward now, with ripe cherry, blueberry and sandalwood flavors wrapped in firm tannins.

93920,US,"A lovely, fresh wine, relatively pale in color with orange-ruby notes, and far lighter in body than most other Central Coast Grenaches. There's a Pinot Noir-esque quality to the silky delicacy. Flavorwise, it's all about cherry, cola, raspberry, Mandarin orange tea, smoky vanilla, Asian spices and white pepper. A savory, distinctive red wine with just a touch of oak.",,91,38.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Grenache,Margerum

Combined with the benefits of a stellar vintage, this is substantial, textural and  complex. The toasty new oak flavors are more than matched by rich layers of berries, cassis and black cherries.

94125,France,"Finely structured, this has become an impressive wine, gaining in intensity as it develops. The tannins are powerful but come from concentrated fruit as much as from wood.

94133,US,"Make no mistake—the model for this wine can be found among the classified growth white wines of Bordeaux.

94149,US,"Relentless, a blend this year of mainly Syrah and Petite Sirah, is always a very good wine. The '07 strikes one as, above all, tannic and dry. Then the blackberry, black cherry, dark baker's chocolate, herb tea and smoked meat flavors kick in, impressing with their complexity. It's a distinctive wine, quite unlike anything else in California. Despite the hard tannins it's drinkable now, and will challenge chefs and sommeliers to figure out what to serve it with.

It's the opposite of today's soft, sweet fruit bombs, being bone dry and somewhat austere, showing a tightly knit tannic structure.

94624,US,The label of this wine states ‘Dry Vignoles' yet this wine is anything but. The nose is fresh and light with pretty gardenia scents but the palate is cloying and fades quickly to leave a slightly chemical aftertaste.,Dry,81,16.0,Missouri,Missouri,,Vignoles,Montelle
94625,US,"An eclectic blend of 55% Ruby Cabernet and 45% Tempranillo turns out an off-beat wine, with smoke and char notes dominating the nose and a tinge of perfumed hand soap hanging behind the raspberry fruit in the mouth.

94637,Uruguay,"While this ranks as one of the best Uruguayan reds we've come across, it's not a slam dunk. First off, there's the price; $60 is a lot to spend for any wine, let alone one from the frontier. But getting past that there's pretty fruit, purity, texture and balance to this prestige-aimed effort. And it finishes with alluring tobacco and earth notes. The blend is Cab Franc with Merlot, Tannat and Cab Sauvignon.",El Preciado Premier Gran Reserva,89,60.0,San Jose,,,Red Blend,Castillo Viejo

94639,Uruguay,"Earth, saddle leather and roasted berry aromas lead the meaty nose to a round, mildly tanninc palate that's holding full plum and berry flavors.

94640,Uruguay,"Among the Uruguayan wines we've tried more than once, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Tannat and Merlot has integrity.

Feelwise, it's tight and tough, but with food it will show fairly well.",Rio Colorado,86,35.0,El Colorado,,,Red Blend,DeLucca
94641,Uruguay,"Maybe this wine weighs in a bit stewy and heavy, but along the way it has some virtues, namely an attractive rum-raisin quality to the bouquet and intense black-fruit flavors. It's a chunky wine that stumbles along the palate, but you have to admire it's richness and stuffing. The blend is Tannat, Cabernet and Merlot.",TCM,85,19.0,Canelones,,,Red Blend,Toscanini
94642,Uruguay,"This blend of several grapes led by Tannat is a touch gritty and stewed. Yes, it has its qualities such as jammy berry and a nice, fleshy feel.

94646,Uruguay,"Very expensive for a novelty, and without coming down too hard on it, it's fat and raisiny with a heavy ripeness that is tough to swallow.

94647,France,"A big, rich wine, showing its gorgeous fruit easily. But with a core of dryness, the ripest apricots touched by caramel, it should age well over many years.

94681,France,"Appropriately big and burly, full of ripe fruit, rather soft as well as rich.

94791,US,"Here's a ripe, exuberantly fruity Cabernet that tastes like a pastry dessert melted into wine. But it's dry. Delicious for its buttery, baked pie crust flavors of black cherries and cola. Seems best now and for a few years.",,87,42.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jax

94793,Austria,"A surprisingly mature-colored wine, with flavors that are of herbs, dark tannins as well as more juicy beets and dark black cherries. There is firm concentration, but the wine should be drunk now.",Selection,87,18.0,Burgenland,,,Zweigelt,Juris
94794,US,"With pineapple crème brûlée, Key lime pie and kiwi flavors that are accented with sweet, smoky oak, this Chardonnay offers an uptown sip compromised only by a certain herbaceousness.

Should develop over the next six years.",Estate Grown,87,35.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sausal
94800,US,"Amazingly rich and ripe, defining the Bien Nacido cool-climate style. The grapes hung for a long time in this excellent vintage, getting ripe and balanced, and the wine offers dazzling opulence, while preserving vital acidity. Showcases dessert pastry flavors of pineapples, mangoes, buttered toast, buttercream, meringue and honeysuckle, accented with dusty spices. Simply beautiful from first sniff to the last swallow.",Santa Barbara Historic Vineyards Collection Bien Nacido Vineyard,95,30.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Au Bon Climat
94801,US,"Made from 100% Sauvignon Blanc, with a great many vines more than 50 years old, this is an enormously complex wine. Fruit doesn't dominate. Flowers and minerals do, with flavors of stones, herbs and earth. What fruit there is brings to mind tart limes and lemons, perhaps white apricots and peaches, with peppery Asian spice accents. Has the weight of a great red wine, and is bone dry. Don't drink it too cold. Will age for a long time, perhaps a decade, in a cool cellar.",To Kalon Vineyard I Block,95,75.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Fumé Blanc,Robert Mondavi
94802,US,"A tremendous Cabernet, pure and refined, and undoubtedly the beneficiary of its great vintage. It's dry and elegant, with the slightly herbal tinge and soft tannins that Alexander Valley invariably lends. Yet the flavor profile is dominated by delicious, oak-inspired blackberries, cherries and currants. Brilliant and beautiful, and should develop for many years.",Vyborny Vineyard,95,70.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt
94803,US,"There's a beautiful wine in here, but it's buried under tannins. Also, the fruit is all primary blackberry, blueberry, raspberry and cherry jam, while the oak stands to the side, insistent in vanilla and toast. Nothing has merged, everything is separated. Yet this is a great wine, easily the greatest Cabernet to emerge from Livermore Valley in memory. Beautiful now, and should develop for a decade.",Ghielmetti Vineyard Clone 4,95,100.0,California,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Steven Kent
94804,US,"Expensive, but brilliant. At the forefront of California Sauvignon Blanc. Shows bright and clean acidity framing intense tangerine, lime and honey flavors, as well as complications from oak. Yet it finishes bone dry and elegant. Delicious and compelling, this wine lifts Sauvignon Blanc into entirely new territory.",Musque,95,40.0,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Chalk Hill
94805,US,"A beautiful, classy Cab, marked by smoky new oak and very ripe blackberry and cassis flavors, with a streak of minerals. The vineyard is in the Vaca Mountains, in the valley's far east. You can taste the sunshine in the wonderful fruitiness, and the tannins are extraordinarily refined, but they're also aggressive.

94806,US,"A best-of-barrels selection from the winery's various vineyards, this is a lush, intricate Chardonnay made in the modern style. It's fantastically rich in pineapple tart flavors, with the sweet, smoky crust, and more acidic citrus notes of Meyer lemons and limes.

Now–2014.",Diana's,95,55.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Testarossa

94808,US,"Too young for drinking now, or anytime soon for that matter. It's all primary blackberry and currant fruit, new oak and tannins. But there's a dramatic quality to the structure, a purity of parts that suggests the cellar. There are waves of licorice, mocha and buttered cinnamon toast, with everything vying for supremacy. Let all the elements battle it out for a good six years. This wine should age gracefully through 2015, at least.",Estate Moose Valley Vineyard,94,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,D.R. Stephens
94809,Australia,"Lovely dessert-style Riesling at an extremely attractive price. It yields dried apricot aromas, then turns to honeyed marmalade in the mouth, just loaded with orange-apricot preserves. It's weighty and viscous, with a long, sweet finish. Should last through at least 2016.",The Noble Wrinkled,94,19.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Riesling,D'Arenberg
94810,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay for drinking now. It's dry and crisp, with pineapple, peach and pear flavors accented with vanilla oak and creaminess from lees aging. Despite the richness, there's a firm minerality, a tang of steel that makes the wine bracing. The grapes are from a vineyard in the southerly, cool Coombsville area, an area that needs its own appellation.",,94,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Hunnicutt
94811,US,"A beautiful, ultrafine Cabernet that shows rich blackberry, black currant, violet, cocoa and cedar flavors, and while it has tightly wound mountain tannins, it's entirely approachable now.

From the Davies family, of Schramsberg.",,94,40.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,JD
94812,US,"This is a wonderfully rich, seductive Pinot Noir. It has the lushness and complexity you want in a fine California bottling, with a silky texture and crisp acidity.

Lots of new oak, but it's perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume.",Tina Marie Vineyard,94,48.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fulcrum
94813,US,"A superb bubbly, almost entirely comprised of Chardonnay, with 2% Pinot Blanc. It's super-sophisticated, with that elegantly dry, crisp, yeasty feeling associated only with the best sparkling wines. Shows its California origins in the ripe lemon, lime and strawberry flavors that flatter, then pull back into a closure of minerals and spice. A great wine, although the mousse could be finer.",Le Rêve Blanc de Blancs,94,85.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Domaine Carneros
94814,US,"A gorgeous wine, dry and complex, whose natural fruit richness and acidity have been accented by full-bore Burgundian treatment of sur lies and oak barrel aging.

94815,US,"Talk about sensuous! This one's sheer silk and satin, a voluptuous wine that seduces the senses. Beyond the fabulous texture is a complex structure and tiers of flavors, such as fresh wild cherries and raspberries, bacon, black pepper and lots of sweet, smoky new oak.

94816,US,"Shows all the richness you could want in a Chardonnay, with smoky, buttery flavors of pineapples, lemons and pears, wrapped into a smooth, creamy mouthfeel.

Good now, after a brief decant.",Oakville Terraces,94,70.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,De Sante
94818,US,"This vintage has the Horiuchi artist label. Another glorious wine from the 2007 vintage, full and forward, packed with plum and purple fruits.

The finish—thick and textural and darkly chocolaty—wraps around polished, elegant tannins.",,94,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,àMaurice
94819,US,"Quite a good, distinguished Cabernet. It's rich and robust, with explosive blackberry and currant flavors, liberally coated with smoky oak, that finish in a swirl of chocolate.

94820,US,"Very dry and tannic, as Petite Sirah should be. But unlike many “Pets,” it's also balanced and elegant. The official alcohol is only 13.5%, yet there's not a trace of greenness. In fact, the wine, which has plenty of French oak, is quite rich in blackberry and black currant flavors. Really a superb example, a Petite Sirah for Cabernet fans. Should evolve interestingly for many years.",Esoterica Chavez-Leeds Vineyard,94,40.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Petite Sirah,Kent Rasmussen
94821,US,"A beautiful wine that will redefine the way you view Lake County.

94822,US,"This wine's dense complexity is immediately apparent in the nose; offering hints of Asian spice, cinnamon, cardamom, along with supple layers of purple and black fruits.

94825,US,"A very finely crafted Pinot Noir, although it's also very young and wants some time in the cellar.

94826,US,"Mostly Cabernet, with a small percentage of the other Bordeaux varieties, this is a very rich, dramatically layered wine. It's notable for both its intensely smooth tannins and the lush fruit, which suggests waves of raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, rose petals and oak, courtesy of 100% new French barrels. Yet there's an underlying minerality that gives firmness and grounding.

94828,US,"This is a very rich, ripe, flamboyant Pinot, made in the lush California style.

94829,US,"Extremely rich and ripe, with tremendous pineapple, pear, mango and white flower flavors that have been liberally oaked.

94836,US,"This tastes tight, tannic and acidic, lacking richness despite its core of black cherry fruit. It is a letdown after the winery's wonderful 2007 bottling.

94994,US,"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon perfectly captures the vineyard's strengths: lush, ripe, fleshy fruit that shows perfectly ripened flavors of cherry and cassis, bolstered by ripe, chewy tannins.

94995,US,"This new, limited release red blend is what winery owners Myles Anderson and Gordy Venneri called their version of a super Tuscan. It's half old-vine Cabernet Sauvignon from the Sagemoor vineyard, and half Sangiovese. Somehow the two grapes soften each other, keeping the old vine detail and dried herbal character of the Cab, and mixing in plush and spicy red fruit with hints of mushroom and olive.

95000,US,"DeLille's D2 red (51% Merlot/38% Cabernet Sauvignon/8% Cab Franc/3% Petit Verdot) is a declassified wine in the best possible sense—the grapes come from all of the winery's premier vineyard sources. The result is a substantial, even meaty red wine, muscular rather than plump. The fruit is layered and tart, its flavors laced with smoke, tar and licorice.

95004,US,"This is 100% Malbec, so inky it is black in color. The flavors echo the color, with amazing density. Black fruits, black olives, smoke and spice are structured around thick tannins.

This unique vineyard phenomenon only occurs in a handful of Italian vineyards and Fattoria Zerbina is lucky enough to have one.

95011,Austria,"A single-vineyard wine from a top site in Gols. It is darkly solid, a powerful wine that exudes dark figs, firm tannins and big, rich fruit.

Age for 2–3 years.",Gabarinza,91,50.0,Burgenland,,,Austrian Red Blend,Gsellmann & Hans
95012,US,"This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from DeLille's estate-owned vineyard. Pure, focused and expressive, it is both tightly defined and bursting with bright, spicy red and black fruit. What is given away in terms of breadth (from a lack of blending grapes) is gained in terms of depth; this really shows the varietal character (in Washington) as well as the character (rock, streaks of iron) of the Red Mountain AVA.

95022,France,"Rounded, relatively soft wine, but one that shows balance. Sweet fruit plays with black currant acidity, giving density, even if the tannins are lightweight.

95202,Portugal,"Big, bold and tannic, this has a solid structure that's balanced by ripe fruit. It is full bodied, rich in damson and plum flavors, with a firm, dusty texture. Drink now, but this can also age over the next 1–2 years.",Santos Jorge,88,7.0,Alentejo,,,Portuguese Red,Herdade dos Machados
95203,Italy,"Dark in color and slightly bashful at first, this blend of Syrah, Sangiovese and Merlot shows strength in its solid structure, with bright aromas of red cherry, blackberry, leather and cured meat. It would pair perfectly with stewed game meat, like wild boar.",Nemorino,88,27.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,I Giusti e Zanza
95204,Spain,"This is always a really good buy among rosé sparklers and a personal favorite in the Best Buy category. It opens with red fruit, vanilla and yeasty aromas, but it's racy, crisp and refined in the mouth, with nectarine, peach and controlled citrus flavors. It's dry, spicy and fairly smooth on the finish.",Cordon Rosado,88,12.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
95205,US,"As rich, ripe and flashy as any Pinot Noir out there. It floods the mouth with jammy raspberries and cherries, with smoky oak sweetness like pie crust, sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar. Drink soon.",Boonville,88,50.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Jim Ball
95206,US,"This is a good vintage for Handley's Mendocino blend, a mishmash from various vineyards throughout the county. The wine has structure and bright acidity, with its intensity tucked between its layers. This can likely age.",,88,25.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Handley
95207,Italy,"Having spent 26 months in oak, this dark and sophisticated Sagrantino opens with savory aromas of toast, cured meat, dark chocolate and dried fruit. It shows a thick, velvety texture, with a touch of tannic firmness on the finish.",,88,34.0,Central Italy,Sagrantino di Montefalco,,Sagrantino,Benincasa
95208,Italy,"Dal Tralcetto shows the softness of Montepulciano, with aromas of sweet cherry, prune, tobacco, cinnamon and toasted nut.

95209,France,"Despite some tough tannins on the finish, this is an intriguingly complex wine that may prove even better than this rating suggests. It starts with a garrigue note and a hint of tapenade, then adds bright cherry fruit and plenty of dusty tannins. Drink 2014–2020.",,88,45.0,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,,Rhône-style Red Blend,André Brunel
95210,Italy,"A blend of 75% Sangiovese, with additions of Merlot and Sagrantino, this opens with spicy aromas of cinnamon and crushed clove, with background tones of blackberry, cherry cola and black licorice. Pair this with veal and wild mushrooms.",,88,38.0,Central Italy,Montefalco Rosso,,Red Blend,Lungarotti
95211,US,"This is a brisk, minerally, quite fresh white wine. The cool vintage and low alcohol sets the flavors in the cucumber and apple corridor. Acids are firm but not sour; it's a fine white wine for summer sipping.",,88,17.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris,Lange
95212,Italy,"A wonderful expression of Pecorino, this opens with a beautiful floral intensity and fresh aromas of honey, peach, apricot and yellow rose.

95213,Italy,"This Sagrantino by the relatively new brand Tenuta Castelbuono (owned by the same family that runs Ferrari sparkling wine) opens with savory notes of cured meat, blackberry and tobacco. It feels rich and spicy on the finish.",,88,,Central Italy,Montefalco Sagrantino,,Sagrantino,Tenuta Castelbuono
95214,US,"A full and creamy style of Sauvignon Blanc, this has a lot of dense almond and vanilla notes set against high tones of bright peach and flint. With its great, fresh acidity, it will hold up against an appetizer like goat cheese on crackers.",,88,23.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Sauvignon Blanc,Saracina
95215,Spain,"Notes of baked-berry, herb and savory spice come together well on the bouquet. It feels chunky and round but lively, with plum and cassis flavors that carry an herbal, tomatoey shading. This is fresh and herbal enough so that you know it's Old World.",Gran Coronas Reserva,88,24.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Torres
95216,US,"This Cabernet has a wonderfully smooth texture. It's tasty and rich in blackberry fruit, with a touch of sweet, savory raisin and lots of exotic spice. Easy to drink this dry wine over the next few years.",T.R. Passalacqua Vineyard,88,35.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Owl Ridge
95217,US,"There's a touch of honeyed sweetness to this wine that gives it a softly appealing taste. The orange, apricot, tropical fruit and vanilla flavors are absolutely delicious, while there's just enough acidity to lift and balance the richness.",,88,30.0,California,Bennett Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Matanzas Creek
95218,France,"Starts with raspberry and cherry aromas and a dusty, earthy note that adds complexity and character. You can sense the warmth of the vintage in the glass, with slightly raisined notes that come through on the palate alongside the supple tannins. Drink it over the next few years.",L'Andéol Rasteau,88,25.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône Villages,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Perrin & Fils
95219,Portugal,"This is very ripe, rounded and rich, with its black fruit dominating the tarry, tannic character. Chocolate and mint notes surface from the wood aging. With its dark toast element, this could age another two years.",Private Selection,88,,Alentejano,,,Portuguese Red,Monte Seis Reis
95220,US,"This is Ferrari-Carano's most upscale wine, a blend comprised of all five of the famous Bordeaux varieties. It's as lush and intricate as almost anything out of Napa, with sumptuous blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors. The giveaway that it's Sonoma comes in the herbaceousness and slightly greener tannins. Now–2013.",Tresor,94,58.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ferrari-Carano
95221,US,"The tannins are strong in this 100% Cab, giving it a tough astringency, but there's no denying the wealth of blackberries, black currants, violets and cedar that flood the mouth and last through a long, spicy finish. The vineyard is in the cooler southern part of the valley, on the east side of Oak Knoll. Give this wine time. 2012–2018.",Out of Sight Vineyard,94,85.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Flora Springs
95222,US,"A brilliant dessert wine. It costs a lot of money to pick a wine like this, which is carefully selected on an almost cluster-by-cluster basis, but the results speak for themselves. Very sweet and pure, with honey, apricot jam, pineapple crème brûlée and vanilla custard flavors. Utterly delicious.",Gold Select Late Harvest Blanc,94,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,Martin Estate
95223,France,"A beautifully ripe wine, layering all the dense botrytis of the vintage with freshest acidity. It has weight, the texture of grainy honey, ripe yellow fruits, mango and orange zest. Impressive and certainly for aging.",,94,110.0,Bordeaux,Sauternes,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Sigalas Rabaud
95224,US,"Despite a burst of tannins and acidity that make this wine somewhat aggressive, it's absolutely delicious, and should reward 3–5 years in the cellar. The flavors are massive, suggesting rich black cherry pie filling, cola and cedar, with a tantalizing edge of chocolate and roasted almonds. It's quite a good wine. Decant if you drink now.",West Slope Estate Grown,93,70.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Donum
95225,US,"This is one of the most tannic Cabs Far Niente has produced in quite a while. It's really not drinkable now, despite very complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, licorice, tobacco and plums, along with plenty of smoky new oak. Made with a few drops of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, which add perfume and flowers, it's a wine that won't come into its own for quite a while. Hold until 2013, at least, and it should provide interesting drinking for years after, in a proper cellar.",Estate Bottled,93,115.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Far Niente
95226,Spain,"A touch doughy on the nose, with prune and blackberry aromas that are neither pushy nor aggressive. The palate is ripe, rich and just forward enough, with blackberry, wild berry, coffee and fudge flavors. Settles nicely on the finish, and overall this wine shows almost all of what's good about modern Ribera del Duero wines. 250 cases made; drink now through 2015.",Tinto Figuero Noble,93,131.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,García Figuero
95227,US,"Quite a fine wine, although like Flora Springs' other '07 Cabs, it needs time in the cellar to come around. Grown in the Pope Valley section of eastern Napa, it shows ripe, flashy flavors of blackberries, cherries and chocolate, but those tannins are tough and hard. You can decant it now, but better to hold until 2011 or so.",Wild Boar Vineyard,93,85.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Flora Springs
95228,US,"Disconnected in its youth, with separate oak and fruit elements that need time to find each other and marry. The oak shows up as caramel and butterscotch, while the fruit stands aloof, in blackberry and black currant superiority. Seems to have the inherent balance for aging. Try after 2013.",Cyrus Ryan Vineyard,93,95.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Barnett
95229,US,"Done in a spätlese style, this off-dry wine is elegance personified. Complex flavors weave through the palate—sweet hay, honey, citrus and stone fruits, breakfast tea, chamomile, jasmine. It just keeps on going, while retaining a lightness and transparency that rivets your attention.",,93,24.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Riesling,Trisaetum
95230,France,"The aromas are intensely sweet, full of orange marmalade and honey. The palate goes more for spice, with oranges and brown sugar allied to fresh fruits, apricots and lychees. The final flavors are delicious and enticing.",,93,,Bordeaux,Barsac,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Coutet
95231,US,"This has pure fruit – strawberry especially – creating an elegant, light, delicate, complex, though still quite young wine. Some caraway seed flavors come into play, and bolder black cherry fruit.",Maresh Vineyard,93,50.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Kelley Fox
95232,US,"From the steep Sonoma slopes of Mount St. Helena comes this tannic, concentrated young 100% Cabernet. Dramatic in structure and flavor, with massively packed blackberries, dark chocolate and pain grillé. The wine was aged in 49% new oak, which adds smoky, spice overtones. Drink now and through 2013.",Jackson Hills,93,40.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kendall-Jackson
95233,US,"This is a Zin for the cellar. It's fine now in rich fruit, but fairly tannic, and there's some tension of parts that 3–4 years should resolve. Shows very pure, focused black currant and cedar flavors, liberally dusted with peppery spices. The challenge with these big Zins is balance, which Sanctuary's '06 achieves.",Mariah Vineyard,93,25.0,California,Mendocino Ridge,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Zinfandel,Sanctuary
95234,US,"An extraordinarily rich, tannic and dry wine, which despite its big structure is relieved by potent flavors of cherries, blackberries, plums and cedar, with savory touches of anise, sage and black pepper. It's a complex, well-crafted wine that should develop in the bottle at least through 2014.",Three Palms Vineyard,93,85.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Duckhorn
95235,US,"Here's a big, thick, ripe Pinot Noir. It's not clearly a whole lot better than Morgan's regular Double L Pinot, which costs far less. But it is more powerful in the intensity of blackberries and cherries, as well as oak. If power in California Pinot Noir is your thing, go for it. Should age well for up to eight years.",Hat Trick Double L Vineyard,93,85.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Morgan
95236,US,"Very fine and high-toned, a Cabernet that shows real class and pedigree. Entirely drinkable now for its soft, lush tannins and elaborately detailed blackberry, black cherry, anise, carob and cedar flavors that last long through a spicy finish. Should age well through 2015.",Reserve,93,56.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Summers
95237,New Zealand,"Simply put, this is one of New Zealand's flagship reds, and it is a shame it is no longer being imported to the U.S. Lifted hints of dried flowers and herbs impart great complexity to the aromas, and the wine's cassis, cedar and chocolate flavors come across as intense without being overbearing. This is firmly structured, with plentiful but fine tannins. Drink 2015–2025.",Coleraine,93,,Hawke's Bay,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Te Mata
95238,US,"Easily the best Merlot in memory from Lake County, this one stands next to anything from Napa Valley, which is just over the hill from the vineyard. Shows a gorgeous tannin structure, with ripe, complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, red currants, mocha, green olives and cedar.",Tephra Ridge Vineyard,93,40.0,California,Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Merlot,Langtry
95239,US,"Tastes and feels like all the parts are very good. The tannins are polished, the fruit is ripe and complex, the oak is elaborate, and there's a nice bite of acidity in the background. The blackberry, black currant, carob and cedar flavors are enticing and dry. But this wine is too young. It has a youthful rudeness that demands 5–7 years in the cellar. The score reflects potential.",The Philanthropist Yountville Estate Vineyard,93,52.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Markham
95240,US,"Longplay's 2008 reserve is quite different from its non-¬reserve stablemate. The aromas include more earthy barnyard scents, the color has a hint of maturity, and no new oak was used. As a result, this wine could pass for one with a few more years under its belt; its flavors more suggestive of fruit pastry, figs and plums, leather and compost. Complex and detailed, it's a lovely effort.",Jory Bench Reserve Lia's Vineyard,93,30.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Longplay
95241,US,"Delicious and appealing, a palate-flattering wine that offers a gorgeous structure. Waves of black cherries, raspberries, cola, sweet rhubarb pie, persimmon and pomegranate flood the palate, and then a crisp gate of acidity slams down on the finish, although the spices get through and linger long. Best now for sheer exuberance.",Liberty Bridge Split Rock Vineyard,93,45.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Calicaro
95242,New Zealand,"In 2008, the Block 3 tannins are so silky and refined they give a soft, luscious character to the wine that's incredibly appealing. Spice, black cherry and cola notes finish long and complex. Drink now–2015.",Block 3,93,80.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Felton Road
95243,Spain,"Outstanding Sherry with complexity, richness and character. The nose has a salinic zest to it, making it no wallflower, and of course there's raisin and prune. The palate is formed, sculpted and balanced, with peanut M&M;'s candy, roasted fruit, chocolate ice cream and more. A beauty with power and poise.",Matusalem Oloroso Dulce Viejo,93,45.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,González Byass
95244,US,"Beautifully soft and limpid. So pretty and polished now, with ultrafine tannins framing ripe, dry flavors of black and red cherries, currants, chocolate, herbs and smoky sandalwood.

95245,US,"When Petite Sirah is at its best, and this one is, it offers incomparable structure and flavors. Nothing quite like it anywhere, with its inky dark color, big, thick tannins and ripe, exuberant flavors of berries, currants, mocha, leather, tobacco, cedar and peppery spices. What's especially nice about this bottling is the dryness and moderate alcohol. A superior wine that should age for the better part of a decade.",,93,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Petite Sirah,Summers
95246,US,"Four vineyards – Ribbon Ridge, Momtazi, Maresh and Shea – are included here. Soft and seductive, this wine caresses the palate with silky fruit. Aromatically it weaves together red fruits, truffles and clean, earthy scents. It reaches just over 13% alcohol; truly Burgundian yet with an Oregon flair to the fruit flavors. It puts the lie to any notion that this was a poor vintage. Challenging to be sure, but great wines were made in 2007, and this is one of them.",La Paulée,93,30.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Scott Paul
95247,Spain,"This is the tier-two wine from the Egurens' new Toro project, and it's stellar. Intense aromas of black fruit, char and mint start it out, and next up come cola, roasted black fruit, clove and cured-meat flavors. Oak is forward now, but it should settle in a year or so. A dynamite Toro to drink from 2011 through 2018.",Victorino,93,71.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
95248,US,"Dominique Lafon consults on these wines, sourced from a vineyard now almost 30 years old.  Evening Land is among the wineries who sense an opportunity to make refined, elegant wines from the terroir of this little-known region. Lovely aromas, complex scents and flavors, pine and herb, cranberry and raspberry, earth and seafoam—lots of nuances here.",Seven Springs Vineyard La Source,93,67.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Evening Land
95249,Spain,"A wonderfully balanced and giving wine with sweet raisin and prune aromas and an overall richness akin to crude oil. Flavors of baked black plum, brown sugar and molasses are both juicy and rich, and then toffee and mocha take over on the finish. Sweet and thick for sure, but with discernible fruit and vitality.",Noe Viejo,93,45.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Pedro Ximénez,González Byass
95250,Spain,"Fairly gassy and sulfuric off the bat, so the nose isn't ideal. Patience will be partially rewarded with jammy strawberry and raspberry flavors along with mocha. However, it never does fully get rolling. It settles on solid but midlevel red-fruit flavors and a similar mouthfeel.",,85,18.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Gazur

95252,Italy,"Here is a bigger, broader style of Italian rosé (made from a blend of Primitivo, Aglianico and Syrah) with thick aromas of raspberry, blueberry, mature peach and almond. Its color is bright pink and the wine offers a playful note of sour cherry on the close.",Passerose,85,15.0,Southern Italy,Puglia,,Rosé,Feudi di Terra d'Otranto
95253,Austria,"A peppery wine, all spice, nutmeg and black pepper. The tannins are tight, slightly green, but the juiciness is all there. Very fresh, very fruity.",Klassik,85,,Burgenland,,,Zweigelt,Hans Moser
95254,Spain,"An ordinary but competent Rioja. The fruit is light but young and fresh; the palate touches on raspberry and plum. A bit of mineral and natural bitterness work the finish, and overall this is a no-complaints kind of $10 wine.",Monte Clavijo,85,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Criadores de Rioja
95255,US,"Tastes too oaky and extracted, making the sweet wood, butterscotch, pear jam, peach cobbler and pineapple custard flavors a little obvious. But it will satisfy fans of this style.",,85,35.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Davis Family
95256,US,"Seems a little of the soft, sweet side, an easy wine to appreciate for its cherry, raspberry and cola flavors.",Kite's Rest Vineyard Redwoods' Edge,85,48.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Black Kite
95257,Spain,"Slightly reduced but still balanced enough to give off a positive early impression. The wine is sweet, almost syrupy, but it's that same ripeness that gives it more oomph and richness than most under-$10 wines. Finishes baked and almost stewy, but if you get at it early it should deliver all the black fruit and size one can expect from a value-priced offering.",Reinares,85,8.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Eguren
95258,Italy,"This is good example of the potential of Calabria's Greco Bianco grape. The wine is crisp and fresh and bursting with enticing notes of fruit, honey and mineral. You'll get citrus tones followed by cleansing flavors of lime and grapefruit.",,85,21.0,Southern Italy,Calabria,,Greco Bianco,Statti
95259,US,"This is a fresh, approachable style of Viogner, offering a combination of apple, honey and toast on the nose and balanced flavors of curvy fruit and flowers on the palate. The viscous mouthfeel and lingering finish give the wine an opulent appeal. Not terribly complex, but good overall.",,85,28.0,Virginia,Virginia,,Viognier,The Williamsburg Winery

95262,Spain,"Slightly prickly and peppery on the nose, but there's enough clean red-fruit aromas and dustiness to bring it along. The palate is simple and nice enough, with tight acidity, stanching dryness and zest. A good but limited wine that delivers what it should but nothing beyond that.",,84,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Darien
95263,Spain,"Dry melon and papaya aromas are common and proper for Cava. The palate, however, is ultrasweet and is weighted down by the wine's dosage. In the end, it's a candied type of bubbly that finishes cloyingly sweet and creamy. Best for fans of sweet white wines.",Brut Jove,84,13.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Família Oliveda

95267,Spain,"Mildy green and drying on the nose, with bramble and leather along with distant red fruit. The palate is soft, light and fluid, with mild raspberry and plum flavors.

95268,Italy,"Tones of almond, hazelnut and natural rubber give this golden wine thicker density and a heavier impression overall.

95269,US,"An elegant nose of deep spice and fruit leads on this Meritage from the Snake River Valley of Idaho—an emerging region to watch for interesting reds.

95270,Spain,"A little sluggish on the nose, but if you concentrate on the feel and overall balance the wine grades out fairly well. The flavors run from pickled raspberry to salty plum, and never is the wine very sweet or rich. Conversely, it settles on tight and lean, with juiciness rather than pulp.",Añada,84,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Lar de Paula

95274,Spain,"Quite tannic and biting, but beyond those mouthfeel issues this affordable RDD has its positives. The bouquet of toast, mocha and coconut is alluring, and then the palate of dark-fruit flavors, while rock-hard, is masculine. But never does one escape the feel and balance shortcomings. It's a like a ride down a pocked and bumpy gravel road.",Monte Castrillo,84,13.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Torremilanos
95275,US,"This blend of Cabernet Franc and the light, fruit and acidic Austrian variety Lemberger is on the whole  successful, displaying a unique, masculine nose of deep cherry and leathery spice.

95277,Spain,"Warm and earthy at first, but more soupy as it opens. Crisp, snappy red-fruit flavors are also on the herbal side. Nervy yet it does show a reasonable amount of honest Rioja quality.

95278,Spain,"Young and bouncy, and that's to be expected from this type of juvenile Tempranillo. However, should you like full-fruit young wines with force and no oak, it's not at all bad. Expect juicy black cherry and other runaway flavors.",,84,11.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza
95279,Spain,"Simultaneously snappy and creamy on the nose.

95283,US,"This is a small-production blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc made by a winemaker who knows a lot about Bordeaux blends, Genevieve Janssens, the longtime vintner at Robert Mondavi. It's ripe and pretty tannic, with cassis and smoky, 100% new oak flavors. An ambitious wine, it's quite good, and needs time in the cellar to soften and resolve.

95293,US,"This is just the second vintage of the Lumière Chardonnay from this rising star winery, and it is already causing a buzz. Washington produces very few high end white wines that would be natural companions to its reds on a restaurant wine list. This tight, precise, concentrated and focused Chardonnay fills that need. Though loaded with tropical and stone fruit flavors, this retains its acidic spine and finishes with plenty of toasty, buttered nut, barrel flavors.",Lumière,91,40.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Sparkman
95294,US,"Just four barrels of this reserve Merlot were made, and it's a solid step up from the excellent regular bottling.

95300,US,"The blend is 84% Merlot, the rest split evenly between Cabs Franc and Sauvignon. It's a dark and smoky wine, with tight, buttoned-up scents of cassis, raspberry and pomegranate. The fruit broadens into ripe cherry in the mouth, with generous dusty/toasty flavors of new oak. As the wine breathes there are  suggestions of mushroom, tobacco and lead pencil.

Drink now.",,91,15.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Drylands
95302,US,"Dark in color and plushly scented, this shows fruit and earth. Upon opening it remains quite tight and slightly hot in the finish; it needs to be decanted early.

95374,Chile,"A similar wine to the $13 Reserva, except more oaky and more driving. Not exactly toasty or vanilla-laden on the nose, but there is a noticeable barrel influence.

95402,South Africa,"While this is certainly on the higher end of South African Shiraz price points, it's worth the investment. The intense bouquet is loaded with rich dark cherry, raspberry, sweet spice and small wild strawberries. All-spice and pepper dominate the creamy mouth, with opulent flavors of meaty plum, roasted espresso and black cherry guts. Full and powerful in the mouth with a strong vanilla-accented finish. Delicious now but worthy of cellar time as well.",The Stork,92,79.0,Stellenbosch,,,Shiraz,Hartenberg

95407,US,"Quilceda's Palengat is now a proprietary blend, not a strict Cabernet as before. You can smell the violets amidst nicely layered aromatics, built upon layers of black fruits, cassis and dark, smoky elements. Smoke, earth, coffee, a hint of iron and rock continue into the midpalate, which loses a little density as it moves through the finish.

95411,US,"Somewhat crude and angular now, but then again, it's Petite Sirah, and mountain-grown at that.

95416,US,"Lushly aromatic and toasty, the substantial oak flavors are set against deep, brambly berry and cassis fruits.

The tannins are big and ripe and not at all bitter or too heavy.",Protagonist,92,50.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,J. Bookwalter
95417,US,"A vigorous, masculine Pinot Noir. Dark in color, tannic and acidic, it has the weight of Grenache, although with silkier tannins. The flavors are impressively ripe and deep, suggesting raspberries, cherries, currants and a baked pie crust quality from oak. A bit ponderous now.

95418,US,"Bone dry, ultra-crisp in acidity, and lean in mineral flavors, this barrel-fermented, lees-aged Roussanne is the opposite of rich.

95419,US,"Made in a leaner, acidic, minerally style, this bone-dry wine feels ultra-clean and distinguished in the mouth. It's austere, but you'll find a core of pineapples, apples and limes.

95421,US,"Always an interesting wine, and one that's made to drink with food. Dry and balanced, it shows flavors of blackberries, herbs and oak, with a soft, velvety mouthfeel.

95425,US,"This Cab is drinking very dry, tannic and austere in its youth.

95541,New Zealand,"The bulkiness that characterized earlier vintages of this Merlot-based blend has been tamed in this vintage, and the 2007 is a remarkably harmonious, elegant blend of ripe cherries, dried spices, chocolate and cedar.

95620,France,"This is a serious wine, tight and closed up at this stage. Around the dry core, the fruit is structured, not offering richness, but with a good, solid base of black currants. It needs time to soften.",,90,,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Durfort-Vivens
95621,France,"It's impressive how the new wood, which tasted overpowering in barrel, has now integrated. Yes, it is firm and toasty, but the sweet Merlot shows well, as do the tense fruit tannins. A wine to age.",,90,,Bordeaux,Pomerol,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Gazin
95622,France,"A terrific example of Corbières terroir at an unbeatable price. The wine, a traditional Rhône-style blend of Syrah, Grenache and Carignan, is so loaded with aromas and flavors of the surrounding garrigue you might think that they threw in a bouquet garni during maturation. Sage, rosemary,menthol, thyme and bay leaves all abound while rich, dark fruit and oak aging (Élevé en Fûts de Chêne means aged in oak barrels) provides support and structure.

95623,US,"Bergevin Lane's wines show a rich mix of herbal and earth flavors, with ripe but not overly sweet fruit. This 100% varietal Syrah is herbaceous and aromatic, with rich scents that mix the purple fruits with intimations of herb, chocolate and cracker.

Once it breathes open, it's perfectly balanced and drinkable right now.",,90,26.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Bergevin Lane
95624,US,"Lemon oil and candle wax add interesting nuances to the citrusy, barrel-fermented fruit. There was no malolactic fermentation; it's bone dry and the acids are all natural and smooth.

95625,US,"Spicy and a little hot right after opening, this wine breathes into shape, firming up with classic Red Mountain fruit flavors of plum and cherry, laced with graphite and accented with new oak.

95626,France,"Dark and concentrated, with aromas of kirsch, blackberry, carnation, sage and menthol.

95629,Germany,"This selection of Huber Spätburgunders was a pleasant surprise, although the prices are enough to make one groan.

95633,US,"All the fruit is from Wahluke Slope vineyard, with 2% Viognier. Aged for 17 months in French oak, this is a big step up from the 2005. The fruit scents are bold and pure, showing lush berry notes and leading gracefully into a darker mix of smoke, coffee grounds, tobacco and licorice.

95634,Austria,"A Pannobile blend is one that is tasted and approved by a group of producers in Gols, on the north shore of Lake Neusiedl.

95674,US,"The winemaker calls this a “more masculine wine: richer, bigger,” which almost understates the case. It's fruity to the point of bomb, offering an orchard of ripe red cherries, raspberries, red plums, cola and something tropically sweet, like red mango.

95679,South Africa,"Smoke, pepper and spice give this sprightly Shiraz a smoldering edge.

95831,US,"Peju's regular Cab Franc, released a year ago, was immediately drinkable. This reserve, with a tiny case production, is denser and more tannic, but shows the same charm.

95835,US,"Marked by a lean minerality, this Chablis-style wine is not one of those fat, opulent Chards that dazzles with sheer richness. It's more subtle than that, and more acidic. Structure, in fact, is the name of the game here, with its lemon and lime flavors that barely break into green apples. Fine now, if not served too cold, and for the next 2–4 years.

95852,Spain,"The first couple of passes are not that encouraging: there's strawberry Kool-Aid and sharp field-like aromas of thistle and bramble.

95855,US,"There's a lot to praise and also lots to criticize in this Cab. It's richly tannic and nicely oaked, with lush black currant and smoky oak flavors.

95864,Australia,"De Bortoli's unique approach to harvest timing and extensive use of new oak leaves this wine seeming rather disjointed: coffee and cola notes dominate the tart, cranberryish fruit flavors.

Finishes crisp, with lingering notes of lemon and orange.",,91,36.0,Central Otago,,,Chardonnay,Felton Road
95885,US,"The blend is 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 42% Merlot, 11% Syrah and a splash of Cab Franc. This is nicely sculpted, with the typical plush midpalate, matching crisp red berries to butterfat. The fruit is sleek and has an underpinning of mineral and accents of fennel. Though the alcohol tops out at a hefty 14.7%, the fruit can handle it.",Riverbend Red,91,32.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Fielding Hills
95886,US,"This is a gem from winemaker Bob Bertheau; Syrah seems to be his red. Sharp, spicy and beautifully precise, this is packed with tart berries and peppery spice. The new oak builds in more spice and sweet toast, while the tannins add earth and leaf to the mix. It's supple and forward and fruit driven, with power and precision.",Ethos,91,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Chateau Ste. Michelle
95887,US,"Made in the Sleepy Hollow style, extraordinarily ripe, almost botrytized in apricot and honey flavors like a dessert wine, except that it's bone dry. Really epitomizes this vineyard and corner of Monterey, where Chard ripens to beautifully while maintaining acidity.",Sleepy Hollow Vineyard,91,39.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Testarossa
95888,US,"The blend includes 9% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Malbec, all estate-grown. The aromas are intense and seductive, layered with flower, berry and clove. Dense and youthful, the wine has compact black fruits, streaks of smoke and a strong flavor of clove. It's a big wine, with mass and depth. The new oak is pulled back relative to this winery's earlier vintages, to good effect, and the fruit can more than carry it. It changes rapidly in the glass, suggesting that once it's past its baby fat stage it will show still more complexity, while retaining an elegant precision.",,91,50.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Pepper Bridge
95889,Chile,"With each passing year this Syrah rosé gets better and better. Yet some things remain the same, like the color, which is almost red, and the clarity, which is nearly perfect. Put this in your mouth and we'll bet you get no indication that it's Chilean. It's a ripe but balanced example of long and lasting rosé; and it will go with almost anything on your plate. A real winner from South America.",Cherub Rosé of,91,16.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Syrah,Montes
95890,US,"This is Walla Walla Vintners' signature wine, and it is a classic: rich and oaky, sculpted but also chewy, with big cherry and baking chocolate flavors. There is an unusual flavor streak running through that tastes a bit like Thanksgiving turkey, believe it or not, but it's good. Tannins are polished and the toffee and chocolate finish ends things on a sweet and creamy note.",,91,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Franc,Walla Walla Vintners
95891,Italy,"You'll appreciate the streamlined and compact character of this Cab-Merlot blend that ultimately helps establish its harmony and balance. In terms of aromas, it offers bright cherry fruit, forest berry, blueberry, spice and lightly toasted coffee bean. The oak element becomes more obvious in the mouth where the wine also showcases silky tannins and chewy fruit.",Sogno dell'Uva,90,99.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Cennatoio
95892,US,"Easton's basic Zin offers plenty of delicious pleasure. It's a dry, smoothly tannic wine, packed with wild blackberry, mulberry, mocha and (believe it or not) ollallieberry flavors, which perhaps suggests a certain rural, old-fashioned quality. The wine is also superspicy in white pepper and nutmeg. Great value.",,90,15.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Easton
95893,New Zealand,"Full-bodied, lush and velvety, this Merlot-based blend from winemaker Steve Smith, MW, features aromas and flavors of smoke, roasted coffee and black cherries underscored by plummier notes. Finishes with dark chocolate flavors and a touch of warmth.",Sophia Gimblett Gravels,90,55.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Craggy Range
95894,US,"A lightly pétillant ice wine. Harvested at almost 38 brix, it is not as dense and racy as the ice wines of British Columbia or eastern Canada, but it offers its own pleasures. Here are details of sweet straw, rice cracker, caramel and honey, nicely interwoven and persistent, and never turning cloying or sugary.",Chenin Blanc Ice Wine,90,45.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,White Blend,Chateau Ste. Michelle
95895,US,"Creamy with a smooth streak of rich butterscotch, this is a very appealing wine that seems to gather strength as it slides through the mouth. It hits a whopping 15.3% alcohol, and yet retains a silky feel and a nice mix of peach, apricot and papaya fruits. It just goes on and on, almost like a dessert wine without the sugar.",,90,20.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Airfield Estates
95896,US,"A pace off the 2005, this single-vineyard wine, from the Sebastopol area, shows enormously ripe, powerful flavors of cherries, blackberries, raspberries, cola and vanilla. Fortunately, acidity is quite high, giving all that rich flavor a crisp bite.",Hallberg Vineyard,90,55.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Halleck
95897,Australia,"An excellent value, Hardys' Oomoo Shiraz can run with a pack twice its price, offering earth and cola aromas and a deep undercurrent of blackberries. It's full-bodied, mouthfilling yet structured. Adds flavors of black olives to the mix, along with velvety tannins and mouthwatering acids on the finish.",Oomoo,90,15.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Hardys
95898,New Zealand,"Part of a new line of single-vineyard wines from New Zealand's largest winery, this Rapaura-grown Sauvignon Blanc is herbal upfront, verging on peppery, but balances that component with flavors of underripe stone fruit and white grapefruit. It's full-bodied and creamy without being heavy, finishing long and fresh despite the weight.",Conders Forest,90,22.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Brancott
95899,US,"Fragrant and liquorous, this opens with scents of berry and cherry and spice, lightly lifted with floral accents. The wine is a pretty ruby color, and it walks the line between open and closed, poised right on the fence. There is a sharp spicy streak, which wraps into the graphite and mineral character of the vineyard.",Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine,90,40.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Cadence
95900,US,"This is a true reserve, richer and more complex than Bargetto's regular Merlot. Shows dense flavors of black raspberries, currants, cherries, chocolate and vanilla, wrapped into firm but accessible tannins, and finishes thoroughly dry and spicy. Best now and for a year or two.",Reserve,90,35.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Merlot,Bargetto
95901,US,"Following the shortfall of grapes in 2004, this is a welcome return to a widely-available, sappy and fragrant Walla Walla Syrah at an affordable price. Fragrant and pleasingly floral, it immediately sends up scents of citrus and pepper, following with tart berries and plenty of snappy acidity. The wine expands beautifully in the glass and tastes great even after being open for a full 24 hours.",,90,26.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Amavi
95902,Chile,"One of Chile's most honest producers of varietally correct Pinot is Kingston Family.

Ready to drink now.",Alazan,90,28.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Pinot Noir,Kingston Family
95903,US,"It's necessary to talk about alcohol levels with Saxum's wines, because they define the style. With this one, it's 16.4%, higher than almost any commercially-released red table wine in California. That's almost Port. It's vast in chocolate, raspberry purée, cherry jam, anisette and cassis flavors. That makes it sound sweet, but it's dry and smoothly tannic. Saxum fans will exult. Others may find the wine problematic.",James Berry Vineyard Rocket Block,90,55.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,Saxum
95904,US,"Spann's track record for soft, appealing Cabs is unbroken with this very pretty and polished ‘04. With a wealth of blackberry, currant, mocha and spice flavors, it shows real complexity. Despite the softness, it will develop and hold for a decade or more.",Twenty Three Barrels,90,32.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Spann Vineyards
95905,US,"You might think of a Sonoma Coast Pinot as one marked by high, cool-climate acidity, but this is quite a soft wine. It's also a luscious one, marked by fruit flavors of cherries, currants, raspberries, pomegranates, persimmons and cola. The vineyard is in the eastern part of this sprawling appellation.",La Cruz Vineyard,90,54.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
95906,France,"Full and ripe, certainly as befits Meursault from a great year, but this wine also has deliciously crisp acidity which adds an element of minerality, of poise, to the smooth toast and cream texture. An enticing, structured wine.",,90,80.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Pierre Morey

95908,US,"This is all Lewis Vineyard Cabernet, though not as strong as the vineyard-designated bottling from the same vintage. There is noticeable volatility in the opening aromas, which slowly blows off and turns into concentrated raspberry, boysenberry, plum and cherry compote fruit. Dense and buoyed with firm acids, this wine needs a full 24 hours to smooth out. There is plenty of well-managed oak, adding smoky coffee and espresso to the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon X,90,45.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dunham
95909,Chile,"Emiliana began as Vinedos Organicos Emiliana, but now goes only by Emiliana because getting certified as an organic winery proved too difficult. Still, Emiliana's vineyards are organically farmed, and this five-grape blend made by Alvaro Espinoza is intense and extracted yet still finely knit. It's a serious wine with slight herbal/pine aromas, robust red-fruit flavors, and a smooth, stylish finish. Not overdone, so drink now.",Coyam,90,30.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Red Blend,Emiliana

95911,US,"A good wine in a difficult year, this estate-grown Cabernet does not lean heavily on new oak, nor does it need to. Blackberry, cassis and earth form the solid core, and there are substantial, natural-tasting acids providing support. The neutral barrels were half American and half French, but it's the fruit and vineyard that are most on display.",Spofford Station Estate,90,36.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,JLC

95914,US,"The latest Métier is 100% Viognier, all from Ciel du Cheval on Red Mountain. The lack of Roussanne in the blend takes away some subtle level of complexity, and this wine, though ripe and extracted and quite seductive, seems a bit one-dimensional. It's a really, really good dimension however, with lush peachy fruit and generous dollops of vanilla cracker and toast.",Métier White,90,34.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,White Blend,Doyenne
95915,Italy,"Light and tonic in appearance, this Etna-based wine is a profound expression of elegance. You'll get drying mineral tones backed by blue flower and sweet almond nut.

95916,US,"A picture-perfect mix of fruit, acid, stone and tannin.

95918,France,"The Moulin Saint-Georges vineyard is next to that of Ausone and run by the same team. That makes this deliciously structured wine a great buy.

95920,France,"This shows the results of how well Grand-Puy-Ducasse has developed over recent years. This 2006 shows the fruit of the vintage—black cherries, berries and dark Cabernet plums. It has a good density of texture, which promises some aging.",,90,,Bordeaux,Pauillac,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Grand-Puy Ducasse
95921,US,"Despite the California appellation, the grapes were grown in the Ojai region of Santa Barbara County.

95923,Australia,"A bit unyielding on the nose, then the palate shows rather tight and citrusy flavors. Yet there's ample weight on the palate and a long, fresh finish tinged with hard peaches and pineapple. This seemingly contradictory wine just needs some time to develop; try after 2009.",No. 11,90,30.0,New South Wales,Orange,,Chardonnay,Philip Shaw
95924,US,"Better known as a Zinfandel house, Sausal can sometimes surprise with their richly soft, intricately layered Cabs, and the '04 is just that.

95925,Austria,"There's no question about the huge richness of this wine—it is there from the initial aroma. It is smooth, totally voluptuous, immediately appealing. The flavors are of the sweetest runny honey, matched with acidity to emphasize the ripe peach and dried apricot flavors.",Trockenbeerenauslese,90,30.0,Burgenland,,,Chardonnay,Rosenhof
95926,France,"There is a high proportion of Merlot in this wine, and it shows in its ripe softness, with a depth of sweetness that goes all the way through.

95928,Chile,"Attractive and very much in the vein of what is really good Chilean Sauvignon Blanc. The bouquet is all about green herbs, cactus pad, passion fruit and citrus. The palate transitions from lemon-lime to tropical pineapple and passion fruit, while the finish is breezy and zesty. It is a lean, 100% Casablanca style of SB, and while it's a step down from the great 2007, the drop is not a big one.",Los Vascos,89,14.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite)

95931,France,"A smoky, perfumed wine, dominated by the proportion of Cabernet Franc. There is prominent wood here, particularly in the aromas, but they are challenged by the black currant fruits. The ripe, sweet fruit gives an immediate freshness and juiciness to the finish.",Le Petit Mouton de Mouton Rothschild,89,,Bordeaux,Pauillac,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Mouton Rothschild
95932,France,"A wine that is dominated by big, dense tannins. The black currant fruits come through with a stalky character. As it opens in the mouth, the wine shows some richness, along with its tannins, a hint of wood giving a smooth, elegant edge to the finish. It does need aging—four to five years.",,89,28.0,Bordeaux,Haut-Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Paloumey
95933,Austria,"Rieslings from the Burgenland need very specific locations to keep their crispness and varietal distinctiveness.

95934,New Zealand,"As all the Icon Pinot Noirs have over the years, this one shows a fair amount of oak: cinnamon, toast and vanilla all mark the nose.

95936,US,"Young, tight and sharp, showing lots of black currant, along with pepper and spice. Maybe just a notch below the excellent 2004 L'Etalon Red.

95937,US,"This has a great nose, with bright cherry and berry fruit. Berry, black cherry, coffee and earth components combine in a pleasing and muscular blend.

95938,France,"Ripe red raspberry notes, accented by cocoa, a chalky minerality and a hint of orange zest liven up the medium weight. With ample acidity and strong tannins, this wine will only improve with some time; you can tell that it's holding back and there's so much more that hasn't fully developed.

95948,US,"Tough and gritty now, due to a combination of hard skin and seed tannins and unintegrated new oak.

96141,France,"Now owned by Château Labégorce-Margaux, this classed growth is beginning to come back to life.

96143,France,"Big, rich, dusty tannins and black plum fruits are built on a firm layer of wood. There is a fresh mint character as well, giving the wine a polished and spicy feel. With the wood and the acidity, this needs aging: 3–4 years and more.",Réserve,91,,Bordeaux,Graves,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Haut Selve
96144,Italy,"This wine is a result of careful winemaking in which both oak barrel and aging on the lees is used to render a rounder, creamier feel in the mouth.

96146,US,"Bella Vetta's 2005 was very good. This 2006 is easily on a par. It's a ripe, plush wine, filled with blackberry, currant and sweet oak flavors with a savory tease of leather that may be a touch of brett, but it acts as a spice.

96312,New Zealand,"Eradus continues a successful run with this year's Sauvignon Blanc. As usual, it's fairly pungent and herbal upfront, but then delivers waves of passion fruit.

96313,Chile,"Starts out foxy and mossy, with leather, char, earth and herbal notes. The palate is nothing if not saturated and big, and the flavors run toward baked, meaty black fruits.

96315,US,"This is still a little hard and tight, but shows great ripe red berry fruit and well-balanced tannins.

96317,US,"Lots of crisp, citrusy acidity in this wine, which brightens the pineapple, orange, lemon and lime flavors. Meanwhile, 100% new oak adds a rich coating of smoky, buttered toast.

96402,Italy,"Light golden in color, this has ripe aromas of stone fruit, apricot, honey, grapefruit and dried herb. It has freshness and structure, and the finish lasts for many long minutes.",Balciana,88,,Central Italy,Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore,,Verdicchio,Sartarelli
96403,Italy,"There's a touch of dark spice and cured meat at the start that is followed by fruitier notes of blackberry and plum. This shows smooth tannins and nice richness, making it a good pairing partner to potato gnocchi with gorgonzola cheese sauce.",,88,22.0,Central Italy,Montefalco Rosso,,Red Blend,Benincasa
96404,US,"Crisp and lean, with mineral, lemon and ripe grapefruit flavors, this is enriched with a sweet note of honey. The acidity is keen, and while the wine is a little severe, it's so elegant. Drink now.",Churner,88,24.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Amos Cellars
96405,Italy,"A blend of Sangiovese and Canaiolo, this is a richly concentrated red that would pair with pork, lamb or hearty lasagna with beef sauce. An easy dinner wine to share with friends, it is redolent of blackberry, spice and cured meat.",Anima Umbra,88,13.0,Central Italy,Umbria,,Red Blend,Arnaldo Caprai
96406,US,"This polished wine is rich, dry and pretty much as complex as Grenache manages to get in California. With the weight of a silky Pinot Noir, it has pleasant cherry, teriyaki beef and white pepper flavors, with a touch of overripe raisin on the finish.",,88,42.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Grenache,Austin Hope
96407,US,"Textbook Viognier—this is ripe and exotic in tropical fruit, white flower and honey flavors. It's technically dry, but so rich you'd swear there was some residual sugar. With its strong texture and full body, this is an interesting alternative to a big Chardonnay.",,88,22.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Viognier,10 Knots
96408,France,"A blend of Cabernet Franc and Tannat, this is spicy, smoky and herbal. It is dense, with a green, stalky edge that comes from the acidity and black tannins. Age for two years.",Donibane,88,24.0,Southwest France,Irrouléguy,,Red Blend,Lionel Osmin & Cie
96409,Italy,"A a blend of Sangiovese, Canaiolo and Colorino, this opens with a tangy bouquet that's redolent of wild berry, dried ginger, cola and licorice. Easy drinking and smooth, this has fresh acidity on the finish.",Rubesco,88,15.0,Central Italy,Torgiano,,Red Blend,Lungarotti

96417,Italy,"Tommasi is a celebrated producer based in Valpolicella, but in recent years the family has invested heavily in Maremma, Tuscany, to produce a solid line of value-driven wines from the region.

96420,New Zealand,"Dry River's 2007 Pinot Noir reveals a slight herbal tinge to its dark fruit aromas and flavors, but it's a nuance that adds complexity and should develop into hints of tea and spice with additional bottle age. As always, it's not overly big or richly textured, but it is concentrated and intense. Drink 2012–2020.",,91,90.0,Martinborough,,,Pinot Noir,Dry River
96421,US,"This is a delight—a supple, polished, ripe and full-throttle Pinot Noir offered at a mid-1990s price. Winemaker Aron Hess keeps the alcohol at 13.5%, the oak a moderate 20% new, and the earthy underpinnings gracefully in check. Lush purple and blue fruits are lightly licked with chocolate; the result is a very satisfying mouthful of wine.",Lia's Vineyard,91,24.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Longplay
96422,Spain,"Rich, dense and syrupy, but also showing touches of mint and leather on the nose. Quite sticky in the mouth, but with lovely toffee and mocha flavors that set up a finish that runs on and on. Impressive depth of flavor, nice overall balance and a mix of complexity and flat-out richness make this PX a winner.",Nectar Dulce,91,18.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Pedro Ximénez,González Byass
96423,US,"Though it seems quite light on first impression, that is a bit deceptive. The biodynamic grapes show a muted earthiness, while over time the cranberry and raspberry flavors gain focus and concentration in the mouth. A graceful, nicely proportioned wine, with some stem and grip to the tannins.",Momtazi Vineyard,91,40.0,Oregon,McMinnville,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Kelley Fox
96424,US,"Bold and striking aromas of mushroom, seaweed and organic funk set this apart from the other Ken Wright vineyard designates. There's plenty of tart, tangy cherry fruit also, though it seems to hit a wall, perhaps due to the recent bottling. This is a wine that could score even higher with additional bottle age.",Meredith Mitchell Vineyard,91,50.0,Oregon,McMinnville,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Ken Wright
96425,New Zealand,"A terrific Pinot Noir value, Stonecrop's 2008 exhibits smoky, cedary aromas, but balances the oak with a solid foundation of cherry fruit and savory, mushroomy complexity. It's full bodied yet elegant, with a meaty finish. Drink now–2013.",,91,24.0,Martinborough,,,Pinot Noir,Stonecrop
96426,US,"Typical of a young, fine Petite Sirah, this bottle is too tannic and unintegrated to drink now. But it has a gigantic heart of blackberries, currants, chocolate, anise, leather and cedar, and should have no problem developing in the bottle over the next decade. Hold until after 2011.",,91,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Petite Sirah,Tres Sabores
96427,New Zealand,"Intriguingly floral and savory upfront, this delicate wine then adds a deep base of ripe cherries that expand effortlessly across the palate, giving an impression of fullness without weight, suppleness without being soft. Finishes long, with a great deal of complexity.",Waitaki Vineyard,91,55.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Valli
96428,Italy,"This is an intense and austere sparkling wine with persistent perlage and deep aromas of toast, roasted nut, honey, stone fruit and butterscotch.

96429,US,"Tastes young and jammy now, with perky, tartly sweet flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants. Oak adds smoky complexities that bring to mind mocha, vanilla and buttered toast, with a sprinkle of cinnamon. Somewhat lacking in nuance, with plenty of flash, this Cab should develop over the next 6–8 years.",Collector's Reserve Puerta Dorada Vineyard,91,120.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Martin Estate

96431,Spain,"Round, stylish and wholesome on the nose, with wild berry, smoke, spice and not too much obvious oak.

Drink now through 2015.",Fincas de Ganuza Reserva,91,48.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Remírez de Ganuza
96432,France,"A highly perfumed wine, with enticing aromas. The palate is tougher, unforgiving, the young structure there to support fresh and concentrated fruit. There is a definite wood element, but it is not overdone. For aging 3–4 years.",Prestige,91,47.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Bellerose Figeac
96433,US,"The balance and brightness are immediately apparent, with sweet raspberry and red cherry fruit against some lightly earthy tannins. All in proportion, yet with a bit of extra depth that suggests some ageworthiness. Everything is ripe, but not too ripe, and the acidity feels natural and proportionate.",Corral Creek,91,44.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Chehalem
96434,France,"The dry, hard tannins are very Saint-Estèphe, but the wine bears its weight well, giving good black plum and berry fruits and a dense texture. It has a solid, chunky feel to it, dark and firm. The finish is more fresh and juicy.",,91,,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Meyney
96435,US,"A rich, polished Cabernet. Doesn't taste particularly Oakville-like, due to extreme ripeness, softness, high alcohol and refined tannins that could come from anywhere, but it's well crafted and delicious. Offers waves of blackberries, black currants, chocolate and cedar. Now–2013.",,91,60.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Coniglio
96436,US,"Powerful vanilla scents rise from the glass, but the fruit, even in this difficult vintage, comes out immediately. It's tart and sharp, with a strong herbal component, and the wine snaps into focus quickly with fruit, acid, tannin, herb and vanilla in equal proportion. Firm and tight, still quite young, this wine needs decanting and/or further bottle age to show its best.",Seven Springs Vineyard,91,45.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Evening Land
96437,US,"Still quite young yet unmistakably lush, this bottling immediately shows fresh apples, white peach and plenty of new oak from 100% barrel fermentation. The lip-smacking acidity keeps fruit and oak in balance; all that is needed is a bit more bottle age. Decant it if you plan to drink it immediately.",Caitlin's Reserve,91,40.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay,Adelsheim
96438,Spain,"Dense and heavy, and maybe a touch dull on the nose in terms of fruit aromas. But once it hits the palate the wine shines with intense black fruit, sugar beet and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and warm, with saturation and texture. Almost over the edge as far as ripeness, but not quite. Drink now through 2012.",Vendimia Seleccionada,91,59.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,García Figuero
96439,Spain,"Another impressive Oloroso from Gonzalez Byass. This is a sweet, dark, brooding Sherry with prune and other sweet fruit aromas.

Sweet but balanced by mild coffee-like bitterness on the finish.",Solera 1847 Oloroso Dulce,91,18.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,González Byass
96440,Germany,"An expressive, extroverted style that still communicates a sense of place. There's loads of dried fruit character here, with apple, nectarine, rose and graham flour flavors that build to a long-lasting finish. Light-bodied, with a spice aftertaste. Drink now or hold five-plus years.",G Kabinett,91,29.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Johannishof
96441,New Zealand,"Gibbston is the coolest of Central Otago's subregions, and this wine reflects that in its delicate floral and herbal notes, even a touch of rhubarb. But there's also ample cherry fruit and a wonderfully lacy, silky texture. Long and crisp on the finish. Best from 2012–2018.",Gibbston Vineyard,91,55.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Valli
96442,US,"The vineyard name is a combination of the two prevalent soil types, Nekia and WillaKenzie. Along with sweet cherry fruit comes a defining minerality—a streak of iron running through the heart of the wine. Balanced nicely, with gentle acidity and sculpted tannins. In the finish you pick up an elegant streak of green tea.",Willakia Vineyard,91,35.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Soléna

96444,US,"A welcome trend in Oregon is making Pinot Noir at moderate alcohol levels—here it's 13.5%. This enhances the wine's details, beginning with the aromas. Cola and clove, licorice and toffee scents promise a tasty bottle that turns out to be bursting with black berries, black cherries, black currant and even black tea flavors.",Estate,91,50.0,Oregon,Yamhill-Carlton District,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Anne Amie
96445,US,"Powerful scents mix dried herb, wet grass and petrol—it could be mistaken for Sauvignon Blanc in a blind tasting, and it has that much density and extract. The label says dry, and it is certainly that, much in the Australian style. Big, concentrated, high acid and quite cellarworthy.",Dry,91,20.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Riesling,Amity Vineyards
96446,Spain,"Serious, stately Rioja with key aromas of prune, blackberry and leather. Snappy enough on the palate, with plenty of pop as well as pure berry flavors, smooth tannins, zest and dry vanilla. Some might call it a bit acidic and traditional, but with food it'll do great. Drink now through 2016. Only 250 cases made.",El Belisario,91,80.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Agrícola Labastida
96447,Germany,"Serious and earthy, like walking into a wall of minerality. The fruit takes a back seat here, but is lusciously peachy and fresh while the long finish is sparked by hints of exotic spices. Give this two to three years to show its best.",Graacher Himmelreich Spätlese,91,,Mosel,,,Riesling,Joh. Jos. Prüm
96448,Italy,"Ca' del Bosco is one of Italy's best producers of sparkling wine and this Brut expression show the deft hands of the staff winemakers.

96449,Italy,Here's a sophisticated and spicy sparkling wine from the 2004 vintage that boasts a clean and tonic delivery across the palate.

It's a simple, no-fuss, beautifully packaged wine with a subtle touch of bitter astringency on the close.",Negroamaro,83,,Southern Italy,Salento,,Rosé,Villa Mottura
96452,Spain,"Almost volatile, but with reduced raisin below. If you are familiar with   hot-climate California Zinfandel, this is not unlike that. It has a vinegary attack and then a strange but limited sweetness lurking in the weeds. A   challenged wine.",Javier Asensio Tinto,83,10.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Red Blend,Asensio
96453,US,"A candied nose of raspberry and pepper starts this wine out on a slightly clumsy note, but on the palate, the wine offers solid, if slightly simple, flavors. The finish impresses with its warm, spicy wave.",,83,19.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Sauvignon,Keuka Spring
96454,Australia,"With its ample body and complex touches of chocolate, plum and spice, this is clearly a serious attempt at rosé, just one that seems a bit tired at this stage of its evolution. Drink up.",Saignée Rosé,83,15.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,Shiraz,Margan
96455,US,"A pretty nose of violets, cherry and pepper start this fun and friendly wine from Virginia. On the palate, somewhat straightforward cherry and spice are flavorful and solid. A good wine that will pair nicely with spicier cuisine—think Middle Eastern or tomato-based Italian dishes.",,83,19.0,Virginia,Virginia,,Cabernet Franc,Chateau Morrisette
96456,Italy,"The wine's aromas are simple and rather monothematic and recall apple cider or pear juice. There's even a slight veil in its appearance and a gritty texture that further reinforces that pear juice impression. That said, Bisceglia is an up and coming modern winery and one worth keeping an eye on in the future.",,83,,Southern Italy,Basilicata,,Chardonnay,Bisceglia
96457,Spain,"Very dark and seemingly on the cooked side of the ledger. The nose is black and raisiny, while the core flavors are saucy. At least this meaty, overdone Garnacha isn't oaked, so in that sense it isn't offensive. But it is definitely soft, and without much future.",Viñas Viejas,83,11.0,Northern Spain,Calatayud,,Garnacha,Bodegas Agustín Cubero
96458,US,"A plucky nose of fruitcake and spice leads off. On the palate, good, robust red fruit, a solid, dry and minerally backbone and a touch of oak offer dimension and balance. A bit rough and ready, the wine will benefit from pairing with grilled meats or spicy dishes that can match its energy.",Calvin Clarion,83,28.0,New Mexico,New Mexico,,Red Blend,Casa Rondeña Winery
96459,Spain,"Airén is a big-crop white grape that is usually distilled into brandy or made into Sherry. But here we see it as a dry white table wine, and while it is limited in scope, the wine's punch-bowl approach and cleansing lime and kiwi flavors are decent.",,83,8.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Airen,Sierra Virgen
96460,Italy,"Nero Latino lacks harmony overall because of its rapid succession of unrelated aromas: Red apple is followed by mushroom, beets, strawberry, chocolate and smoke. It also has an extremely strong component of coffee rinds that appears on both the nose and in the mouth. It's not a wine for everyone.",Nero Latino,83,,Southern Italy,Irpinia,,Aglianico,Mier Vini

96462,Spain,"Apple and powdery citrus aromas are austere but intriguing. But in the mouth, this thing foams like bubble bath. No matter whether you like the wine's citric flavors and apple essence or not, the fact that it bubbles up like a shaken soda is not an attribute. Oriel's gran reserva is similar in terms of carbonation issues.",Brut,82,18.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Oriol Rossell
96463,US,"Though this wine offers the vibrant cherry fruit and pepper of a good New York Cab Franc, it's a bit one-dimensional. On the nose, candied cherry and spice lead, followed by a slightly tart wave of cherry. Oak adds just a bit of interest. Pair with duck or fowl to soften it.",,82,18.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Franc,Ravines

96465,US,"Affordable and friendly, this refreshing wine offers strawberry jam and orange marmalade on the nose and a mineral-driven flavor profile.

96466,US,"Unbalanced, with weedy, grassy flavors side by side with sweet spearmint chewing gum and pineapple LifeSaver candy. Crisp acidity gives it the sweet-sour taste of certain Chinese sauces.",Nouvelle Génération,82,24.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Taylor
96467,US,"This Cabernet Franc has a slightly watery, sweet fruit element that lacks the cheerful vibrancy and pluckiness of the variety. On the nose, it offers soft red fruit and some spice, but the flavors feel weak. Not a bad wine overall, but needs some muscle.",,82,17.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Franc,Sheldrake Point
96468,Spain,"Brambly and tart, with a peppery, leathery nose. It's zesty, lightly concentrated Garnacha with zingy, mouth-burning raspberry and plum flavors. A sharp, reticent wine in every way. Imported by USA Wine Imports.",Ladera,82,21.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Garnacha,Algairen
96469,Spain,"A lesson in contrasts: the nose is both weedy and sweet, with green strawberry aromas mixing with caramel. The palate is also green and slightly bitter, but that's offset by some jammy berry sweetness. Medium in terms of weight, but with burdensome sugars and a clumsy finish.",Vertus Crianza,82,15.0,Levante,Utiel-Requena,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Iranzo
96470,US,"With the heat of very high alcohol, the taste of overripe, raisiny fruit and a sweet finish, this is not a successful wine. But then, Mourvèdre is notoriously difficult to control.",El Alacran,82,35.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Mourvèdre,Karly
96471,US,"Cinnamon and spiced berry—a seductive combination—lead this Cab from the Finger Lakes, but on the palate, cherry, pepper and spice flavors fall a bit flat.

96476,US,"This Bordeaux-style red starts promisingly, with a big nose of smoky meat, tobacco and pepper, but on the palate, there's a slightly rubbery edge and the fruit needs more complexity.

96481,US,"Rollat's Sophie occupies the entry-level rung on the ladder, behind the elegant and polished Rollat and the dense, compact and highly cellar-worthy Edouard. But Sophie is charming and accessible, a blend of 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc that is elegant and bright. The fruit focus is on cranberry and raspberry, tart and well-defined, and the wine is immaculately clean. It's light and charming, but a perfect choice for autumnal foods.",Sophie de Rollat,89,29.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Chateau Rollat

96484,New Zealand,"Who would have believed that one day we'd have Sauvignon Blancs paying tribute to 1980s pop groups? At least both share a New Zealand connection.

Drink up.",,89,25.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Crowded House
96485,US,"The F5 bottling is proving to be a good one for Cuvaison. While the '06 doesn't have the structural complexity of the '05, it's a very fine Pinot Noir.

96488,Italy,"There's a flashy, flirtatious edge to this Morellino Riserva that puts the spotlight on ripe, succulent aromas of black cherry, blueberry and sweet spice.

96490,France,"Beautifully concentrated aromas precede flavors of violets, pepper, sweet spice, plum and red berries. The wine is full and round in the mouth with excellent acidity and tannin. A little tight and closed right now, it should open up to be even more balanced and better integrated in 2–3 years.",,89,38.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Minervois La Liviniere,,Rhône-style Red Blend,L'Ostal Cazes
96491,US,"It's sharp, young and citrusy, nicely spiced with herb and leavened with earth. The flavors are just beginning to blossom. Although it will continue to open up over the next year or more, showing more of the earthy, composty underpinnings, it doesn't seem to have the depth to develop significantly. It finishes with distinctly herbal and somewhat earthy tannins.",Wild Eyed,89,45.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Mark Ryan
96492,South Africa,"Plum, soft smoke, grilled meats—this is a masculine wine with a lovely, savory style.

96494,France,"An interesting, exotic wine, complex and layered. Butter,cream and caramel underlie apricot aromas while the intense palate shows peach, poached pear and lemon notes.

96495,US,"Interesting to see that Washington State vineyards can ripen Sangio in a wide range of microclimates; this is true to the variety with tart acids, sharp flavors of berry, hints of pumpkin pie spice and tobacco, and just enough butterscotch barrel notes to fill in around the rough edges. This is good winemaking, with a tough grape.",San Remo,89,26.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sangiovese,Des Voigne Cellars
96496,Austria,"A complex blend that moves this wine into an international style. The wine is smooth, generous, almost opulent. It emphasizes rich red plum flavors, rounded out with jelly sweetness, the acidity coming with the a final burst of freshness.

96497,Italy,"This Italian Malbec shows bright fruit flavors backed by drying mineral tones and bright cherry tones.

96498,US,"Mourvèdre is an awfully hard variety to get right in California, but Quivera has done an outstanding job. The wine is fully ripe, showing cassis, milk chocolate and pepperspice flavors, and it's also very soft, making it immediately drinkable. But it's the refined tannin structure that lifts it up.",Wine Creek Ranch,89,32.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Mourvèdre,Quivira
96499,Chile,"Veramonte knows how to capture the pungent, alert character inherent to Sauvignon Blanc. This is a peppy wine with spiky tropical and green-fruit aromas and flavors. It's a mash up of citrus and nettles, with a controlled, fairly long grapefruit-driven finish. Modest in price, but the realthing.",Reserva,89,13.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Veramonte
96500,US,"Made from Beckstoffer's portion of To Kalon, this is exceptionally rich and decadent. Cabs don't get much riper. Blasts off with black currants, cassis, chocolate fudge and exotic spices. But the wine is soft and the alcohol is quite high, making it almost sweet. Would benefit from being drier and more structured.",Vice,89,150.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vice Versa

96504,Austria,"An off-dry Riesling, that preserves the evocative white perfumed fruits and rounds them out with some sweetness. It has an unmistakable almond and green plum flavor that goes with pear juice and a soft, mouthfilling close. Glass stopper.",Kollmütz Alte Reben,89,,Wachau,,,Riesling,Machherndl
96505,US,"Stiff, tannic, earthy and wrapped up tight. It's a big, bruiser of a wine, oaky, earthy and showing liquorous barrel flavors. Tasted three times over a four month period, it remains quite tight and hidden; the fruit is there but it's very difficult to get this wine to open up. In time, therating could significantly improve.",Water Witch Klipsun Vineyard Red Wine,89,45.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Mark Ryan
96506,France,"With its flavor that edges toward oxidative, this is the antithesis of easy, fruity white Bordeaux.

96507,US,"No question the flavors are right on, erupting in mouthfilling blackberries, cassis, cherries, cola and chocolate, with anise and cinnamon-dusted smoky oak.

96513,US,"Not many winemakers attempt a 100% varietal Petit Verdot; the grape is inky, tannic and unyielding, and the finish can be tongue-tyingly scrapey. But OS does well by it, putting together a steakhouse wine that promises to cut through the fattest, juiciest cut of beef you can toss at it. It's got the fruit too—blue plum, cassis, boysenberry—along with a dash of black pepper. The finish is all black coffee and bourbon.",Meek Vineyard,90,42.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Petit Verdot,OS Winery
96514,US,"Here's a polished young Merlot that's sophisticated enough to accompany a fine meal, yet doesn't selfishly demand all the attention to itself.

96519,Italy,"The Lamborghini family makes some of the best wines you'll find from Umbria and this juicy, rich and beautifully extracted blend of Cabernet, Sangiovese and Montepulciano is a prime example.

Michelle
96524,Chile,"Terrunyo is arguably Chile's best SB. This vintage gets going with a touch of green bean but also plenty of passion fruit and pink grapefruit. The palate is ripe, crystal-clear and tangy, and the passion fruit and citrus flavors really drive it home.

96526,Chile,"One of Chile's longest-held superpremiums is Albis, a joint-venture wine of the Antinori family of Italy and the Matte family from Chile. With this vintage, early mossy and leathery aromas yield to cassis and cherry flavors. There's a leathery, cheese-like element to the finish, which is offset by sweeter coconut and chocolate flavors.

96532,US,"Offered exclusively to mailing list customers, this 93-case wine is intensely built and loaded with dark, smoky, charred scents and flavors. Dense and compact, it seems built much like a Cabernet—on a base of sharp acids and dry tannins. Currently the layers that are so compact it's difficult to dissect them.

96537,US,"When California Riesling succeeds, it's because of wines like this, which hails from a well-farmed, cool-climate region.

96569,US,"A six-grape Rhône blend, this does not lose focus or intensity. It strikes the palate head-on with flavors of dried leaf, prune, cooked cherry, cinnamon and mocha. But despite the raisin/prune flavors, it does not seem overripe or in any way over the hill. Rather, these superripe flavors have somehow been tamed, the alcohol is just over 14%, and the wine leaves a sinuous, sensuous trail of flavor as it moves through the palate.",Rouge des Coteaux,90,18.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Rhône-style Red Blend,Olsen Estates
96570,Portugal,"The wine is soft, ripe, with a touch of maturity followed by good, tight wood tannins. The wine has a ripe character, quite full with hints of the wood aging as well as mature fruit.",Tawny,86,12.0,Port,,,Port,Poças
96571,Italy,"Red raspberry and ripe strawberry emerge from the nose of this well-priced Rosso di Montepulciano (with 20% Merlot). The wine is mature and slightly jammy but not in an overdone way. In fact, it will appeal to those who appreciate a slightly sweeter style.",,86,12.0,Tuscany,Rosso di Montepulciano,,Prugnolo Gentile,Canneto
96572,South Africa,"Floral aromas with a touch of citrus lead in this assertive white blend. The flavors‚Äîvanilla, fresh fruit, spice, are wrapped in a wave of smooth oak. Honey and spice add character. An elegant wine good for pairing with salad and poultry dishes.",Stonecross,86,11.0,Western Cape,,,Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay,Deetlefs
96573,Chile,"Sort of chunky and melony, with cantaloupe and baby powder on the nose. The palate is fairly weighty, but vital acidity gives it pulse, and the flavors of melon, pineapple and lime are pleasant. Softness on the finish suggests that it won't age very well; drink now.",Estate,86,14.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Errazuriz
96574,Chile,"Simple, clean aromas of pear fall off with airing, but the palate is solid, fleshy, properly acidic and tastes mostly of citrus. Spunky citrus is also what carries it to a good but pedestrian ending. A step up from regular.",Reserva Privada,86,13.0,Bío Bío Valley,,,Chardonnay,Agustinos
96575,US,"Tough, hard and dry, with thick tannins and a cut of acidity that obscure deep flavors of blackberries, black licorice and black pepper. This chewy wine could develop over the next 2–3 years, but right now, it's pretty unrelieved.",Reserve,86,24.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Frei Brothers
96576,US,"A solid Zinfandel to toss back with ribs, chicken, pork chops or a grilled steak. It's dry, full-bodied and tannic, with peppery flavors of blackberries and currants.",Jack London Vineyard,86,20.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kenwood
96577,Chile,"Fairly round and meaty on the nose, with vanilla, wood spice and herbal notes. The palate is lively and healthy, with good acidity pushing solid berry and plum flavors.

96579,South Africa,"This Cabernet offers candied plum, smoke, pepper and vanilla on the nose, and on the palate, a lively red berry, pepper and tobacco mélange. Moderate tannins and friendly fruit give it an approachable edge. Pair with beef or pasta.",Savanha,86,9.0,Western Cape,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Spier
96580,US,"Smells a bit underripe, with a whiff of fresh asparagus, and richness is missing in the mouth. The flavors are of citrus fruits, lees, oak and fresh herbs. Nicely dry and crisp, but rather lean.",Arcadia Vineyard,86,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars
96581,South Africa,"Gooseberry, pear and citrus on the nose start this perky Sauvignon Blanc.

96585,US,"The oak stands out on this young, fruity wine, giving a buttered toast and caramelized aroma and flavor to the underlying blackberry and black currant flavors.

96591,US,"There's a nice wine in here somewhere, but now it's cloaked under a heavy coating of oak and tannins, and the primary fruit cherry-berry flavors have a pie-filling sweetness. Give it at least 6–12 months in the cellar.",,86,30.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
96592,Portugal,"The wine has little sign of age, but still misses out on weight and definition. It has a soft toffee and sweet character, with soft tannins and a final raisin taste.",Late Bottled Vintage,86,39.0,Port,,,Port,Smith Woodhouse

96594,Chile,"Snappy, clean wine with hardly any obtrusive oak. Aromas and flavors of dry apple, melon and green fruits are clean, monotone in how they come across, and refreshing. In fact, structural spine and zest are the calling cards of this wine; it is pleasantly devoid of heavy tropical notes or oak.",Reserva,86,13.0,Limarí Valley,,,Chardonnay,Viña Tabalí

96600,US,"This is 100% varietal, this winery's most popular varietal offering, and nicely distinguished from its other reds. Recently bottled, it was still slightly shocked when tasted.

96603,South Africa,"With 16 months spent in 100% new French oak, this is a powerhouse of a wine. At first a bit overripe on the nose with notes of berry jam, kirsch, cigar box spice and a hint of smoke, the mouth shows similar concentrated dark fruit flavors but is lifted by supporting acidity, aggressive tannins and a tight structure. Dark chocolate-covered roasted espresso beans flood the long finish, and while the wine is good now, with five-plus years in the cellar it will be stellar.",Ronnie Melck A Tribute,91,60.0,Simonsberg-Stellenbosch,,,Shiraz,Muratie

96608,Australia,"Hazyblur's 2006 Cabernet offers textbook aromas of cedar and slightly herbal fruit, although the flavors lean toward red berries rather than dark cassis.

96617,Chile,"Three years running and this wine has been impressive since its debut in 2006. The nose is dark and sweet, maybe a touch pasty, but loaded with black fruit aromas.

96624,US,"This is a very rich, dry and concentrated Cabernet, but it's also very tannic. The blackberry, blueberry, cherry and currant flavors are wrapped into tight, hard tannins.

A mid-level wine in every way.",Reserva,85,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Casa de la Reina
96632,Spain,"Medicinal cherry and plum scents come with a grassy, minty persistence.

96807,US,"The 2005 Doyenne Aix is 50% Cabernet, 48% Syrah and 2% Mourvèdre. The increased percentage of Syrah and the extra dollop of Mourvèdre ramps this up to a stiffer, more substantial wine than the 2004. It's a Cabernet-driven complement to the DeLille D2, replete with muscle and nerve. Dark and chewy, the wine has picked up a little Rhône-like savage-ness from the Mourvèdre, especially in the aroma.

96808,US,"A dramatically dark, ripe wine that's nowhere near ready to drink now, due to the tannins. They're hard and strong and effectively shut the wine into astringent lockdown mode.

Drink now for maximum freshness and intensity.",Novas Limited Selection,89,17.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Emiliana
96816,Chile,"Pungent and teetering on the edge of herbaceousness. But then it draws back, settling on passion fruit, tropical breezes and lime. The wine has pulsing acidity and it dances on the palate. It's also sort of bracing and sharp, which some may find too razor-like for their palate.

96823,US,"This blend of Syrah and Petite Sirah is made in a drink-me-now style that emphasizes sheer deliciousness.

96829,New Zealand,"Fromm has nailed the texture of this Pinot, hitting just the right silky note. The aromas show an earthy, humus-like edge to the berry fruit and the touches of vanilla and maple syrup are maybe a touch too obvious. Cola and earth flavors mark the midpalate, while ripe berries come throughon the lingering finish, suggesting that this may even improve with 3–4 years in the cellar.",Clayvin Vineyard,89,72.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Fromm Winery
96830,Germany,"Muscat comes through loud and clear, offering up aromas redolent of oranges, citrus blossom and spice.

This would make a fine summertime picnic wine.",Neipperger Schlossberg Spätlese,89,34.0,Württemberg,,,Muskateller,Grafen Neipperg
96831,Austria,Hafner has been a pioneer of Austrian ice wine. Not every one in their considerable range of ice wines work. This one does. It has just that right piercing acidity to give a heart-stopping lift to the sweetness of the wine. The sweet pineapple and peach flavors add extra richness.,Essencia Eiswein,89,24.0,Burgenland,,,Chardonnay,Hafner
96832,Italy,"Murellaia is a modern and sweet-smelling wine with firm structure and intense aromas of sweetbread, candied fruit, vanilla, spice, black peppers and prunes. Try it with pork stuffed with stewed apricots.",Murellaia,89,50.0,Southern Italy,Sannio,,Aglianico,DeLucia Vineyards
96833,Austria,"It's obvious from the alcohol that the Merlot here was very ripe. But, happily, it doesn't taste that way. The balance of rich raisin and red plum flavors are well balanced by acidity. There is some smokiness from wood, the ripeness finishing freshly with a black cherry taste.",,89,26.0,Burgenland,,,Merlot,Hans Moser
96834,France,"Very rich, almost soupy, this is an enjoyable wine, not hugely structured and therefore not likely to age long. But in 2–3 years, drink this for its plumy fruits, its dried fruit richness and its light tannins.",,89,,Bordeaux,Pomerol,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château la Pointe
96835,France,"A classically structured wine, with its tannins and stalky black currant character prominent.

96837,Australia,"Shows classic Chard aromas of melon and peach, amply framed by toasted grain and cereal notes that add texture in the mouth.

96838,Chile,"Clean and fresh, and also varietally correct as it unloads full but accurate aromas of cucumber, passion fruit and lime. Casas del Bosque does very well with Sauvignon Blanc. This wine has all the citrus, tang and style you could ask for, but it shows good depth and complexity as well, which is what pushes it up to the next level. For $14, this wine delivers plenty.",Gran Reserva,89,14.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Casas del Bosque
96839,France,"Three elements, already in balance, contribute to the success of this wine. First, the rich fruit, juicy blackberry and mulberry, lifted by acidity. Second, the new wood, which spices the fruit but is already smoothing out the third element, the dark firm tannic layer.",,89,,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Haut-Beauséjour

96859,US,"Lots of acidity and dryness in this Chardonnay. It will strike some as austere and lean.

96861,US,"Just about as big, powerful and impressive as the variety gets. The wild berry, currant, smoked meat, tobacco, licorice and white pepper flavors explode in the mouth, contained by big, tight tannins. Right now there's a sharp cut of acidity that detracts, but the tartness should help the wine age.

96900,US,"A very fine effort, with classic cassis and black cherry in the fruit core, but also offering interesting details of bark, earth and herb.

Vineyard sources are first rate, mostly Wahluke Slope, and the wine has exceptional grip, depth and structure for Merlot at this price point.

97018,Spain,"Rather baked and heavy, with chunky black fruit and chocolate on the nose. First in line on the palate is raisin and prune, while in back of that there's vanilla, dill and brown sugar.

97021,South Africa,"This alluring Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon blend starts with aromas of black cherry, violets and black currant, leading into waves of black fruit and spice.

97023,Spain,"A fuller, more minty and deep Garnacha than Hughes' Lot 129. This has standup, standout aromas followed by deep berry fruit flavors.

97025,Spain,"A touch horsey at first, but with time it settles on saddle leather and earthy fruit. The palate is chunky and beefy, with some funk, chocolate and herbal black fruit.

97038,US,"Just released, young and tight, this widely available (25,000 case) Oregon Pinot shows the strengths of the 2008 vintage.

97046,France,"From 2009, Labégorce-Zédé will no longer exist, being amalgamated with Château Labégorce-Margaux. So this 2007 is one of the last vintages.

It is definitely for aging.",,90,,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Labegorce Zédé

97057,US,"The very tannic '05 reserve is a blend of Petit Verdot, Cab Sauvignon, Merlot and Cab Franc. It's fleshy and rich in blackberry, cassis and tobacco flavors, with lots of new toasty oak, and there's something meaty, like ground hamburger with a splash of tamari.

It refuses to be a fruit bomb, but offers a wealth of sumptuous blackberry and cherry liqueur flavors that pull back at the last moment under a blanket of youthful tannins.

97064,US,"This is the winery's best Chardonnay blend. It comes mainly from Sanford & Benedict Vineyard, and shows the fine structure associated with the appellation.

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Longoria
97065,US,"Despite the pale color, this is a powerful wine. It comes from this famous vineyard that pioneered the Santa Rita Hills.

97066,Australia,"Already approachable, Mitolo's 2006 G.A.M. should nevertheless age 10–15 years.

97083,Italy,"There's a fun, fruity element to this luminous white wine that makes it immediately distinguishable in a crowd. The aromas include banana and passion fruit but there are also pretty background notes of jasmine and acacia.

97085,US,"The first edition (2004) of the Stella Mae Syrah was a big, jammy banger, its lush fruit buttressed with streaks of citrus.

97096,Australia,"Espresso, blackberry and black olive flavors all come together on the palate of this medium- to full-bodied Shiraz. Hints of leather, plum, menthol and spice add complexity to the aromas, while only a touch of warmth on the finish from its 15% alcohol keeps this from an excellent rating. Drink now.",The Shearer,89,18.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Longwood
97097,Chile,"Nice fruit and some juicy bounce are the hallmarks of this pleasant, stylish Pinot Noir. The nose has bright plum and raspberry, but the aromas and flavors are controlled and wholesome, not funky or stretched thin. With a pinch of oak, this wine more than makes the grade.",Tobiano,89,20.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Pinot Noir,Kingston Family
97098,Australia,"Seemingly fully mature, this wine features lots of savory, meaty notes to go along with dried fruit aromas, then adds brighter, tart berry flavors on the palate. Vanilla, tobacco and crisp acids seem to be taking control of the finish, so drink up before the fruit fades.",Frux Frugis,89,60.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Ulithorne
97099,Australia,"Sure, it's an oaky Chardonnay, but it's an uncommonly well-executed version at a reasonable price. Scents of toast, cinnamon and citrus custard give way to flavors of oranges, stone fruit and toasted grain. It's richly textured and lush in the mouth, showing just a hint of warmth on the finish.",,89,17.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Chardonnay,Wakefield Estate
97100,US,"This is a spicy and fragrant red wine, the 63% Grenache dominating the fruit, and the 37% Syrah filling in the back with peppery tannins. At first the flavors are tight and compressed, a mix of blackberry, cherry, plum and more, along with streaks of espresso. As the acids wind their way down the throat, they take on strong citrus flavors of lemon, pineapple and orange peel.",Una Notte,89,30.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Red Blend,:Nota Bene
97101,New Zealand,"There's a slightly smoky, fume character to this wine's otherwise ripe aromas of stone fruit, melon and fig, giving an extra layer of complexity. And despite the ripe aromas, this wine is crisp and grassy on the palate, delivering a long finish with finely delineated flavors.",,89,14.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Sherwood Estate
97102,US,"Defines a certain style of Sauvignon Blanc, namely the bone-dry, ultracrisp version whose firm structure frames a bright, zesty taste. The flavors are of lemons, limes, grapefruits, figs, white pepper and minerals, with a rich grassiness. This Loire-like wine is so versatile, you can have it with almost anything.",,89,9.0,California,California,California Other,Sauvignon Blanc,Redwood Creek
97103,US,"Saxum has taken a considerable price increase with the '05, which is a blend of Syrah and Grenache, with a touch of Mourvedre. It's a soft, rich wine, powerful in red and black currant, cherry liqueur, chocolate and licorice   flavors. It's also fairly tough in tannins, although acidity is low. That gives it a slight rusticity. Drink now.",Broken Stones,89,45.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,Saxum
97104,US,"Tremendously concentrated, a powerful wine that erupts with blackberry, currant, cocoa, licorice, cola, caramel and vanilla flavors. For all the size, the hard tannins makes it badly in need of time in the cellar. Won't even begin to soften for a couple of years, even though most people will pop the cork way too early.",,89,75.0,California,Mount Veeder,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rubissow
97105,US,"The estate-grown fruit has been deftly handled, retaining its blackberry, blueberry and black cherry core, with a layer of smoky tannins underneath. This is blended with 15% Merlot, which seems to broaden the midpalate and add a hint of red fruits as well. The finish is thick and substantial, and the wine keeps its focus all the way through.",,89,25.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Franc,Canoe Ridge

97107,Italy,"This sophisticated Chardonnay offers pretty fullness, opulence and gorgeous luminosity in the glass. Its fruit-forward aromas include ripe peach, almond, butter and pineapple but the wine also has an interesting edge that recalls mint or peppermint. The mouthfeel is less intense than the nose but the wine ends on a fruity, fresh mark nonetheless.",Il Tornese,89,27.0,Central Italy,Emilia-Romagna,,Chardonnay,Drei Donà Tenuta La Palazza
97108,New Zealand,"A solid effort from the world's first carbon-neutral winery, this starts off a little tarry and rubbery, but that blows off to reveal a dense, rich wine filled with black cherry fruit and ending on roast coffee-bean notes.",,89,23.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Grove Mill

97110,Chile,"Aromatics of dill and vanilla are straight from the Old World, but otherwise this is modern and flush. Aromas of cedar and wood resin are also present in front of a tannic, roasted palate that features soft berry fruit, cola and medicinal flavors. Ripe, big and sweet; starts like Rioja and finishes like classic Chilean Cabernet; includes 17% Merlot and Carmenère.",DON,90,75.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Red Blend,Santa Helena

97112,Spain,"A loud, fiery nose indicates that this wine has a lot in store. Aromas of brick dust, earth, tobacco and red pepper flake set up a choppy, tannic, lively palate with a full dosage of cherry, plum, spice and toast flavors. Roasted on the finish but still fresh.

97114,France,"A wine that seems lean, even angular at first. It does, though, have a good depth of black plum skin fruits. The finish continues the tough theme, showing that it needs several years of softening up.",,90,,Bordeaux,Pauillac,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Croizet-Bages

97117,US,"Rich and dry, with a mélange of raspberry and cherry pie, cola, red licorice, bacon and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into firm but silky tannins. Acidity is quite nice, giving the richness a clean scour. Might develop subtleties over the years, but seems best now and through 2013.",Rancho Santa Rosa Vineyard,90,44.0,California,Sta.

97119,US,"The Mendocino Ridge appellation, which is defined by elevation boundaries, borders Anderson Valley. This Pinot shows cool-climate crispness but also fog-free, ripe flavors of raspberries and cherries that are deep and impressive.

97122,US,"Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this wine is exuberantly rich and sweet in ripe blackberry, black cherry and chocolate fruit.

97124,Italy,"Piccini's Brunello Villa al Cortile is an interesting wine with its own unique personality.

97128,US,"A good, dry, fleshy wine. Not showing well now in its youth, because it's tannic and unintegrated, with flavors flying all over the place. But there's a solid core of blackberry and black cherry sour candy, a good sign.

97129,US,"Celebrity chef Florence, in partnership with Rob Mondavi, from Folio Fine Wine Partners, has crafted this delicious, zesty Sauvignon Blanc. It's so rich in kiwi, lime, tangerine, wildflower, vanilla and mineral flavors, it's practically a food group in itself, but bright acidity grounds and balances it.

97132,New Zealand,"The Awatere is a Marlborough subregion whose wines are often a touch more edgy than those grown in the main valley. After nine months in French oak, this wine's black cherry fruit is marked by touches of vanilla and toast, a slightly creamy mouthfeel and a crisp, refreshing finish.

97141,Chile,"Very nicely done for a new brand that we haven't seen before. This is Chilean SB in fine form. It's a mix of green and ripe fruits both on the nose and palate.

97142,South Africa,"This is a stylish Pinotage and may turn skeptics into believers on this eccentric variety. Waves of ripe red fruit, cedar, vanilla and spice are followed by dense layers of red berry fruit, warming spices and a touch of smoke.

97144,Germany,"For a Pauly Bergweiler wine, this is atypically minerally, as its wines have tended toward the lush, fruity side of the spectrum over recent years.

97145,US,"This is a dark, huge Pinot Noir, so rich and opulently fruity that it might almost be a Grenache. It has a thick, soft mouthfeel, and is explosive in cherry jam, red licorice and mocha flavors that are utterly delicious. However, there's a certain direct appeal that lacks complexity and nuance.

97156,Chile,"Quite pleasant and true to the variety. Punchbowl aromas of melon and passion fruit are friendly and not the least bit harsh.

97157,New Zealand,"On the herbal-vegetal side of the Sauvignon Blanc spectrum, but manages to balance those elements with red pepper and nectarine flavors in a plump, easygoing style. Served with a cold vegetable terrine, this would be very stylish. Drink now.",,88,18.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Blocks
97158,Chile,"A little bulky and maybe just beginning to fade. This is a rounder and chunkier specimen than the 2008 Cipreses SB, and it shows softness at its core and hints of green bean and bell pepper.

97174,Chile,"No getting around the fact that this wine is raisiny but not that ripe in the middle. The nose suggests deep fruit, with blackberry, prune and other black fruit aromas.

97175,Chile,"Dusty apple, pear and other dry-fruit aromas give this clean wine a good but basic starting point.

97179,Chile,"Quite the floral wine, with blueberry and violet aromas that distinguish it from others. But the palate is sharp and choppy, with high acidity that lends sharpness to the black cherry and raspberry flavors. Stirs interest because it breaks the mold of heavy, black fruit-dominated Syrahs.

97354,France,"You can tell this is going to be sweet by its gold color.

97366,France,"From volcanic soil, this ripe, but tight style of Muscadet is one that needs aging. Even after two years, the acidity has not completely molded round the fresh grapefruit flavors. It's lively, very crisp, demanding food.",Expression de Orthogneiss,91,24.0,Loire Valley,Muscadet Sèvre et Maine,,Melon,Domaine de l'Ecu
97367,US,"Iron Horse's estate Chard is a remarkably consistent wine. Never overoaked, superripe or heavy, it always has an elegant minerality. The '06, from a coolish vintage, is flavored with green apples, Meyer lemons and Bosc pears.",Estate,91,28.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse

97369,US,"In a sea of mediocre Merlots, Longboard's '06 stands out. It's not only deliciously ripe and generous in blackberries, cherries, currants, licorice, cola and mocha flavors, but the structure of fine acidity and smooth, elegant tannins makes it delectable.",DaKine Vineyard,91,24.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Longboard
97370,France,"Lapierre bottled two versions of this wine, one using no sulfur, one using some sulfur. It makes a fascinating contrast, but this version without sulfur is inevitably the better, not losing one iota of the ripe fruit, the rich cherries and immediately attractive bonbon and candy flavors.",,91,22.0,Beaujolais,Morgon,,Gamay,Marcel Lapierre
97371,Chile,"Balsam, lush prune and all sorts of earthy, interesting aromas set this rich, ripe Carmenère off on a wild ride. Chocolate greets you at the front door, with deep plum and berry waiting behind. It's saturated and superripe but it doesn't lose step or steam. Excellent in the ultraripe, modern style.",Orzada,91,20.0,Maule Valley,,,Carmenère,Odfjell
97372,US,"There's something tight and minerally and acidic about this Chardonnay that will appeal to connoisseurs of austere wines. Even though the oak is nearly one-half new, the wine has a lean, lemony taste, with nuances of crème brûlée and roasted hazelnuts. Defines food-friendly elegance, and could develop bottle complexity over the next 5 years.",,91,35.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Merryvale
97373,South Africa,"An alluring nose of violets, berries and a touch of spice begins this stylish wine from Waterford. On the palate, flowers, spice and minerals unfold and mingle with elegance. The tannins are pronounced but refined. The wine will age and offer more as time passes, but it's a gorgeous sip today.",The Jem,91,100.0,Stellenbosch,,,Red Blend,Waterford
97374,Italy,"What sets this beautiful Riserva apart from the crowd is its delicate, ethereal and extremely harmonious nature. In the truest spirit of Chianti Classico, it offers a bright, fresh and crisp experience accented by aromas of cherry, red apple skin and subdued almond. That apple note adds buoyancy and dimension and affirms its traditional approach.",Riserva,91,,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Felsina
97375,Italy,"There's a very attractive fullness and roundness to this wine that wins over your senses the moment you lift the glass to your nose. The wine delivers aromas of black cherry, Asian spice, root beer, vanilla and sweet maple syrup that are distinct and pristine. It's modern and velvety in the mouth with tight structure and great length.",Riserva Novecento,91,50.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Dievole
97376,US,"Richly oaked, fantastically ripe in long hangtime fruit, this Chard has exotic flavors of golden mangoes, nectarines, passionfruit, pineapple jam and kiwis.

97379,US,"With its black pepper aromas and dry, hard tannins that make the mouth pucker, this is an atypical Rutherford Cabernet. But it's a very good, even a noble one. As tough as it is, it possesses a rich core of black currant that lasts through a long finish. Unusual and distinctive, it should hold its own for a decade.",,91,40.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Riboli

97386,Italy,"Donatella Cinelli Colombini regularly brings us very soft, rich and velvety expressions of Brunello. This vintage, however, is more austere, reserved and seems to need more time to open and breathe in the glass. As it does, it reveals layers of cherry, almond paste, smoke, vanilla and powdered chocolate.",,90,70.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Donatella Cinelli Colombini
97387,New Zealand,"Always dark in color and flavor profile, Craggy Range stays true to those traits with an excellent 2008 from its own Te Muna Road Vineyard.

97388,Chile,"A deep, dark Syrah with cola, spice, pepper, cedar and olive notes to go with more familiar blackberry and mocha.

Has good flow and feel, and overall it strikes the right chords.",Single Vineyard,90,21.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Syrah,Errazuriz
97389,US,"This big, powerfully fruity Pinot Noir screams coastal California all the way through. The raspberry, cherry and spice flavors, brightened with acidity, taste of long, warm days and cool nights. It's a good wine, but too young, and would have benefited had the winery held it back a year or so before release. Better into 2012.",Balo Vineyard,90,40.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Drew
97390,Italy,"Altesino's Brunello is characterized by fine tannins, good acidity and aromas of white cherry, forest floor and bramble. The wine seems less intense than past vintages and there's a slightly browning edge to its color.",,90,75.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Altesino
97391,US,"Dry, dustily tannic and somewhat closed down, this Cabernet clearly wants some time in the cellar. It has rich, juicy blackberry and cherry flavors, but the tannins and acidity close in fast, locking them down and making the wine astringent and tart. Give it a few years, or decant if you're opening it now.",,90,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frank Family
97392,US,"Showing the intensely concentrated flavors of low-yielding old vines, this Zin is dense and rich in wild blackberry, briary blueberry, black pepper and cola flavors, with curious tastes that must come from the minerals in the earth. It's a bit rustic, but who cares? Break out your best grilled meats and poultry and savor this wine, if you can find it. Production was only 320 cases.",Old Vine 1908 Brignoli Vineyard,90,28.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,J. Rickards
97393,US,"A stellar bottle from this newish Lake County-based producer, a Demeter Biodynamic and CCOF Organic certified producer with mountain-top vineyard land in the prime Red Hills sub-AVA. The Cab grows at 1,800-2,200 feet elevation in rocky, red soil, yielding a classically rich, red wine nuanced with subtle, soft tannins and enviable structure, giving it room to grow another 5–7 years.",,90,65.0,California,Red Hills Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hawk and Horse Vineyards
97394,Italy,"The evident oak element in this hearty Brunello needs time to integrate because the spice, toasted nut, clove and crushed peppercorn aromas are still strong. But the mouthfeel is soft, plush and shows great potential.",Franci,90,65.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Tassi
97395,New Zealand,"A pleasant surprise from this relatively young producer.

97399,Italy,"This is a simply wonderful Chianti Classico Riserva that would pair with all sorts of Italian and American foods thanks to the clarity of its berry fruit aromas and its tasty, spicy finish.

97403,US,"A beautiful Zinfandel, lusty and smooth, that takes the variety's rustic, wild berry, tobacco, anise, herb and pepper flavors and makes them as elegant as Zinfandel gets.

97406,Italy,"Carob, sour cherry, bramble, leafy greens and exotic spice are some of the eclectic aromatic components of this wine's bright bouquet.

97407,US,"Drew used to release this bottling some 16 or 17 months after the vintage. This wine has been rushed to market at barely more than a year of age. As a result, this young wine shows the ripe flavors and structural integrity of earlier vintages, such as the wonderful 2007, but it's rude in jam and acids.

97408,Israel,"Like the Petit Castel, this wine needs some time to truly open up and express itself, so be sure to give it time to breathe before serving.

97411,Germany,"The aromas are of dark honey—there's almost a roasted quality to them that verges on caramel. The flavors follow in a similar vein, suggesting roasted pineapple and caramelized peach, while the mouthfeel is pleasantly rich and filling.",Abtsberg Auslese,88,49.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Maximin Grünhäuser
97412,South Africa,"Spicy, earthy, assertive…this wine has character. Toast, fruit, minerality and citrus on the palate gives it a fun feel, but the wine is seriously good. Excellent for seafood or more complex Asian cuisine.",Five Soldiers,88,38.0,Stellenbosch,,,Chardonnay,Rustenberg
97413,Chile,"Younger is better when it comes to 1865 SB. Tasted alongside the older 2007, this wine is brighter, more focused, more balanced and ultimately more fun and flavorful to drink. It is direct and clean, with passion fruit, green pepper and freshness on the nose. The palate shows green fruit,bell pepper and grapefruit, and the finish is intense.",1865 Single Vineyard,88,17.0,Leyda Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,San Pedro
97414,US,"There is a pleasing creaminess to the mouthfeel, yet the wine retains well-defined green apple and citrus fruit flavors.

97415,Chile,"Pleasant and melony on the nose, without the sharp, piercing aromas that sometimes push Chilean SB over the edge.

97416,Chile,"Light, lucid and exactly what we're looking for from Chile. This organic wine has pure varietal aromas of nettles, tarragon and citrus, which are followed by flavors of green fruits, scallion and pepper. It's super zesty and spritzy, with a cleansing finish.

97418,France,"This intriguing wine is dominated by the 60% of normally rare Petit Verdot.

97421,France,"In recent years, the Gardiniers of Phélan-Ségur seem to have become preoccupied with wood, generally too much. It's the same in 2006, and it is a shame, because everything else about this wine is balanced—the fruit is ripe and sweet and there is some freshness from a cranberry note. It just needs the wood to become less dominant.",,88,,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Phélan-Ségur
97422,France,"Made by the same team as Château Pichon Lalande, this is a tensely textured, austere wine, still young when tasted, but showing good potential to develop into elegance, with black fruit and dense tannins blending easily into fresh acidity. Age for 4–5 years.",,88,,Bordeaux,Haut-Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Bernadotte

97426,US,"Co-fermented with Viognier from the same vineyard, this is a lovely counterpoint to the big, bruising Barrister Bacchus Vineyard Syrah.

97428,US,"Fermented and aged in Burgundian oak, this is intended to evoke a traditional Meursault style. It isn't far from the mark; soft and oaky, it's a bit like biting into a ripe banana squished between two graham crackers. Other tropical fruit flavors are in evidence: mango, pineapple and papaya.

97431,Germany,"Of the various Huber Pinot Noirs, this is the one most in need of 2–3 years of cellaring. Some pungent cabbage and cedar aromas should be better integrated by then, and the firm tannins now evident on the finish should also be at least partially resolved. Right now, there's a hint of silkiness and some nice plum and sous-bois notes that should only improve over the short term.",Hecklinger Schlossberg R Trocken,88,104.0,Baden,,,Spätburgunder,Huber
97432,South Africa,"A rich, full-bodied nose of tropical fruit leads on this complex Sauvignon Blanc from Jardin.

An elegant wine that's integrated and ageable.",,88,14.0,Stellenbosch,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Jardin
97433,New Zealand,"Shows the mushroomy, earthier side of New Zealand Pinot Noir, but does it very well, backing up those flavors with plenty of weight and intensity as well as cola-tinged dark fruit.

97434,New Zealand,"Sweaty and pungent, loaded with overtones of crushed tomato leaf, this is an assertively herbal wine that requires careful food pairing, or a healthy preference for that style.

97438,South Africa,"Fresh, fruity and charming, this rosé offers full-bodied flavors of strawberry and spice that are balanced and complex.

97442,Chile,"Tight at first, with aromas of olive, brick dust, cured cheese and dark fruit. The palate on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère (15%) is narrow but healthy.

97445,Italy,"This vintage of Tenuta di Trinoro's renowned super Tuscan (mostly Merlot with some Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Canernet Sauvignon) is a tad too ripe and mature to score higher. Bold notes of strawberry and blackberry preserves rob the wine of some of its inherent elegance and add a chewy, sticky element to its mouthfeel.

97450,New Zealand,"This seems to take a page out of Australia's Clare Valley Riesling style book, offering floral notes, green apple and citrus aromas and a reasonably dry, muscular style. Lime sherbet flavors dominate, finishing crisp and tart.",,89,18.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Saint Clair
97451,US,"A fair amount of this is old vine (1972) Cabernet from Bacchus and Dionysus; it's 100% pure varietal.

97453,US,"Here is another fine effort from Columbia Crest that captures some spice and keeps the fruit bright and fresh.

97457,New Zealand,"A dark and brooding style that's atypical for Marlborough Pinot Noir, with earthy aromas hinting at mushroom give way to modest cherry fruit on the palate.

97458,Italy,"Vibrant cherry and blueberry fruit is backed by sweet spice and thick extraction.

97461,Australia,"The Reserve wines from Jacob's Creek continue to offer excellent value, and with 90,000 cases imported, this should be easy to find.

97463,US,"Adelaida is assembling a good track record with this wine. It's from the cooler western portion of the appellation, so that crisp acidity provides a fine framework for the slightly sweet tropical fruit, wildflower and spice flavors.

97464,US,"The Métier White is a sleek, assertive and racy white wine that does not fall into the flavor ranks of most Washington Viognier, though that is 90% of the blend. The rest is Roussanne, which adds notes of Meyer lemon. The wine is clean and crisp, well-defined with flavors of citrus and green herb. It is built upon vibrant acids rather than barrel flavors, and in a blind tasting it might pass for a somewhat salty (rather than peppery) Grüner Veltliner.",Métier White,89,32.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,White Blend,Doyenne

97475,Chile,"Concentrated and sweet, with medicinal aromas, a lot of color and burnt characteristics. The palate is big and acidic, with jumpy plum, berry and candied flavors.

97509,US,"Dark and juicy, the tight flavors are a mix of black cherry and cassis, with a tart mouthfeel and smooth finishing tannins. Though it sees 60% new oak, the wine spends relatively little time in those barrels, and doesn't show as much oak influence as you'd suspect. A firm finish from Red Mountain tannins brings in dark chocolate, smoke and coffee grounds.",,90,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Tamarack Cellars

97514,US,"Pleasingly soft in the mouth, this blend of Cabernet, Merlot, Malbec and Syrah is supple with a mellow fruitiness. Cassis and cherries dominate the midpalate, with new oak barrels filling in the back with toast and butterscotch and vanilla.

97529,US,"A good, lusty wine, although it's too young now, offering a big mouthful of tannins, acidity and immature fruit.

Edgy and citric overall, but at the same time you won't get shorted.",Visión,88,15.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Cono Sur
97722,Austria,"Taking its cue from the cool 2007 vintage, this Smaragd is very pure in its fine white fruit flavors, bone-dry with a definite fruit skin texture. It is crisp as much as rich, leaving fresh acidity to finish. Screwcap.",Steinwand Smaragd,88,28.0,Wachau,,,Grüner Veltliner,Machherndl
97723,Germany,"For only 11% alcohol and virtually no residual sugar, this is surprisingly weighty, with ample richness and depth. There's a strong petrochemical side to the aroma, but the flavors are fruitier, evoking baked apple and dried spices. Turns citrusy on the finish.",Abtsberg Superior,88,49.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Maximin Grünhäuser
97724,US,"Barrel fermented in new French oak, then pulled out and put into neutral oak. So the acids are softened, the wine gains some flesh, and there are nuances of toast and butter without overwhelming the fruit.",Angel,88,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Guardian Cellars
97725,US,"Bring on the cheeseburgers! This is an outrageously delicious, easy-drinking Zin that will fall in love with charbroiled beef and melted cheese. It's not a terribly complicated wine, but perfect for immediate enjoyment with comfort foods.",Rancho Bello Vineyard,88,26.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ottimino Vineyards
97726,Germany,"Intensely mineral on the nose, followed up on the palate by flavors of crushed vitamin tablets, wet stone and brine. Despite some residual sweetness, the overall impression is of salty, mineral dryness coupled with tart, citrusy flavors on the finish.",Medium-Dry,88,22.0,Nahe,,,Riesling,Schäfer-Fröhlich
97727,Germany,"Even tasted blind, this wine comes across as a bit warm. The 15% alcohol imparts a thick, rich consistency in the mouth, while the flavors stay true to the site, showing notes of ripe peaches, citrus and hints of home heating oil. It's certainly impressive, but the alcohol shows through a bit on the finish, suggesting near-term consumption.",Grünlack Spätlese Trocken,88,50.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Schloss Johannisberger
97728,Australia,"Shaw and Smith's Sauvignon Blanc has become emblematic of the Adelaide Hills style, combining tropical fruit with a grassy streak, all framed by zippy citrus flavors. This would work equally as an apéritif or with various seafood dishes.",,88,25.0,South Australia,Adelaide Hills,,Sauvignon Blanc,Shaw and Smith
97729,Italy,"Speri's Ripasso has an added layer of spice, vanilla and other oak-generated aromas that distinguish it. There's a juicy core of fruit there too: black cherry, plums and white raisin. Drink this wine with meat-filled ravioli or wild mushrooms.",,88,28.0,Veneto,Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso,,Red Blend,Speri
97730,US,"Ripe and peppery, this exuberant Zin was made to wash down beef fajitas and tacos or a cheddar cheese-covered hamburger. It floods the mouth with blackberry, cherry and currant flavors, wrapped into thick, sturdy tannins.",SHR Field Blend,88,29.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Terra d'Oro
97731,Chile,"Common apple, melon and other green, zesty aromas work the nose, which is slightly more reserved than outright pungent. The palate is flashy but a touch lean, with blazing acidity pushing tart, crisp, focused flavors of green apple and citrus. Not out of the ordinary, but quite well made and cleansing.",T.H.,88,22.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Undurraga
97732,US,"A strong scent and flavor of vitamin pill mixes with tight red fruit, stone, licorice and earth in this Rhône blend that includes small amounts of Grenache and Mourvèdre. Give this wine time to breathe and let the fruit come forward before you drink it.",,88,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Zerba Cellars
97733,US,"Crisp acidity and firm tannins give a framework to this massively fruity, rather extracted blend of all five Bordeaux varieties. Without that structure, it would be all jammy cherries and currants. Fine now with a grilled steak, and for the next several years.",Red Wine,88,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Hendry
97734,Italy,"Riserva Cappellaccio is a pure expression of Aglianico that has embraced the scorching heat of the 2003 vintage to deliver warm tones of jammy fruit, tar, asphalt, resin and natural spice.

97735,US,"Enormously sweet, with sugared blackberry, currant and dark chocolate flavors that are frankly delicious. Nice as a nighttime winter apéritif, with some chocolaty confection and a roaring fire.",Imogene's Vineyard Tomas,88,52.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Port,Prager
97736,US,"The tannins are holding this Bordeaux blend back now, making it hard and astringent. Even so, the fruit is so powerful, it breaks through to impress. The black currant, cassis and plum jam flavors are complexed with notes of teriyaki beef jerky, cocoa and Asian spices. Could improve considerably in the bottle.",Dancing Bear Ranch,88,106.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,Cakebread
97737,US,"This is drinking very well; there's a little Merlot and Petit Verdot too in the blend. It's plummy and open, a little loose-knit in the core but soft and approachable. Wrapped into the tart fruit are streaks of licorice and tar, with light loamy tannins.",,88,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chatter Creek
97738,Italy,"Here is a wonderful example of Sauvignon Blanc from Northern Italy at its most aromatic and fragrant. The wine boasts pristine notes of sage leaf, kiwi and honeydew melon. The mouthfeel is firm, tonic and compact.",Prail,88,21.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Sauvignon,Colterenzio
97739,France,"This juicy, fruit forward Grenache offers flavors of red plum, blueberries and licorice supported by notes of rosemary and roses in the background.

97740,Australia,"An interesting blend (70% Cab, 25% Tempranillo, 5% Zin), Tryst represents Nepenthe's continuing efforts to break out of sterotypical Aussie wines.

97742,France,"An attractively balanced wine, full of ripe, warm fruit, but still keeping the acidity as a counterweight to the rich tropical and white fruit flavors. The wood shows, but the fruit powers through to give richness and some freshness.",La Chatenière Premier Cru,89,38.0,Burgundy,Saint-Aubin,,Chardonnay,Roux Père et Fils
97743,Hungary,"This Hungarian dessert wine has a light, elegant nose of citrus and flowers and on the palate offers deep, delicious flavors of honey, orange and citrus. Luxurious and unctuous, it feels slightly heavy on the tongue and could use a touch more acidity. Overall, though, it's a very compelling wine with great character.",Aszú 6 Puttonyos,89,70.0,Tokaj,,,Tokaji,Patricius

97748,US,"This is made in a very approachable style, with chocolate and spice flavors ahead of light red fruits. In the blend are Syrah, Merlot, Sangiovese and Cabernet Franc, which makes this more of a proprietary red than a true Cabernet Sauvignon. Whatever you call it, the wine's soft palate and highlights of cracker, mocha and sandalwood make it easy to enjoy.",,88,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau Ste.

97749,New Zealand,"Like all the Fromm wines, this is a densely structured effort. It blends black cherries and spice with hints of pepper, cedar and bracken, finishing long. Probably best from 2010.",Clayvin Vineyard,88,64.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Fromm Winery
97750,US,"Though not indicated, this is all Pepper Bridge fruit. It's got a nice mix of berries, pepper and toasty chocolate. There's a hint of flower in the nose, and the palate is lifted, though not volatile.

97751,US,"This is 80% Merlot, and could legally be labeled as such. It's got a pretty nose, scented with rose petals and cherries. Flavors are quite tightly wound and tasting a bit sharp. The liquorous bourbon barrel flavors dominate, centered around ripe cherry fruit.",Klipsun Vineyard Red Wine,88,40.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Cadence
97752,US,"Petite Sirah's heavy, tannic, acidic personality lends itself to making a Port-style wine, and this is a good one. With 9% residual sugar, it's quite sweet, and the blackberry and chocolate fudge flavors are easy to drink.",Petite Sirah,88,18.0,California,Clarksburg,Central Valley,Port,Bogle
97753,Italy,"This is a luscious and delicious Sauvignon with pungent tones of passion fruit, fresh mango, exotic fruit, sage, tomato leaf and lingering lime.

97754,Italy,"Lungarotti comes through with a Sagrantino di Montefalco that has a cheerful nose of plump blueberry, spice box, prune and Graham crackers.

97755,France,"Heavy and glowering, this wine is powered with weight. The fruit is an afterthought, the white currants, green plums and acidity creeping in after all the density of structure has softened. Wood to finish.",,88,129.0,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne,,Chardonnay,Labouré-Roi
97756,US,"The grapes sure got ripe even in this cool, balanced vintage, so that the wine is jammy in cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors. It's delicious and crisply elegant, with a silky texture, but a little direct and forward. Probably at its best now.",Sangiacomo Vineyards,88,48.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
97757,Australia,"Features some superb elements that come off as a bit disjointed—perhaps it just needs some time? High-toned cherry fruit picks up some herbal notes and peppery cinnamon flavors, then finishes crisp, with hints of orange pekoe tea.",Clarendon,88,30.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Oliverhill
97758,New Zealand,"This pioneering Otago winery has turned out a medium-bodied, sturdily built Riesling loaded with notes of baked apples and spice.

97759,US,"Here's a fine young Sauvignon Blanc that shows plenty of crisp sophistication.

97762,Italy,"Here's a Cab Sauvignon-Cab Franc blend that is redolent of mature fruit, strawberry and blueberry preserves.

It tastes slight sweet and chewy in the mouth and ends with tart tannins.",Fidenzio,88,,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Podere San Luigi

97767,Chile,"Smoky, smooth and deep, with a notch or two of complexity on its belt.

Adequate length and chewy, manageable tannins make the finish a solid final chapter.",20 Barrels,88,25.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Merlot,Cono Sur
97768,US,"Made to be opened now, this polished young Syrah is bright in blackberry, black currant, licorice and chocolate flavors, and is very dry. Oak provides a touch of smokiness.

97769,US,"Fans of superfruity, oaky, big Chards will love this one. The grapes came from outside the true Santa Lucia Highlands AVA, but the wine shows similar power, with incredibly ripe, jammy yellow tropical fruit flavors accompanied by rich acidity. There's also a lot of new, smoky oak.",HMR Estate Santa Lucia Highland Range,88,35.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Adelaida
97770,Portugal,"A wine that tastes of hot, raisiny fruit. It has acidity, but seems to have an edge that comes from dark, bitter tannins. The chocolate flavors are bitter also, firmed by edgy tannins.",Late Bottled Vintage,84,,Port,,,Port,Quinta do Estanho
97771,US,"Ripe and rich, but rather heavy and softly sweet, this wine lacks the vibrancy and elegance you want in a fine Pinot Noir, especially at this price. It's a decent everyday wine, with cola, rhubarb pie and cherry flavors.",Swan Selection,84,42.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Buena Vista

97776,US,"You have to look no further than this wine to appreciate how much less the 2006 vintage was than the 2005 (or 2007, for that matter).

Tastes sour every time you revisit it.",Reserve Barrel Select,84,12.0,Cachapoal Valley,,,Syrah,Santa Ema
97779,US,"This started out as a perfectly nice Chardonnay. It was dry, crisp and balanced, with a minerality under the pineapple and peach flavors. Then the winemaker decided to plaster it with oak, and it tastes like it went through the malolactic fermentation. The quality was lessened.",,84,12.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Liberty School

97781,US,"This dry and full-bodied wine is a little rugged and heavy in texture, with an astringently tannic finish. But it has enough cherry, berry and oak flavors to make it a pretty good buy at this price.",,84,13.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Leaping Lizard
97782,Chile,"A very dry, crisp white wine with a neutral color and equally neutral aromas and flavors. It's lean, green apple-driven and fresh, but not what you'd call loaded with personality. Cleanses the palate and washes things down, but does so quietly.",Vinas Viejas,84,12.0,Elqui Valley,,,Pedro Ximénez,Elki
97783,US,"Tastes too over-oaked for what you get. There are modest cherry-berry flavors, but the wine is dominated by smoky char, caramel and butterscotch. Ready now.",,84,30.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Emmolo

97790,US,"The Naked (organically grown) series from Snoqualmie continues to expand, now with this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. It feels soft and manipulated in the mouth; there is a hole in it.

97797,Chile,"Popcorn, toast and spiced pear aromas are forced and elementary, while the palate is honeyed and resiny and tastes like apple-cinnamon herbal tea and OJ. Has a faux oaky dominance and will lose vitality quickly.",Block Selection Reserve,83,11.0,Limarí Valley,,,Chardonnay,La Playa
97798,Chile,"Robust and stemmy, with soupy, herbal aromas that lean toward mint and tomato. The acidity is high, and thus the raspberry/red cherry flavors are lean and tart, as is the finish. Rather sour and leafy; an underachiever.",Gran Reserva de Los Andes,83,13.0,Maipo Valley,,,Merlot,Santa Alicia
97799,US,"Despite its relatively low alcohol (11%) this is not so much an off-dry, floral style of Riesling as a yeasty, rather thin wine that suggests very low brix grapes.",,83,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Riesling,Tunnel Hill
97800,US,"Roundly fruity, loaded with bright berries, and nicely spiced with herbal (tobacco) highlights.

97801,US,"This is a very fruity-rich Zinfandel. It pushes the envelope on power and almost goes over the top, but wisely stops short in favor of balance, with acids and tannins providing needed finishing structure. The flavors are big and jammy, suggesting raspberries, cherries, blackberries, plums and chocolate, not to mention huge spiciness. Perfect with short ribs of beef.",Papera Ranch Vineyard,90,29.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Novy
97802,US,"A very rich Syrah, in the Pride style. If it's not particularly complex or subtle, it more than makes up for it with massive fruit and sheer muscle power.

97803,Australia,"One suspects that the 2006 Bin 707 is a special wine, given how well the 407 has turned out. Cassis, mint and cedar are the driving forces, with chocolate and coffee chiming in on the finish.

97805,Italy,"With 16 months of careful oak barrique aging, this opulent wine represents a new generation of Barbera d'Alba.

97962,Australia,"The color is dark and dense and so are the aromas, which show plenty of vanilla oak and mulberry fruit. As you might expect from winemaker Ben Glaetzer and the Mitolo family, this is a full-bodied Shiraz, albeit not quite as lush and riveting as the 2005 version. The tannins this year are soft, the acids a bit on the tart side, giving the fruit a crisp edge. Probable drinking window: 2010–2020.",Savitar,90,66.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Mitolo

97967,US,"Pale in color but powerful in flavor, this Pinot is perfumed in cherry, cola, rose petal, roasted cedar wood and pepper aromas, with similar flavors.

97972,Italy,"This is an elegant wine with measured but well-dosed aromas of cherry fruit, leather, tobacco and spice.

97973,Italy,"This is an extremely well balanced Riserva (with 15% Merlot in the blend) that plays with various elements—fruit, toast and mineral—extremely well.

Restrained but flavorful, it's an excellent food pairing choice.",,90,20.0,Franschhoek,,,Shiraz,Lynx
97975,Chile,"Priced just above the Best Buy level, Quatro is still a great value. MontGras brings Cabernet, Malbec, Carmenère and Syrah together in a well-meshed way.

97978,US,"Reminiscent of the 2000, this wine has a crisp, linear character that emphasizes minerals rather than the overt tropical fruits the vineyard shows in warmer vintages.

Long and uncompromised on the finish.",Reserva,89,13.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Misiones de Rengo
97982,US,"Strong in tannins and showing an earthy, tough aggressiveness, this Cabernet lacks immediate charm. There's an old-fashioned dryness about it, rather like the old Inglenooks and Louis Martinis that aged forever. Perhaps it will, too.

But a second or third sip reveals a surprisingly sleek complexity—hints of pine and lime zest on the palate, racy acidity and a long finish marked by a steely, dark minerality.",Evergreen Lek Vineyard Dry,89,20.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Keuka Lake Vineyards
98000,US,"Aromatic and appealing, this perfectly captures the pretty orange peel and citrus scents of the grape.

98001,Spain,"Fresh, dry and elevated by any conventional cava standards. The nose breathes lime, green apple and spice notes, while the palate is crisp, peppery and lightly toasted. Apple and controlled citrus are the fruit components, and then a light yeasty character arises on the finish. A pretty, feminine brut nature to drink now and over the next few years.",Gran Reserva Brut Nature,89,,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Marqués de Gelida
98002,New Zealand,"The 2009 vintage is shaping up to be a good one for Martinborough Pinot Noir, and this bottling is nicely priced for the quality.

Drink now–2016.",Russian Jack,89,20.0,Martinborough,,,Pinot Noir,Martinborough Vineyard
98003,Spain,"Fleshy and rich, with a clear reflection of barrel fermentation on the nose, palate and finish. This is plump Verdejo with match stick and toasty vanilla on the bouquet.

98009,US,"A textbook, modern Napa Cabernet that offers plenty of varietal pleasure, with blackberry, cassis, chocolate and oak flavors liberally framed in fine sweet oak, and wrapped into luxurious tannins.

98010,US,"This is Bonterra's best Syrah in many years. It's not an ageable blockbuster, built along Northern Rhône lines, but is a gentle, soft wine for immediate enjoyment.

98014,US,"It's so easy to get a big Zin wrong, especially in a hot vintage like 2004, but Taft Street does a good juggling act with this single-vineyard Zin, made from century-old vines.

98016,US,"From one of the westernmost vineyards in the county, just a few miles from the chilly Pacific, comes this dark, intense Pinot.

98023,Chile,"Quite Bordeaux in style, meaning the wine is leaner, tighter and more tannic than typical Southern Hemisphere blends usually amount to. But we very much like the wine's mineral, plum and juicy raspberry flavors. All in all, expect a sturdy, well-made wine with plenty of natural and barrel-aided tannins. Will likely improve with another year or two in bottle.",Los Vascos Reserve,88,21.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Red Blend,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite)

98029,US,"Pure Cabernet Sauvignon from Pepper Bridge and Seven Hills goes into this elegant, crisp and nicely balanced wine. It's quite a change from the winery's 2004, which used different vineyard sources and (seemingly) a different mix of barrels.

98051,US,"Plenty of flavor in this extremely ripe wine. Bursting with blackberry and cherry pie filling, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors, it's clearly delicious. Yet it's a very soft wine.

In Washington's Wahluke Slope, Zin ripens well without turning into a Port-like substance.

It shows excellent floral aspects, like a good Beaujolais - it's somewhere between Pinot Noir and Gamay, with big fat grapes and heavy clusters that somehow produce a real finesse wine.

98334,US,"Though nicely styled, this does not quite feel like a reserve wine; it's just too light. Flavors are well-defined, showing strawberry, raspberry and Bing cherry in equal proportions.

98339,US,"The cool climate of the northern Salinas Valley enabled the grapes to hang long into the harvest while maintaining bright acidity. The result is a lovely Riesling, off-dry and refreshing in the manner of a fine German wine. It was blended with a splash of Muscat.

The finish shows tobacco and smoky flavors.",,88,,Bordeaux,Pessac-Léognan,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Coquillas

Drink now through 2012.",Tinto Figuero 12 Crianza,89,29.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,García Figuero
98544,US,"What a nice Zin. Shows all the Dry Creek character you could ask for, with briary, brambly flavors of wild forest berries, peppery spices and chocolate-covered mints. Savory and delicious, a fine wine to drink now with barbecue. Alcohol is very high, but somehow the wine doesn't taste hot.",Stone Ranch,89,28.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,DeLorimier
98545,Australia,"The blend in this wine is as whimsical as the name, with Tempranillo and Grenache alongside Portugal's Tinta Cão and Souzão grapes. The result is an aggressive, powerful wine with a broad palette of aromas and flavors, ranging from vanilla, forest floor and animal sweat to cigar, flint, blackberry jam and coffee. Big, bold tannins. Better after 2011.",The Sticks & Stones Tempranillo-Grenache-Tintacao-Souzao,89,35.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Red Blend,D'Arenberg
98546,France,"Cool, calm wine, its fruit and tannins kept nicely in check. There is a classic feel here, square and elegant. The berry fruits are bright, with a spurt of sweet and sour acidity. Age for 3–4 years.",,89,20.0,Bordeaux,Haut-Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Cambon la Pelouse
98547,France,"The fruit is really ripe, botrytised, quite tight in character, the layers of tangerine and orange juice wedged into a dry core. This will need many years.",,89,,Bordeaux,Sauternes,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Filhot
98548,France,"With 14 months' new wood aging, this wine is still all wood and toast. The wine does have weight, with the promise of blackberry fruits under the firm tannins. It is finely structured and should mature well.",Péché du Roy,89,18.0,Bordeaux,Côtes de Bourg,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Haut-Guiraud
98549,Germany,"Soft at first, but the density of the pine, gardenia and spice flavors emerges as the wine opens up while the lingering finish shows excellent purity of fruit. Serve with sushi. Drink now or hold three to four years for more complexity.",Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Kabinett,89,23.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,St. Urbans-Hof
98550,US,"Opens with a blast of freshly ground black peppercorns, and that peppery tastes travels into the flavor. A very unusual and distinctive wine, it's absolutely, refreshingly dry, with richer notes of cherries, currants and tangerine zest, finishing with a swirl of spicy anise, clove and cinnamon.",Red Huerhuero,89,14.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Red Blend,Vina Robles
98551,Australia,"On the side, with a hint of warmth on the finish, this is nevertheless a very good wine. The aromas are powerfully mineral, accented by bold lime notes, while the flavors are intense and concentrated. Drink now.",,89,17.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Riesling,Wakefield Estate
98552,France,"It is sweet, there's no doubt about it, but it takes a while for this wine to develop in the mouth. Initally, there is just a fresh white pear flavor. Only gradually does the relatively gentle sweetness come through, reinforced by botrytis but balanced by intense acidity.",Clos du Pavillon,89,,Loire Valley,Coteaux du Layon Saint Aubin,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine Philippe Delesvaux
98553,Italy,"Dark in color with thick concentration, this “family” Riserva offers loads of spice lavished over fresh cherry, red fruit and plum. In the mouth, the wine feels thick, chewy and well concentrated with ripe cherry flavors that ride over the long finish.",Riserva di Famiglia,89,38.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Cecchi
98554,Italy,"There's a hint of initial ripeness or stewiness on the nose in the form of blackberry preserves and strawberry but it's not enough to be a problem. In fact, the wine comes in line with just a few swirls of the glass to reveal more delicate and ethereal notes of spice and vanilla.",Riserva,89,43.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Castello di Verrazzano
98555,South Africa,"A layered nose with aromas of grapefruit, lemon and flowers is the start of this poised and pretty white. Crisp acidity, great balance and fresh, approachable fruit come together to offer an elegant, reliable sip. Pair with spicy foods, grilled fish or salads.",The Steppe Buzzard,89,15.0,Coastal Region,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Bellingham
98556,US,"A nice, pleasant sipper, lovely on its own as an aperitif, with wonderfully crisp acidity and a stony minerality balancing rich flavors of citrus fruits and wildflowers. Feels elegant and clean throughout.",La Encantada Vineyard,89,30.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Gris,Alma Rosa
98557,New Zealand,"Steve Bird, who put Thornbury on the map before selling that brand to Villa Maria's owner, is back with a fairly rich, amply endowed Sauvignon Blanc. It's grassier to smell than to taste, with stone fruit and grapefruit flavors and just a hint of herbaceousness on the palate.",Old Schoolhouse Vineyard,89,20.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Bird
98558,Portugal,"The minerality that seems to come from this quinta makes for a wine that needs time, and this wine is defiantly young. However, its chocolate flavors, bitter toast and dense structure all promise well.",Quinta do Coa,89,26.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,CARM
98559,US,"A bit heavy in body, and very extracted, this single-vineyard Pinot from Boonville has jammy flavors of cherries, raspberries and currants. Extensive new oak adds layers of caramelized meringue. Tasty, although a bit obvious, the wine should hold its own for 5 years.",Frattey Shams Vineyard,89,55.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
98560,New Zealand,"A drier, more minerally style than many coming out of Marlborough, with white grapefruit flavors that come across as brisk and refreshing. There's fruit weight on the palate, with the sort of stony flavors that pair with virtually any seafood dish.",,89,21.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Huia
98561,Chile,"Put this on the scale and watch it tip. It's a monster of a Cab that's quite tannic and therefore narrow on the palate. But if given time in a good cellar it may soften into something much more evolved than it is now. Early openers should expect black fruit in spades, with nail-like tannins. Best to have a steak on the grill if you are drinking this any time soon.",Cuvée Alexandre Apalta Vineyard,89,25.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lapostolle
98562,US,"The 2005 vintage was kind to this wine, grown in the warmer, northerly Middle Reach section of the valley. While lacking the depth of the 2002 and 2003, it shows flavorful black currants, cherries and root beer, with a peppery finish. The tannins are rich and fine. Small additions of Zin, Malbec, Petite Sirah and other red varieties add complexity.",DaKine Vineyard,89,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Longboard
98563,US,"Very tight now, with minerally, yeasty flavors of lees and unintegrated smoky new oak. High acidity adds to the impression of austerity. Difficult to appreciate in its infancy, but this elegant, layered, complex Chard should begin to blossom after 2008 and hold for several years.",Lucia Highlands Vineyard Estate,89,26.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Pessagno
98564,South Africa,"Lively and elegant, this fruit-filled wine from Kevin Arnold is perfect for a gourmet meal in the summer. Fresh tropical fruit flavors like lychee mingle with a balanced acidity and impressive mouthfeel. Long finish.",,89,22.0,Stellenbosch,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Waterford
98565,Chile,"Dark cola, black fruit and marzipan aromas give this a sweet bouquet. The palate is solid, with medium-strength tannins supporting cherry, blackberry and mocha flavors. Oak is no stranger to this wine, so expect ample vanilla and chocolate throughout. A bit herbal, which is common for Chilean Cabernet.",Orzada,89,20.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Odfjell
98566,South Africa,"A big, exuberant nose leads on this impressive Syrah. On the palate, it's a muscular red, with balance, strength and elegant tannins. Mouthfilling but minerally enough to maintain poise, it will age well or pair now with roasted meat.",,89,37.0,Stellenbosch,,,Syrah,Rudi Schultz
98567,Italy,"There's a fun, spicy layer in the foreground of this wine that helps shape a modern, luscious and intense Chianti Classico with noticeable sophistication and dimension. It offers a lot of consistency and flavor and carries those elements forward over its long finish. Only 250 cases were made.",,89,,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Montecalvi
98568,Portugal,"The first vintage from Quinta de la Rosa's new joint venture with winemaker Jorge Moreira in the high Douro. It's rich, sweet, opulent, with tarry tannins and delicious black fruit. The tannins are just a supplement to the fruit.",Passagem,89,,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta de Bandeiras
98569,US,"This appellation is better known for red wines, but Bink is establishing a really good track record for this variety that's so hard to get balanced. The wine, which appears to have little if any oak, brims with acid-bright citrus, lemongrass, vanilla and pepper flavors. It appeals especially for its succulent balance.",Randle Hill Vineyard,89,20.0,California,Yorkville Highlands,North Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Bink
98570,Portugal,"Fresh, jammy strawberry aromas, followed by a soft, balanced wine, with tannins and wood in fine harmony. It's ripe, packed with berry fruits, edged with dry tannins. The strawberry gives a fresh aftertaste.",Quinta dos Quatros Ventos Colheita,89,29.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Caves Aliança
98571,Chile,"Lo Mejor is the most elevated, worldly Pinot in the Corpora group's portfolio (Veranda, Porta and Agustinos are others). It is ripe and smoky, with alluring berry aromas and smooth black cherry and raspberry flavors. It's warm and a bit fiery on the finish, but with food that won't be a big factor. A good example of what Bío Bío can do with Pinot Noir.",Sereno Reserva Lo Mejor Santa Ana Estate,89,20.0,Bío Bío Valley,,,Pinot Noir,Gracia de Chile
98572,US,"This Syrah shows the bright fruit and crisp, organizing acidity of Domaine Alfred's Chamisal botting, which is their reserve, without quite the lushness and power. Nonetheless, it's a fine Syrah, firm and dry in tannins, with fat, sappy texture framing jammy cherry, blackberry and peppery fruit.",Chamisal Vineyards,89,28.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Domaine Alfred
98573,New Zealand,"A bold, flavorful Chardonnay with a long track record of excellence, Pegasus Bay's 2006 is smoky and toasty, with orange and pineapple fruit flavors that linger on the finish.",,89,37.0,Waipara Valley,,,Chardonnay,Pegasus Bay

The wine has class and character and is a perfect food-pairing choice.",Natural Unwooded,89,15.0,Robertson,,,Chardonnay,Rietvallei Estate Wine
98575,US,"Part of this wine was barrel fermented, which gives it a creamy, spicy richness. The rest was raised in stainless steel, preserving vital fruitiness and acidity. The result is a richly powerful, interesting wine, vibrant in citrus, fig, melon and spice flavors, that finishes thoroughly dry. Sommeliers should note this wine, not only for its inexpensive price but for its versatility and sophistication.",,89,15.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Robert Hall
98576,South Africa,"A lively, toasted spice nose rolls into friendly, flirty, light and balanced flavors on this Chardonnay. Balanced fruit and minerality and a curvy but fresh finish add to the appeal. An elegant wine with personality.",,89,22.0,Stellenbosch,,,Chardonnay,Waterford
98577,US,"This unusual and distinctive Zin has a silky texture and rich, finely ground tannins. The flavors range from classic black and red currants, mulberries, cloves and pepper to pastry flavors of coconut macaroon and fig cookie. Could easily develop over a decade.",Feeney Vineyard,89,48.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
98578,Italy,"There's a subtle candy-like element to this wine's pretty nose that recalls vanilla and cherries sprinkled with dried flowers and green herbs. The wine has a lean, compact feel in the mouth and refreshes the palate thanks to its blueberry flavors and crisp close.",Riserva,89,,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Tenuta di Lilliano
98579,New Zealand,"This is a big, broad-shouldered Sauvignon Blanc, slightly oily in texture, with pungent scents of crushed tomato leaf and plenty of gooseberry fruit. The high alcohol, moderate acidity and richly concentrated fruit give the impression of sweetness on the long finish.",Reserve,89,30.0,Wairau Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Villa Maria
98580,US,"Rich and spicy, this lusty Zin shows how well the variety does in Russian River Valley. Aged in American oak, it's deep and long in cherry, cranberry, licorice, cola, cinnamon and paprika spice flavors. Best now, with rich meat dishes and hard cheeses.",,87,21.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Balletto
98581,Italy,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese and Merlot delivers warm tones of mature berry fruit with nice earthy renderings and a determined, mineral-driven backbone. Delicate aromas of berry fruit and dried violets are backed by deep spice flavors and firm tannins that are slightly on the green side.",Foresco,87,18.0,Central Italy,Umbria,,Red Blend,Barberani
98582,Italy,"This Sangiovese offers a pretty ruby color with thickly saturated color and segues into pretty aromas of spice, wood, red cherry and Asian spice. It has a wide, broad approach and very far-reaching intensity. But it also has many burnt wood nuances that boarder on being too heavy, especially considering the wine's delicate core of red fruit. The mouthfeel is just as overdone with deep menthol and cola flavors and a long, spicy finish.",Calistri,87,,Central Italy,Umbria,,Sangiovese,Castello di Corbara
98583,Italy,"Sangiovese (50%) is blended with equal parts Merlot and Cabernet to produce a simple red wine with thin berry fruit aromas, forest berry, floral nuances and some sharp points of bright acidity. Elegance and harmony are the objective and the wine reaches it nicely. It's also an easy wine with good length that would pair easily with all Mediterranean foods.",Red Blend,87,17.0,Central Italy,Lago di Corbara,,Red Blend,Castello di Corbara
98584,Austria,"A deliciously  crisp and fresh wine with some good concentrated fruit, but more attractive acidity. There is just a hint of spice, but freshness is what this wine is all about.",Kollmitz Federspiel,87,,Wachau,,,Riesling,Machherndl
98585,New Zealand,"Starts off with minerally hints of stone dust and melon, then develops ripe red currant and fig flavors on the full-bodied palate.

98586,US,"From a vineyard north of St. Helena comes this 100% varietal wine. If you like your Cabs soft, superextracted and direct, you'll love it. The blackberry and cherry flavors are so ripe and sweet, they taste like pie filling. Best now and for a couple years.",Shibumi Vineyard,87,85.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Shibumi Knoll
98587,US,"Made in the Trinchero style, which traditionally has been a little monochromatic on first release, but ageable. Tastes fairly basic in upfront Cabernet flavors of black currants and blackberries, with a soft, oaky finish. Should develop bottle complexity over the next decade.",Main Street Vineyard,87,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trinchero
98588,Italy,"No doubt this is an easy-drinking wine, but it also has a good dose of opulence and richness in the form of creamy honey aromas, peach blossom and Golden Delicious apple. The mouthfeel is lean and pristine and the wine offers bright freshness on the close and a burst of cleansing power from the alcohol.",Le Marsure,87,,Northeastern Italy,Venezia Giulia,,Pinot Grigio,Teresa Raiz
98589,US,"Patianna has established a fine track record with this keen, fresh Sauvignon Blanc. Grown biodynamically, with no oak at all, the wine brims with crisp acidity. That brightens the lime, apricot, green apple and vanilla flavors that finish with a steely minerality.",,87,18.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Sauvignon Blanc,Patianna
98590,Italy,This 70-30 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot-Alicante is a third cousin to the estate's top wine Splendido (a similar blend of grapes made in a more sophisticated manner). This is a well-priced version that is simple and clean with bursting flavors of red fruit and cherry.,Corale,87,14.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Poggio alle Sughere
98591,Hungary,"A bright, spicy, appetizing nose recommends this, and on the tongue, the wine continues to impress. Balanced flavors of deep berry, mocha and warming spice offer heft without heaviness, and the finish is both long and full of character. The wine has a friendly nature that lends it to food pairing.",,87,29.0,Villány,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gere Attila
98592,US,"This is fairly soft and sweet, with pleasant flavors of peaches and honey. It is a well-made late harvest Chenin, but simple. Compared with the complexity and the persistence of the Chenin Blanc ice wine, it seems quite simple, though perfectly sound.",Late Harvest Chenin Blanc,87,25.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,White Blend,Chateau Ste. Michelle
98593,Chile,"Full and confident on the nose, with a wide range of berry aromas. The palate is medium in weight and power, but the flavors are entirely ripe and juicy, with an emphasis on raspberry and plum. Not overpowering but still it shows Chile's ability to produce wall-to-wall red wines at moderate prices.",Reserva,87,10.0,Maule Valley,,,Syrah,Chilcas
98594,Argentina,"This plump, ripe Malbec is aggressive and jumpy on the nose, but the flavors of blackberries and chocolate are pure and positively represent what Argentina can do with value-priced Malbec.

98600,US,"This blend of all the Bordeaux varieties satisfies for its wealth of well-ripened fruit. It just floods the mouth with the flavors of crushed, perfectly ripe blackberries, black raspberries and wild cherries, picked under the warm summer sun. Oak adds smoky nuances.

98602,US,"Very sweet, with honey-rich apricot, tangerine, vanilla cookie and crème brûlée flavors, this late-harvest Chard satisfies for sheer opulence. It has just enough acidity to balance all that sweetness.",Reserve Late Harvest,87,36.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Prix
98603,New Zealand,"Pretty standard in terms of flavor profile, but well-executed, marrying toasty, pain grille aromas with flavors of vanilla, ripe pears and melon. Medium- to full-bodied, it finishes with a flourish of oak and spice.",,87,20.0,Martinborough,,,Chardonnay,Te Kairanga
98604,Argentina,"With this wine, you'll get a solid blast of oak and butter on the nose, which is backed by orange, melon and nectarine flavors. There's acidity and kick to it, but also some softer butterscotch and citrus pith notes. More than good by Argentine standards.",Broquel,87,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Trapiche
98605,New Zealand,"Extremely smooth and silky in texture, this elegantly crafted wine features aromas and flavors of cedar, sassafras and chocolate, with some berry fruit showing through on the finish. It's not a big, sturdy wine, so pair it with something more delicate, like roast chicken.",Private Bin,87,16.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,Villa Maria
98606,US,"Two of the crispest and most savory white varieties in California are Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Gris/Grigio, and this blend of both shows the best qualities of each. It's just slightly off-dry and vibrant in citrus, fig, melon and vanilla flavors, with beautiful acidity.",Blanc Gris,87,18.0,California,California,California Other,White Blend,Vision Cellars
98607,US,"This is firm and well-oaked, with the customary high alcohol levels that Spring Valley has been able to manage so well in the past. But at 15+% one expects to find commensurate weight and density; this feels like a much lighter wine, as far as the fruit concentration is concerned. The tannins are still a bit rough and slightly bitter, and the cherry fruit flavors not quite up to carrying all that new oak.",Muleskinner,87,35.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Spring Valley Vineyard

98624,US,"Tough, dry and tannic, this Cabernet punches its way through the mouth like an angry kickboxer.

98632,US,"Given the star wine treatment (21 months in 100% new French oak barrels), this has to be a victim of the recession. You don't put a $14 wine in super-expensive French oak.

98633,Spain,"Roasted plum and raspberry aromas offer accents of vanilla, dill and dry wood.

98637,US,"Miner has struggled with this wine, which comes from the Central Valley, over the years, but with this '09, they've achieved a breakthrough.

98647,US,"A spectacular Pinot Noir, but a very young one, and extremely dry. It's a wine of great structure, with rich acids and tannins framing extraordinarily complex flavors of grilled cherries, strawberries and raspberries, with complicating notes of cola, pomegranates, orange zest, anise, dusty Asian spices and smoky sandalwood. A truly great Pinot Noir from a great vintage that needs time in the bottle to express itself.

98648,Australia,"This prodigious wine showcases Barossa's ability to deliver big, mouthfilling flavors without any suggestion of heat or heaviness. Scents of stone fruit, pepper and red currants mark the nose, while the flavors take on a darker cast, heading toward black cherries and black olives.

98649,US,"Ripe and delicious right out of the bottle, although it will age well. Made from a vineyard on the true Sonoma Coast, in the remote Fort Ross area, it's fabulously rich in cherry, framboise and red currant flavors, with intriguing waves of anise, bacon and sweet, vanilla-scented smoky sandalwood. There's a foresty taste, too, suggesting dried pine needles. The tannins and acids are near perfect. Stunning now, and should hold for at least six years.",Precious Mountain Vineyard,98,90.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
98650,US,"Always one of Williams Selyem's top Pinot Noirs, the 2007 is a spectacular wine. The vines are the closest to the river in the famed Rochioli vineyard, and the resulting wine always has an elegant structure and fruity accessibility that make it drinkable at a younger age. Showing rich flavors of cherries, red currants, cola, bacon, anise, Asian spices and smoky oak, it will develop beautifully over the next decade.",Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard,97,75.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
98651,US,"Not showing well now due to the tannins. It's dry and tough, with a resistance to the richness. Yet the core of flavor is enormous. Shows concentrated, flashy flavors of cherry marmalade, raspberry, orange blossom, cola, licorice, rose tea and spices that go on and on and continue to develop in the glass. The texture is pure silk and satin. Needs 4–6 years to develop, and could go beyond that.",Allen Vineyard,97,78.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem

98653,US,"A brilliant wine. Racy in acidity, silky in texture, yet powerful, it exudes the essence of Pinot Noir's greatness. Shows great fruity ripeness in the cherry, Dr. Pepper cola, licorice and bacon flavors, and also a wild, forest quality of grilled mushrooms, thyme and fennel. Absolutely dry, with a firm spine of tannins, the structure is near perfect.

Erupts in the most complex blackberries, black currants, licorice and 100% new smoky oak flavors, with a spicy finish that goes on and on. The tannins are strong and fine and impressive.

98658,US,"The winery's philosophy is, if you're going to make a dessert wine, why not make it fabulously sweet instead of boringly off-dry? With 17.5% residual sugar, this indeed hits the limit of the sweetness scale. Yet it's superbly balanced with acidity, giving a refreshing balance to the intense apricot jam, lemon drop, candied ginger, pineapple crème brûlée and vanilla custard flavors.

98661,US,"Beautiful from start to finish, but tannic, and not drinkable now, in the classic sense.

98663,US,"Very powerful, very strong, almost overwhelming in the sheer wealth of fruit and oak, but balanced with acidity.

98665,US,"One for the cellar. It's vibrantly rich and forward in blackberries, black cherries, plums, dark chocolate and sweet smoky new oak, yet very tannic.

98673,Australia,"Perhaps this just needs some additional time for the Cabernet and Shiraz components to meld, because right now it comes across as slightly chunky and warm, with cassis and plum flavors verging on prune, yet nicely framed by vanilla and cedar.

98711,US,"Do not pop the cork and drink this right away as it's currently tight and tannic. But as it warms up and breathes, it releases its considerable charms. With 16% Viognier blended in, it's fantastically rich and concentrated in black-pepper-accented raspberry and sweet-smoke flavors. Acidity adds balance to the richness. You can enjoy this wine now, after an hour in the decanter, or cellar it for at least six years.",Toasted Rope,94,44.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Foxen

Few Chardonnays in the state are this streamlined, low in alcohol, crisp and minerally.

98720,US,"This barrel selection aptly defines Hunnicutt's style of ripe, sweetly concentrated fruit.

98725,US,"Made from 100% Cabernet grown in the Beckstoffer Georges III Vineyard, and aged in mostly new French and American oak, its tannins are tough as nails. Yet there's a vast core of blackberry and black cherry fruit that's just yearning to break out.

98730,US,"This wine remains astringent in tannins, with a lockded-down mouthfeel that's hard to get past. But it's very rich in blackberry and cherry fruit. Is it worth aging?

98772,US,"The Wallula vineyard, set high atop a bluff overlooking the Columbia river, gives grapes that bring dark, roasted flavors to the large-scale wine. The fruit tastes as if it has been pushed, perhaps a bit too far, and the impression it leaves tilts toward the raisiny side.

98795,US,"With a crisp spine of zesty acidity and thick but finely ground tannins, this Syrah gives a beautiful structure to the flavors.

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Syrah,Ojai
98796,US,"Soft and creamy and very elegant, this Chard has rich flavors of apricot tart, pineapple, Meyer lemon and chalky minerals. Really a well-structured, pulled-together wine of enormous appeal. Should improve through 2012.",Clos Pepe Vineyard,93,40.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Ojai
98797,US,"This is the opposite of those gooey, cult-style wines grown down on the valley benches and floor. It's pure mountain in the tannins, acidity and dryness, with below 14% alcohol. It's a food wine, with cassis, cedar and mineral flavors. Should age well for a decade.",,93,45.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Smith-Madrone
98798,US,"Very ripe and full-bodied, with firm yet well-developed tannins. Despite its power, there's a feminine charm in the softly elaborate texture and opulent flavors.

98799,France,"Chidaine, based across the Loire in Montlouis, has only recently begun making wine from Vouvray as well. Le Bouchet is an off-dry wine that balances a core of minerality and acidity against intense richness. Flavors of sweet plums, apricots and almonds ride beautifully into the soft finish.",Le Bouchet,93,21.0,Loire Valley,Vouvray,,Chenin Blanc,François Chidaine
98800,US,"Tim Mondavi and family strive to join the pantheon of cult wine with this, his second vintage of a Cab-based Bordeaux blend.

98801,US,"Made in a lighter, silkier, more accessible style, this is an elegant Pinot Noir that suggests lamb, roast salmon and other upscale dishes.

98802,US,"Three things mark this Pinot: considerable oak, acidity and fruity ripeness. Offers decadently delicious waves of cherry pie filling, raspberry tart, anise, cinnamon, vanilla and cedar. Needs time for all these elements to meld. Best 2010–2013.",Frattey Shams Vineyard,93,60.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
98803,US,"The Ovide blend stands out for its round, sweet cherry fruit, enhanced with the earthy, composty richness of biodynamically farmed wines.

98805,France,"A wine to taste in 10 years. Just starting out, it is rich, hinting at honey with mango and custard fruit flavors. Along with the fruit, there is some dry botrytis that gives the core of the wine a tight, dry texture. As with all great Loire sweet wines, the wonderful richness is balanced with a steely acidity.",Cuvée des Nonnes Moelleux,93,,Loire Valley,Savennières-Roche-Aux-Moines,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine aux Moines
98806,France,"Baumard's signature wine, named after the butterfly shape of the vineyard, is pure, exotic Chenin Blanc, rich, but not losing sight of the essential minerality of Savennières, its stony element coming through in the tight texture.

98807,US,"Just beautiful, so well-crafted and balanced. With an edge of tannins and acids, could be an ager for a while.

98808,US,"Always among the very best of the McCrea Syrahs, the 2005 Boushey Grande Côte brings blue fruits, composted earth, unfunky leather, cedar bark, smoked meats and more into play. It's simply one of the most complex Syrahs made anywhere in Washington, from a grand cru site that is absolutely made for the grape. As with the 2004, the flavor notes just keep on coming—cured ham, black truffle, charcoal, pencil lead, toasted nuts.

Bookwalter
98810,US,"This is the first time that Sineann has offered a reserve bottling of this wine, which does step it up even further than the “regular” Baby Poux.

98811,US,"Just what you want from a Sonoma Coast Chard. It's bone dry, crisp in cool-climate acidity, and elegant, with a minerally tang to the Meyer lemon fruit.

98813,US,"Lovely nose, which runs from violets and cherries right into coffee and sweet chocolate. In the mouth the wine coats the palate with Napa-like intensity, only buttressed with more vivid acidity. It's both smooth and deep.

98814,US,"A very fine Viognier, one of the best of the vintage, that takes the variety's exotic, sometimes over-the-top richness and controls it with crisp coastal acidity and a deft touch of minerals.

Drink now for freshness.",,93,24.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Viognier,Fess Parker
98815,Australia,"With only 50 cases imported, this review will be of only academic interest to most consumers, but for those lucky enough to latch onto a bottle or two, try to hold off opening one until 2015 or so. Right now, it's oh so promising, but also very tight.

98816,France,"Rich, finely balanced, an intense botrytis wine, full of sweet spices, honey, baked apples and sugar.

98817,US,"Delicious, massive, full-bodied, almost heavy, this Pinot needs time. It's a concentrated, powerful red wine, showing huge flavors of black cherries, blackberries, mocha, Asian spices and toasty oak.

98818,US,"The best Pedestal since the 2003. The focus is immediately apparent, with dark, toasty scents and flavors wrapped into ripe black fruits.

98819,France,"A dry Vouvray, but one that has so much richness it seems almost sweet. It's a great contrast of flavors—apricots alongside fresh apple juice, lemon, honey and a rich, soft texture.

It's a good wine, made from 100% Cabernet, with finely ground tannins and strong flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate and lots of sweet new oak.

98825,New Zealand,"Matariki's Reserve Cab boasts true varietal notes of mint and cassis upfront, then turns intense and chocolaty on the palate.

98830,US,"A very good Cabernet, rich and dry, but you'll want to decant it for a few hours to let it soften. Right out of the bottle it's rough, giving a gritty feeling to the ripe blackberries and currants. Drink now–2012.",,88,35.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clarbec

98836,US,"Oak sticks out on this Chardonnay, with the aroma and flavor of buttered white toast dominating.

98847,Spain,"Having really liked this wine a couple of years ago, this vintage seems comparatively fierce and aggressive, which isn't to say it isn't hugely flavorful and aromatic.

98851,US,"What makes this wine so good isn't just its fine Pinot Grigio character of crisp acidity and clean, savory citrus fruit flavors, it's also the unusual winemaking method.

98876,Italy,"This boutique Chianti Classico (only 600 cases are made) has a modern, sweet-smelling nose with evident tones of toasted almond, vanilla and coconut that are framed by delicate nuances of blueberry and blue flower typical of Sangiovese. It's lean and compact in the mouth with a burst of fresh fruit on the close.",,88,,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Fattoria di Corsignano
98877,France,"A balanced, ripe wine, packed with pear skins, green apples and cream. It is delicate, with its acidity acting as a fresh, clean blast through the bubbles. Ends with that same freshness.",Tête de Cuvée,88,18.0,Loire Valley,Vouvray,,Chenin Blanc,Château Moncontour
98878,France,"Plum-jam-flavored wine, this is very sweet, rich and very direct. The freshness is here, but this is more about the dense, superripe fruits.",,88,25.0,Beaujolais,Fleurie,,Gamay,Domaine Chignard
98879,France,"Deliciously fresh, this off-dry wine emphasizes the apple flavors of Chenin, its lively acidity balancing the crisp fruit backed by a mineral character. This is likely to age but drinkable now.",,88,,Loire Valley,Coteaux du Layon Saint Aubin,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine Philippe Delesvaux
98880,US,"After almost losing a finger struggling to remove the rock-hard faux wax “capsule” I found this strawberry/cherry cordial-flavored wine quite pleasant. The fruit, from a Rattlesnake Hills vineyard, has a sweet core, while the tannins add an earthy streak of green tea.",Chelle den Millie Reserve,87,36.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Franc,Basel Cellars
98881,Argentina,"A conflicted and hence confounding wine. The nose is very oaky, but it's a pointed, almost piercing wood and clove bouquet. The wine is fierce in the mouth, with kicking tannins and acidity pushing bulldozer-like blackberry and bitter espresso flavors. With 6% Merlot, this Patagonian Malbec has its virtues but isn't as friendly as past vintages.",J. Alberto,87,40.0,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Malbec,Bodega Noemía de Patagonia
98882,Italy,"The wine opens with inky, dark concentration and sweet aromas of vanilla, cedar, espresso, hickory and smoked ham from an obviously elaborate oak-aging regime (it sees 12 months of barrique). It offers dusty, palate-drying tannins in the mouth.",Pagina,87,34.0,Central Italy,Sagrantino di Montefalco,,Sagrantino,Casale Triocco

98884,US,"Showing the typical character of old vine Alexander Valley Zin, this bottling is rich and powerful in black currant, mocha, gingerbread, anise and vanilla spice flavors that are wrapped into sturdy tannins.

98886,Italy,"This is a modern, powerful interpretation of Sangiovese from Umbria that delivers earthy, leather tones as well as sweet spice and black fruit such as prunes and plums. It's a distinctive, and slightly disjointed wine with a few sharp points and plenty of chocolate spice and cinnamon biscuits in the background. The mouthfeel is big and thick with blueberry flavors and broad nutty tones.",,87,15.0,Central Italy,Umbria,,Sangiovese,Chiorri
98887,Italy,"This is a tight, compact and slightly nervous Sangiovese-Canaiolo blend from Umbria that emits loads of intensity and aromatic energy: Forest berry, blueberries violets, leather, nuts and spicy cinnamon all come to mind. It's an easy wine with a streamlined mouthfeel and a touch of thorny sourness on the finish. The natural acidity would make an excellent companion to most pasta dishes.",Rubesco,87,15.0,Central Italy,Torgiano,,Red Blend,Lungarotti
98888,US,"This may be a Syrah that gains balance with some bottle age, but right now, it's a little obvious and overwhelming in extracted blackberry and cassis fruit.

98889,Argentina,"Berry and earth on the nose are welcoming aromas, and overall this juicy, simple Malbec offers clean lines, a touch of complexity and good balance.

98890,Chile,"Early exit polls suggest that 2007 is a good year for Chilean rosé. Or maybe it's just that Chile is figuring out how to make rosé after never having made it prior to a year or two ago. Whatever the case, this is perfectly balanced and tasty. The nose is full and flush, with weight but no granular, overripe aromas. And the palate is juicy and pulses with raspberry and plum flavors. Nice and ready to go.",Reserve,87,9.0,Maipo Valley,,,Rosé,Santa Alicia
98891,New Zealand,"Only light to medium in body, but this wine packs in plenty of authoritative flavor. Baked apple aromas turn tart and lime-like on the finish of this slightly sweet wine that features plenty of crisp acidity for balance.",Premium Selection,87,17.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Selaks
98892,Argentina,"Lots of heavily toasted oak sits atop the bouquet, and thus it's no surprise that the flavor profile runs a bit lemony and sharp. But give the wine time to unfold and you'll find a layer of pure blackberry mixed with notes of chocolate and coffee. Arguably too oaky but with good core qualities.",Famiglia Bianchi,87,18.0,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,Valentin Bianchi
98893,Italy,"A likeable and extremely approachable wine, this Tocai Friulano has a broad aromatic offering with hints of exotic fruit, banana, peach and almond skin.

98895,Italy,"Here is an absolutely unruly and untamed red wine from Umbria with dark, impenetrable concentration and inky tones of black cherry, blackberry, plum, Indian spice and wet granite.

98897,US,"Sweet plum and pie cherry fruit highlights a bright and spicy style. The young vines push all the flavor up front, then hold on for dear life as the midpalate lingers on a note of lightly chocolaty plum. The tannins need some softening; there is a stemmy flavor that slightly mars the finish.",,87,35.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Grenache,Alexandria Nicole
98898,Australia,"There's a touch of wood to this wine, but the primary emphasis is on citrusy, pineapple-scented fruit.

98899,US,"This is 100% varietal. It has muscle and mass, with tart purple and black fruits wrapped into layers of earth and slightly metallic tannins.

This would be an excellent wine with a simple hanger steak.",,87,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Arbor Crest
98900,US,"Stainless- steel fermented, this Chard comes from a very cool part of Russian River Valley. You can taste that in the crisp acids that frame the green apple, pineapple, pear, lime and mineral flavors.",Teresa's,87,18.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Balletto

98902,US,"This is a new brand from Gallo, named after a vineyard the Louis M. Martini winery used to designate. It's a rich, sturdy Merlot, with a thick tannin structure, and shows forward flavors of cherries, black and red currants, licorice, blackberry tea, cola and spice.

It has thick, dense and chewy tannins.",Uno,87,45.0,Central Italy,Sagrantino di Montefalco,,Sagrantino,Tenuta Alzatura
98906,Hungary,"Weninger already makes impressive Blaufränkisch in Austria, so his endeavors with the same grape in Hungary (named Kekfrankos here) are, not surprisingly, successful. A wave of anise, black pepper and blueberry on the nose, paired with smooth, elegant and structured flavors of the same on the palate, impress. The wine has depth but a dry, poised overall character, which gives it a food-friendly edge.",Spern Steiner,87,45.0,Sopron,,,Kekfrankos,Weninger
98907,US,"It's amazing how consistently good Lake County Sauvignon Blancs can be at such a good price, and with their '05, Wildhurst exemplifies these qualities.

98908,Argentina,"Creamy peach and vanilla aromas are perfectly attractive, as is the palate.

98909,Italy,"Made with organically grown Chardonnay from the mountainous Dolomites region of Italy and closed with an innovative glass cork, this is a beautifully aromatic white wine with intensely fragrant notes of acacia flower, melon, peach blossom, honey and Golden Delicious apple.

It doesn't have the sheer force of 2002 or 2005, but it's certainly a classic Rutherford wine, and has a good future. Bone dry, it shows herb-infused flavors of blackberries, cocoa, spices and smoky sandalwood, and yes, the tannins are dusty.

98960,US,"A wonderful wine from one of the best vineyards in Anderson Valley. It's a bit acidic and tannic now, the result of this cool vintage, but time in the bottle should soften and resolve the tartness and astringency. The wine itself is very dry, with flavors of cherries, cola, balsam, Asian spices and oak. Needs aging through at least 2012 to awaken it.",Ferrington Vineyard,94,62.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
98961,Italy,"Mauro Veglio's estate is a small, family run affair that turns out excellent results year after year. A deep understanding of the Nebbiolo grape results in wines that are distinguished by signature aromas of wild berries, mesquite, white truffle and fragrant cedar.

The flavor veers toward Meyer lemon, while toasted oak brings needed vanilla and honey richness. It's controlled and tight, compared to more opulent bottlings, but it's also elegant and complex.

99038,US,"Gin-like botanical nuances in the nose introduce a sharp, rather stiff and hard Pinot Gris. Grapefruit and lemon rind flavors, along with plenty of acidity, seem less ripe than the 14.3% alcohol would suggest.",,86,17.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Southern Oregon,Pinot Gris,RoxyAnn

99062,US,"There's a good streak of acidity behind this dry wine, which is fortunate because the tannins are very soft.

99063,US,"This bottling has been variable over the years, and the '04 is not showing it at its best.

99082,US,"This delicious wine, made entirely from Cab Sauvignon grapes, displays clear varietal character and balance.

99083,US,"A blend of Viognier, Roussanne and Grenache Blanc, this wine is slightly sweet and simple, despite high acidity. There's a firm minerality to the honeysuckle, pineapple and oak flavors. The challenge for the winemaker is to make the wine drier.",,86,30.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Rhône-style White Blend,Nadia
99084,Italy,"Unlike most Dolcettos, this is laid back; it doesn't announce itself with a great blast of fruit. Instead it offers a package of spices and blackberry jam throughout the palate.

99088,US,"This is solidly made, with rough, chewy tannins and hard fruit flavors that show concentrated plum and cassis. Everything is in good proportion, although the acids are a bit chalky and the high alcohol (just under 15%) takes it away from classic Bordeaux flavors. It would be nice to see the ripeness ramped down a notch, because the mix of grapes is right and there's good fruit here. It just has been ripened to the point where the alcohol takes over.",,86,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Meritage,DiStefano
99089,Argentina,"Graffigna has shown improvement with its current set of releases. This Cab starts out dark, charred and full of blackberry aromas and flavors.

Bookwalter
99097,US,"With the extra bottle age, this newest release of McCrea's Boushey/Ciel blend is powerful, but approachable.

This wine has the muscle and concentration to go another decade in the cellar.",Cuvée Orleans,92,40.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,McCrea Cellars
99098,Italy,"One of the first things you notice here is the sweetness and fullness of the fruit.

99102,US,"Savoy is one of the best-known vineyards in Anderson Valley, and with the rich, ripe 2007 vintage, Roessler has produced a Pinot of considerable heft. It's a big, thick wine, showing primary flavors of black cherries, mulberries, raw beef, soy and cedar. Feels drily tart and sandpapery now, and should be better after 2011.",Savoy,92,46.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Roessler
99103,Italy,"Here's a wine from Central Italy (the Adriatic flank of the peninsula) that rivals the intensity and sophistication of Bordeaux.

99108,US,"This is 100% varietal, supple and juicy with concentrated black fruits, all in fine balance. Tight, complex and compact, it's drinkable right now for the primary, berry flavors; but it's not a simple wine; cellaring will allow it to evolve and bring out the more subtle textures, the elegant mix of herbs; all the things that make pure Cabernet such a pleasure when it's done well.",,92,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hestia Cellars

99122,US,"There is a sharpness to the aroma, a pungent mix of pineapple and pine needle, that leads into a fairly light palate with lemon oil, citrus fruit and a hint of orange hard candy.

99127,France,"The alcohol certainly gives the wine richness, but it manages to sustain it well, with superripe black plum and damson flavors, dusty tannins and a powerful texture that rolls richly around the mouth. It leaves a sweet and juicy aftertaste like old-style Rioja.",,88,30.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château de Ferrand
99128,New Zealand,"Despite 13.5 g/l of residual sugar, this wine's crisp acids give it a dry impression that verges on austerity. Green apple and lime flavors end on a note of mouthdrying stone dust.",Fletcher Family Vineyard,88,20.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Craggy Range
99129,Australia,"On the quiet side for a Grenache, with reticent notes of spice, sangria and cassis. There's the faintest grip of tannin and a crisp, strawberry-inflected finish. Drink now.",The Custodian,88,19.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Grenache,D'Arenberg

99135,US,"The 2006 vintage was not kind to Beringer's Cabernets, and this esteemed bottling is no exception. It's tough and gritty, the kind of wine that may have a future but whose present is not particularly acceptable at this price. Extreme tannins lock it down. Tastes almost old-fashioned.

It could come around after many years.",Private Reserve,88,115.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
99136,Spain,"Solid if a bit soupy and tomato-driven on the nose. In the mouth, there's a nice offset between herbal, red fruit characteristics, tobacco and black fruit.

99137,New Zealand,"There's a slight coppery tinge to this wine's hue, which can't help but influence perceptions of aroma and flavor.

99139,US,"This is a big, strong, fruity, oaky wine that's not showing much subtlety now.

99169,US,"This Zin is so fresh and jammy in raspberries, cherries and blackberries, you wonder why they didn't hold it back for a while, to let the flavors meld. Tasted in March 2008, it still had that acid-forward, crushed berry tartness you find in wine straight out of the fermenter. But it's a very good Zin that will improve in the bottle.

99172,Australia,"This medium-bodied wine is a stylistic departure from the stereotypical Aussie stainless-steel Sauvignon Blanc, being fermented and aged in old French oak barrels for eight months. The result is a citrusy wine with greater depth and richer texture, even some leesy, slightly toasty notes that complement rather than overwhelm the fruit.

99179,Italy,"The wine makes a wonderful first impression thanks to its vibrant intensity and penetrating aromas of cherry, cola, almond and spice.

99181,New Zealand,"The 2004 vintage wasn't that kind to Marlborough Pinot Noir, but the country's largest winery has managed to turn in a solid effort with their top wine.

99185,Hungary,"A spicy, gamy nose of cloves and red berry lead on this impressive Merlot, and on the palate, it's assertive but smooth, with spicy smoke and clove waves and a slightly tart berry character.

99187,US,"The powerful flavors of this Syrah are both its strength and weakness. No question it's a delicious wine, upfront in blackberry pie filling, currant, licorice, dark chocolate and peppery spices. However the very power of flavor makes it hard to pair with subtle food. Best with strong plates, like short ribs or beef tamales.",,87,30.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Dogwood

99194,US,"Pun alert. Matchless might suggest a peerless wine, but then you notice that the label has been burnt, as if in a fire. The blend is roughly two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one third Syrah, and the wine is broadly fruity in the Walla Walla style, with suggestions of cherry pie and berry jam. The finish has a rather chalky feel, with chewy tannins.",Matchless Red,87,26.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Otis Kenyon

99202,US,"This limited (350 case) release is 86% Merlot, the rest Cabernet Sauvignon. There is significant influence from new oak barrels, and the wine is better for it.

99204,US,"From young vines, this has been cofermented with Viognier, and it is a firm—almost hard—and tannic wine, with good grip.

A full degree of alcohol lower than the 2009, it's bone dry, brisk in acidity, and stimulating in its minerally taste and texture—like a lick of cold steel.

99387,Italy,"At first, the Damilano seemed fairly non-descript; a little fruit and earth, a tight short palate and little finish. But once it had been swirled and aired, it became more interesting; the fruit became more pronounced showing an attractive apricot and floral quality, while the earthiness became smoky and nutty. The wine still finished a little short, but overall an attractive package.",,85,16.0,Piedmont,Langhe,,Arneis,Damilano

Springy, tasty and attractive, but not complicated.",Family Selection,88,14.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Luis Felipe Edwards
99468,US,"A peppery, minty flavor and acidic tartness dominate this bone-dry wine. It's silky and elegant in structure, with a good range of cherry, pomegranate, rhubarb and cola flavors that end in a swirl of Asian spices.",Goodin Vineyard,88,60.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
99469,New Zealand,"This wine offers easy drinkability at a fair price. It starts off with apple and melon scents, then folds in subtle toast and vanilla shadings, while the flavors of white peach and citrus make it versatile with food. Drink now and over the next couple of years.",Riverpoint Vineyard,88,16.0,Gisborne,,,Chardonnay,Millton
99470,Italy,"Cola, spice, marzipan, crushed black pepper and licorice—this delicious win has it all. It even offers a touch of smoked ham, warm tobacco and leather. It has a lively feel in the mouth thanks to bright acidity and warm cherry flavors.",,88,,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,La Sala
99471,France,"Aged in wood from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, this rich wine has sweetness, just enough tannins and wood to give structure, and a deep red cherry fruitiness.",Cuvée Tradition,88,,Beaujolais,Juliénas,,Gamay,Domaine de Gry-Sablon
99472,South Africa,"A great wine for a reasonable price, this Chardonnay offers a poised balance of bright fruit and toasty spice on the nose, and on the palate, is both assertive and integrated. A shot of minerality keeps the oaked spice and big fruit in check. The finish has finesse and length.",Barrel Fermented,88,16.0,Stellenbosch,,,Chardonnay,Jardin
99473,US,"There's a lot of crunchy acidity and stony minerality in this Chablis-style Chardonnay. It's got plenty of fruit along the lines of green apples, limes, melons and dates, and is interesting for its sleek architecture.",1470 Estate,88,35.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Foppoli
99474,US,"The great sweetness of this wine makes its success. It's just delicious, offering up a mouthful of chocolate-covered cherry candy flavors with the sharpness of cassis. Crisp acidity and fine, dusty tannins make it elegant.",Hames Valley Vineyard,88,36.0,California,Hames Valley,Central Coast,Port,Pessagno
99475,Portugal,"Deep, dusty wine, tannins dominating the fruit, giving a tough feel. There are some black currant flavors, but only just a hint. This definitely needs time to soften and broaden; give it 4–5 years.",Post Scriptum,88,27.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Prats & Symington LDA
99476,Chile,"The Grand Reserve blend, which is 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and lesser parts Carmenère and Petit Verdot, is clearly Simone's best wine. With the '06 vintage, plum and cassis aromas pick up purity with airing, and the palate shows nice raspberry, cassis and plum flavors. A focused wine that makes its mark.",Grand Reserve,88,18.0,Maule Valley,,,Cabernet Blend,Simone
99477,Italy,"Bursting fruit with layers of cherry, blueberry and forest berry, this wine is nicely framed by light tones of spice and roasted nut. This wine has all of its elements in place and offers food-friendly qualities such as refreshing acidity and a cleansing finish.",,88,,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Spadaio e Piecorto
99478,South Africa,"This is a wine with presence, from its meaty, spicy nose to its big, full-flavored fruit and spice character.

It lacks a touch of refinement, but is still a very good, ageable selection.",Estate,88,43.0,Stellenbosch,,,Red Blend,Rust en Vrede
99479,Australia,"Brisk and grapefruity, with perhaps some touches of ruby red or cherry as well. Despite the crispness, this is relatively easy to drink, because it also has a plump midpalate and friendly nature. A versatile seafood white.",,88,,Western Australia,Western Australia,,Riesling,Mad Fish

99485,US,"A good, strong, sturdy wine, filled with classic blackberry, black currant and cassis flavors. It's dry and rich, but the tannins are aggressive. They're edgy and tough and off-putting.

99486,New Zealand,"Mud House winemaker Nadine Worley has turned out an authoritatively flavored 2008 Pinot Noir, loaded with tart cherries and a hint of citrus zest.

Drink it over the next few years.",,88,19.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Mud House

99492,Italy,"Linear, tonic and packed tight with tertiary aromas of dried berry, licorice, cola, tar and drying mineral, this Chianti Classico Riserva seems older than it is. It's very elegant now, but drink it sooner rather than later.",Riserva,88,30.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Tenuta Villa Trasqua
99493,US,"Smells great, impressing with a burst of black pepper-inspired mashed ripe blackberries and grilled meat bone. Those notes follow up as you taste the wine, which is extraordinarily soft and velvety. The only problem is excessive sweetness that may partially be due to glycerine and high alcohol.

99494,New Zealand,"Reasonably priced for the quality, Waimea's 2008 Barrel Selection Pinot Noir is surprisingly rich and layered for the vintage, with savory notes of mushrooms, coffee and roasted meat backed by ample black cherry and plum fruit. Drink now–2015.",Barrel Selection,88,22.0,Nelson,,,Pinot Noir,Waimea

99498,Chile,"A bit hard and dark at first, yet despite rubbery, leathery aromas this evolves into a fine everyday Malbec.

99500,US,"Stainless steel fermented and aged Chardonnay (eg ‘naked') is becoming commonplace, but few offer as much snap and juicy fruitiness as this one.

A little fresh herb rounds out the finish.",Naked,88,11.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Ryan Patrick
99501,Italy,This is a lovely Chianti Classico that shows balanced aromas of cherry and raspberry that match up very nicely with the natural acidity you feel in the mouth.

99502,Israel,"An interesting grape typically produced in South Africa, this Pinotage is a pleasant alternative to more typical Israeli Kosher offerings. Menthol dominates the bouquet, with background notes of dark fruit and purple florals. Black berry, anise and coffee appear in the dark, velvety-textured mouth and linger through the long finish. Definitely worth a try, and will probably surprise you.",Reserve Kosher,88,25.0,Judean Hills,,,Pinotage,Barkan
99503,Chile,"An oak-dominated style of Chardonnay with soft white fruit aromas and a chunky texture. The body is full yet still fresh for a 2007, and the flavors of creamy apple, lemon and woodspice are nice. Oak is the lead agent and it carries over from nose to palate to finish. Drink now.",Grand Reserve Limited Edition,88,18.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Catrala
99504,France,"The aromas here are seriously woody, and that problem also appears on the palate. It has fruit, but the weight to balance is not there yet. This should develop over the next 4–5 years, but the wood is always going to be a major feature.",,88,25.0,Bordeaux,Haut-Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Caronne Ste Gemme

99506,Italy,Prugnolo Gentile (another name for Sangiovese) is blended with small percentages of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon to produce a firmly intense wine with black fruit aromas and spicy cardamom. There's a gritty quality to the tannins and overall texture.,,88,19.0,Tuscany,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,,Prugnolo Gentile,Canneto

Delicious, and is likely to develop quickly.",,88,,Bordeaux,Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château La Cardonne
99508,France,"A Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated wine, Lieujean is full, although showing some signs of austerity with tannins that are still very firm.

99510,Italy,"Peach blossom, pear, citrus and loads of honey make up the cheerful nose of this easy and approachable Pinot Grigio sold in a funky blue bottle. This is precisely the kind of no-fuss Italian white you'll want for informal occasions. It has deep honey-driven flavors and a flatter, broader mouthfeel that denotes slightly more structure than your run-of-the-mill Grigio.",,86,12.0,Northeastern Italy,Delle Venezie,,Pinot Grigio,Solemar
99511,US,"A little ungainly now, this Bordeaux-style blend is dominated by fierce tannins. Nothing has integrated yet. The oak sticks out over here, the very ripe black currant and cherry fruit over there. A potential problem is the sugary sweetness that causes imbalance. As this wine ages, something slight now may turn out to be huge later.",Elivette,86,90.0,California,Napa,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Spring Mountain Vineyard
99512,Italy,"Here's a fresher, more youthful approach to Tocai Friulano with crisp notes of exotic fruit, acacia flower and citrus.

99514,Australia,"This is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon (65%), with smaller amounts of Shiraz, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. The result is a black cherry- and cassis-scented wine that also shows plenty of cedar and tobacco character. Finishes with some crisp acids that impart an edgy character to the otherwise soft tannins.",Bells & Whistles,86,19.0,South Australia,Limestone Coast,,Red Blend,St Mary's
99515,Italy,"Opens with a pretty shade of gold that denotes more sophisticated extraction and in fact that impression is carried through to the nose and mouth where the wine exhibits ripe fruity aromas, honey, almond skin, dried herbs and natural rubber. The mouthfeel is thin, but remains a step above the commercial Pinot Grigio that is so commonly available. The wine is packaged with a real vine clipping around the bottle neck.",Pinot Grigio,86,15.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,Pinot Grigio,Mosolo Gleni
99516,New Zealand,"A rare disappointment from Saint Clair—and it's still a good wine, just not up the standards set by the winery's other reserve wines. Ripe, peachy fruit is not so much framed by oak as covered by it, starting and finishing with layers of buttered toast and vanilla.",Omaka Reserve,86,27.0,Marlborough,,,Chardonnay,Saint Clair
99517,Chile,"After years of taking its Merlot from southerly Lontué, San Pedro is now using Cachapoal fruit for this everyday wine, and the result seems fruitier and wider than in the past, with aromas of charcoal and herbs setting up black-fruit flavors accented by carob. A full and simple wine that has what it takes to please.",Castillo de Molina Reserva,86,12.0,Cachapoal Valley,,,Merlot,San Pedro

It's an easy wine to toss back with everyday fare.",,86,14.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Syrah,Domaine de la Terre Rouge
99521,US,"This is a pretty late release for such an inexpensive wine, but its hard, reductive shell may be the reason it's been held back for so long. Herbs and spices drift up from the glass, along with peppery raspberry fruit. But overall it's a tough nut to crack, and should be decanted well in advance.",,86,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Chateau Ste. Michelle
99522,US,"This is roughly 50-50 Cabernet and Merlot. The challenge for the Clore designate is to establish a specific personality apart from the winery's many other superpremium red blends. This seems like a rather ordinary wine. It's sound and good, but does not rise to a higher level.",Walter Clore Private Reserve Red Wine,86,44.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Columbia Crest
99523,US,"Except for some excessive sharpness in the finish, this is a lush, opulent young Cab. It shows ripe cassis, chocolate and oak flavors wrapped into firm, sweet tannins. That sharpness may limit ageability.",,86,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Maple Lane
99524,New Zealand,"At 13% alcohol, this dry-styled Riesling comes across as a bit chunky and lacking elegance. That said, it does offer plenty of poached apple, honey and spice aromas and flavors and a lingering finish.",Icon,86,22.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,House of Nobilo
99525,Chile,"Grassy and green-smelling, with hints of asparagus, green tobacco and sea air. This is true cool-climate white wine, and it shows its proximity to the ocean via aromas of green bean, asparagus and citrus. It's lean as can be, and tight as a drum. It's a terroir wine that has good freshness but could benefit from slightly more amplified fruit.",Reserva Especial,86,20.0,Limarí Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Maycas del Limari
99526,Argentina,"Plenty of smoky oak on the nose, which leads to a mildly lactic influence on the palate. Other than that minor flaw, the wine settles to show resiny black fruit, firm tannins and a finish of vanilla and mocha. Grabby and extracted, but like so many Argentine Malbecs from 2005, it lacks the exuberant flavors and cushioned body that has made the categeory what it is today.",Q,86,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Zuccardi

99528,Argentina,"With a hint of prune to the nose and some cheesy oak, the red flags go up. But in the mouth, the wine shows good berry and cassis flavors and admirable depth and length. Finishing notes of cassis and blackberry give it a good send-off. By no means exceptional but by all means a likable though slightly generic Cabernet.",,86,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pannotia Vineyards
99529,US,"Spann is building a decent track record with their Chardonnay-Viognier blend. The wine is very ripe and attractive in tropical fruit, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors, and while it's a little on the sweet side, the acidity pulls it back from the brink.",,86,20.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay-Viognier,Spann Vineyards
99530,Chile,"For the budget-minded, this Shiraz has ample spice, pepper, chocolate and fruit. It has a deepness and ripeness that's admirable, and while it's a standard wine that doesn't pick up complexities with airing, what's in the glass is more than satisfactory.",Reserve,86,9.0,Maipo Valley,,,Shiraz,Santa Alicia
99531,Chile,"Smooth on the nose, with some warmer-weather characteristics such as caramel, baked apple, pear and even acacia. The flavor profile includes ripe apple, melon and a bit of citrus, and the finish is sizable and healthy, with decent acidity and carry-over flavors of peach and melon. Good and not too heavy, especially for a Maipo Chardonnay.",Reserve,86,9.0,Maipo Valley,,,Chardonnay,Santa Alicia
99532,Hungary,"Spicy floral notes on the nose lead into crisp, light layers of citrus and pineapple on the palate with this flirty, flavorful white. Delicate with a clean and elegant finish, it's a fun summer wine with style.",Tramini Late Harvest,86,23.0,Hungary,,,Traminer,Bujdosó
99533,Argentina,"A well-oaked wine with some modern touches. It's ripe and ready but not overdone; the flavors are of raspberry and light resin, but not much else. Like many 2005s, this Cab shows a subdued personality and less-than-expressive fruit. It's good and inoffensive, but it doesn't make you take notice.",,86,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Felipe Rutini
99534,Chile,"Clean and lean, with lime-driven aromas leading into a tangy, crisp palate that settles on lemon-lime flavors.

99535,US,"Nicely rich and crisp, this fine Sauvignon Blanc shows smoky, creamy flavors of lemons, limes, green apples, peaches and figs. There's a slightly sweet, honeyed edge of vanilla, but the wine is basically dry.",,86,16.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Sauvignon Blanc,Easton
99536,Hungary,"The lively spice and pepper of Cabernet Franc take center stage in this approachable wine from Hungary, though the nose tends toward slightly green at first pass. On the palate, prominent pepper, sturdy tannins and a plucky wave of red fruit give the wine a kick. Pair with spiced meat or foods with a peppery profile for the best pairing experience.",Kúria Unfiltered,86,75.0,Villány,,,Cabernet Franc,Malatinszky
99537,Italy,"This Sagrantino di Montefalco from a hot vintage is on the ripe side with aromas of mature berry, black fruit, hickory, smoke and beef jerky.

99538,Chile,"Earth and bacon aromas meld into darker and fuller berry notes, while the medium-bodied palate shows solid but generic strawberry and raspberry flavors.

99544,US,"This is one of the darkest of Williams Selyem's new Pinots and also one of the ripest. It's jammy in the intensity of raspberry and cherry fruit, with a savory, Dr. Pepper cola richness. The spiciness, which is one of winemaker Bob Cabral's specialties in capturing, is exotic. It's a big, fat, rich wine that needs decanting now, and should age for 4–6 years.",Coastlands Vineyard,93,69.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
99545,Australia,"For this reviewer to not notice the alcohol in a wine that weighs in at 16.4% there have to be a lot of other things going on in the glass.

99548,US,"If you buy this 100% Cab, don't even think of drinking it now. Put it in the cellar and be patient. It has the soft tannins and herbal quality of a fine Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, but it's just not ready to drink now.

99550,US,"A beautiful Cabernet that gives a nod to Bordeaux in its earthy dryness and moderate alcohol. There are plenty of blackberries, cherries and currants, but also notes of violets, mushrooms and herbs that make it complex.

99760,US,"This limited-production bottling shows its cool-climate origins in the high acidity and barely-ripened flavors of cherries and rhubarb that have a slightly green, minty edge.

Clean and fresh on the finish.",Regional Collection,86,13.0,East Coast,,,Chardonnay,Nobilo
99812,Chile,"Size and color are not lacking in this robust, big-boned wine. The bouquet is defined by caramel and carob atop herbal berry aromas, while the palate is chewy, round and full of minty berry flavors.

99813,US,"The 16.2% alcohol shows in the Porty aroma and flavor of this unusually ripe Zin. It tastes of cayenne pepper, caramelized blackberry pie filling, milk chocolate and toasted meringue, and even with all that alcohol, it's still a little sweet.

99821,US,"Roughly three-fifths Merlot and two-fifths Cab Franc, this saw 19 months in mostly new French and American oak.

99825,US,"The pedigree of this Syrah is top-notch. The vineyard was planted by one of the owners of the fine Cabernet house, Surh Luchtel, and one of the winery's co-owners works at the von Strasser winery.

99827,Chile,"There's no shortage of heavily charred oak, and early on it may seem a bit mulchy and leathery.

99894,US,"A gorgeous 100% Cabernet, rich and mellow, with classic blackberry and cassis flavors. It's one of the winery's softer '09 Cabs, which may limit its ageability.

99897,US,"There's a toughness to this wine that makes it hard to appreciate now, but it will soften with some time in the cellar. Dry, silky and tannic, it features an enormous black-cherry flavor, with considerable oak overtones. It is an altogether impressive wine.

99898,US,"This is dry, rich, heady, spicy and utterly delicious. As usual, it contains a splash of Petite Sirah.

99916,Italy,"Black, dense and thickly concentrated, this modern Barbera d'Asti Superiore shows loads of wood influence in front of the fruit.

99983,US,"Pretty run of the mill, a tannic Cab with flavors of herbs and berries. Fulfills the basic requirements of dryness and full-bodied balance. Drink now.",Silver Label,84,20.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,B.R. Cohn
99984,US,"This five-vineyard blend of Chard has superripe, possibly botrytised, flavors of apricots and new oak. It's almost late-harvest in style, although it's fully dry. A disappointment.",Limited Selection,84,32.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Gainey
99985,US,"Soft and easy, with upfront cherry, raspberry, cola, chocolate and smoky oak flavors. The wine is tasty, but lacks the tannins and acids to give it structure.",Southern Exposure,84,35.0,California,Fair Play,Sierra Foothills,Syrah,C.G. di Arie
99986,Italy,"An odd black currant candy flavor totally dominated this wine both on the nose and palate. It seemed in balance, but the sweet cassis quality overwhelmed the wine.",,84,43.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Marchesi di Barolo
99987,Italy,"A pleasant wine showing some jammy fruit, with interesting nuances of burnt sugar. Already at its apogee, and probably should be drunk quickly.",Baric,84,13.0,Piedmont,Diano d'Alba,,Red Blend,Veglio
99988,US,"Pretty good for a ten buck red, this has proper varietal flavors of blackberries, cherries and oak, and is fullbodied and tannic. There's a rustic edge, but it will do fine with roast chicken or even macaroni and cheese.",,84,10.0,California,California,California Other,Cabernet Sauvignon,McManis
99989,Italy,"The Pio Cesare basic Barbera is a lean wine, with aromas of tart cherries and road tar. On the palate, the fruit and aromatics have melded together quite nicely, but despite a decent finish, the acidity is a little high.",,84,21.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Pio Cesare
99990,Italy,"Here's a big, modern and bold expression of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo that shows the delicious signs of quality fruit and sophisticated oak aging. This exciting wine is dark, lush and intense with rich flavors of chocolate, mature fruit and spice. The oak element is still a bit strong, so give it two or three more years of cellar aging.",Cagiòlo,91,,Central Italy,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,,Montepulciano,Cantina Tollo
99991,Chile,"As in previous years, this wine delivers earthy, proprietary aromas and flavors on a structured frame. The palate has forward berry and plum flavors, while the feel is rich, only mildly tannic and 100% healthy. Never does it sag, and with adequate acidity it doesn't lack for purpose or a finish line. Drinkable now into 2011.",Terrunyo Peumo Vineyard Block: 27,91,41.0,Peumo,,,Carmenère,Concha y Toro
99992,Italy,"Intense, penetrating and bold, this is the kind of tannic Umbrian wine you'll want to pair with polenta and beef stew or wild boar. Sagrantino di Montefalco is a naturally structured and hearty wine but this expression supplements the overall experience with delicate tones of Indian spice, black fruit and root beer. Drink after 2012.",,91,,Central Italy,Sagrantino di Montefalco,,Sagrantino,Antonelli
99993,US,"Very rich, very fine, this Pinot is a blend of Goldeneye's best vineyards. It shows a molten density, like liquid silver, lush in red cherries, licorice, cinnamon, coco, dried herb and orange zest flavors, and should develop in the bottle through 2012.",,91,55.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Goldeneye
