125011,Argentina,"Pungent aromas of tangerine and passionfruit get it going, so it's not shocking that the palate is zesty and citric, with flavors of passionfruit, lemon and orange.

125015,US,"As with the Indian Wells Cabernet, winemaker Bob Bertheau is using a considerable amount of Syrah (19%) to beef up the flavors.

125021,Argentina,"Begins with bold mint and prune aromas, and it's also sort of foxy and sweaty. The palate is better, with saucy, tart fruit that leans toward tomato, herbs and dry berry fruit.

125022,Argentina,"Generic berry aromas with a hint of tomato and bramble set this off as a different breed, which it is, considering it's 78% Tannat.

125025,France,"Moderately intense on the nose with dominating earthy, forest floor notes backed by red plum guts and cherry along with a hint of vanilla ice cream with raspberry sauce swirled in.

125031,US,"A good effort in the rough-and-ready genre. Aromas are straightforward plum shot through with earthy notes. The palate shows good cherry fruit and is quite gripping, with slightly rustic tannins that carry over to the short finish. Give it a year in the cellar to smooth out, then try with hearty beef dishes.",V. by Vivác Single Vineyard,85,22.0,New Mexico,New Mexico,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vivác Winery

125033,US,"Sweet and enticing, this is an easy-to-like wine made without obvious oak. Flavors run to plum and plum jam and though there are some stewed notes in the mouth, the overall fruit expression is quite honest. Try with roast pork.

125034,Argentina,"Big, bulky and granular, with high alcohol and saucy, raisiny aromas.

125035,US,"Very, very ripe in blackberries, currants and prunes, with oak elaborations. The flavors are rich, but the wine is a bit lacking in structure and depth of interest. Drink now.",Private Reserve,85,40.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Merlot,Château Julien
125036,US,"The blend includes 18% Syrah, which helps to emphasize the spice and sweet fruit flavors. But in the back, this is a stiff and fairly tannic wine, with a disconnect between the strawberry fruit and the slightly stemmy, herbal finish.",Indian Wells,85,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau Ste. Michelle
125037,Italy,Here's a fresh and floral wine with an easy disposition and vibrant aromas of citrus and spring flowers. The body is light and lean—as informal Pinot Grigio should be—and the wine ends with a zesty blast of acidity. We like this vintage much more than 2006.,,85,12.0,Northeastern Italy,Delle Venezie,,Pinot Grigio,Bivio
125038,Argentina,"Sweet berry and cherry aromas are fruity and a little heavy, while the palate is solid in feel and features flavors of sweet plum and berry fruit.

125039,Argentina,"Snappy red fruit aromas endow this Cab with approachability, while the palate is clean, tasty and a little lean, with spicy, piquant raspberry flavors.

125040,France,"The deep color and viscous, almost oily texture attest to the high level of concentration in this wine. Unusually, the nose is more mineral than fruit, while some cinnamon flavors peek through in the mouth. Soft acidity and high residual sugar suggest it should be consumed all by its lovely self.",Kessler Grand Cru,88,34.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Domaines Schlumberger
125041,US,"A deeply flavored, smooth Cabernet with the balance and elegance to drink with fine fare. It feels rich and plush, with aggressive tannins that frame ripe flavors of black cherries, red currants, cola, herbs and oak.

125042,France,"A fascinating nose, with grapefruit, kiwi, citrus, orange rind and hay that fold in to a peach/pear structure in the mouth.

125043,France,Luscious and weighty with good varietal character. Lychee and spiced pear dominate upfront while the flavorful palate exhibits honey and nutmeg. Notes of baked apple pie hang around for quite a while. The spiciness and slight sweetness call for a Thai curry dish.,Cuvée Marie,88,30.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Lucien Albrecht
125044,France,"A lively, impressively fresh Aligoté, packed with green and citrus fruits, bubbling with bright vivacity.",Vieilles Vignes,88,20.0,Burgundy,Bourgogne Aligoté,,Aligoté,Manuel Olivier

125046,Argentina,"A chunky, deep-fruited Malbec that is all about blackberry fruit. There's no funk or odd, floral, overcropped aromas here; instead, it's focused on roasted blackberry flavors, a natural herbal character, and coffee and mocha on the finish. Emphasizes size and friendliness.",,88,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Kaiken
125047,Chile,"A pricey Syrah by Chilean standards, but at least it's a good wine. The nose offers cookie, violet, wet clay and herbal olive notes along with black fruit aromas, while the palate is packed with sweet roasted berry and dark plum flavors. A bit minty and candied on the finish as the oak treatment rises up and demands to be noticed.",Limited Edition,88,30.0,Cachapoal Valley,,,Syrah,Lagar de Bezana

125050,Argentina,"Smoky and floral on the nose, and then thick and ripe in the mouth, with syrup to go with medicinal berry flavors. It's chewy and dense, with chocolate, cream and vanilla to the finish. A bit plodding, but its full weight, feel and depth of fruit push it along.",,88,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tomero
125051,Italy,"Here is an oak-aged Chardonnay with overtones of toast, vanilla and roasted almond that sit squarely besides well-integrated notes of exotic fruit, honey and apricot.

125053,Chile,"This could just as easily be labeled Cabernet because Cab is 90% of the blend. Regardless, it's a textbook version of a basic but likable Chilean Cabernet with currant and berry aromas. Ripe, composed and tasting of cassis and black cherry. Dry and clean on the finish, with all the basics in place.",Gran Devoción,88,15.0,Maule Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,Viña Maipo
125054,Chile,"Savory and a step up compared to the rest of Chile's under-$15 Malbecs. This wine has complexity and character; it smells a little like Syrah but in the mouth it's as full, cuddly and friendly as any Malbec from Argentina or elsewhere. Saturated, fruity and fun to drink, with a spot of heat and char on the finish.",Reserva,88,14.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Malbec,Viu Manent

125061,France,"Fashioned in the gutsy Ehrhart house style, this example does not disappoint, opening with intense Chinese spice and ground coriander which yield to cut apple and nutmeg flavors on the palate. It's off-dry in the mouth but a hit of acidity on the long lemon-honey finish leaves a refreshing impression. Serve with Malaysian food. Drink now to 2011.",Herrenweg,88,24.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Domaine Ehrhart

125072,Spain,"Starts out a little gaseous and sulfuric, but it picks up steam in the mouth, where flavors of apricot, citrus and tropical fruits perform a likeable dance.

125082,Spain,"Stylistically, this is at odds with what I feel Albariño should be.

Brims with pineapple tart filling, Key lime pie, orange zest, honeysuckle, daffodil and smoky, vanilla-oak flavors, with a creamy, yeasty richness. Would benefit from greater restraint and subtlety, which may come after 3–5 years in the bottle. If you drink it now, give it a good decanting.",La Masía Don Miguel Vineyard,90,37.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
125167,Argentina,"Very nice Malbec from vines with up to 80 years of age. The nose is briary, earthy and deep, with purity and power. And the palate is juicy, lively and packs enticing flavors of plum, blackberry, cured meat and vanilla. Warming, ripe stuff. Delicious and ready to drink.",Old Vine,90,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Martino
125168,US,"Delivers lots of bang for the buck. Shows real Chardonnay character, with rich vanilla cream-infused flavors of ripe pineapples, pears, sautéed bananas, buttered toast and honey. At this price, it's a fantastic buy that can stand next to Chards costing far more.",,90,13.0,California,California,California Other,Chardonnay,MooBuzz
125169,Italy,"Plenty of leather, rose and vanilla from toasty French oak make for a very pretty opening. The full-bodied palate shows exuberant cherry and boysenberry flavors wrapped in a refined tannin structure. A modern expression that can be enjoyed now or laid down to await more complexity.",,90,64.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Pio Cesare
125170,Italy,"Enchanting aromas of violets, perfume and mocha lead to a concentrated palate where muscular tannins provide a backdrop for cherry, raspberry and vanilla flavors. Raspberry and caramel flavors infuse the rich finish. Best after 2010.",Roncaglie,90,66.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Poderi Colla
125171,France,"A big wine, with its great floral perfumes dominating the dark tannins and dense texture. The berry fruit is part of this powerful expression of structure. Here the Négrette expresses its pure juicy and tannic character, leaving final very fresh acidity.",Optimum,90,21.0,Southwest France,Fronton,,Red Blend,Château Bellevue la Forêt
125172,Australia,"Although this is fortified, it's not overly so, with the finished alcohol level resting around 18%. The result is a decadently sweet mash-up of brandy-macerated raspberries that turn chocolaty on the finish. Although it lacks the complexity, tannic grip and minerality of the best true Ports, it's a tasty drop nonetheless. Drink now-2025.",The Vintage Fortified,90,40.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,D'Arenberg
125173,US,"Made in a drier, earthier style than most Oakville Cabs, this one emphasizes structure over fruity power. It's a sleek, elegant wine, brimming with tannins and acids that frame blackberry, currant, mineral and dried herb flavors, with a touch of raisins in the finish.",Reserve,90,45.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Emilio's Terrace
125174,US,"Shows real class and elegance for a Cab of this price. Ready to drink now, its richly tannic structure provides the framework for dry, complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, red currants, anise and herbs. Give it a few hours of decanting.",Crazy Creek Valley,90,20.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Katherine Goldschmidt
125175,Australia,"From an ancient vineyard, this full-bodied, slighly dusty-textured Shiraz boasts attractive scents of mixed berries, but also a slightly tarry note. Flavors run in a similar vein, adding in hints of espresso and vanilla, while the finish develops an ever so slightly gritty, bitter note. Hope that mellows with age and stow this away until 2014.",Attunga 1865,90,235.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Shiraz,Kilikanoon
125176,Spain,"Pine needle, cedar plank and forest floor define the mature nose, while the full, grabby, tannic palate is loaded with likable cola, black fruit and chocolate flavors. Ripe, pure, rich and tannic, with some bite, burn and ruggedness. Drinkable now but needs food to cut the tannins.",Prestigio,90,25.0,Northern Spain,Cigales,,Tempranillo,Val de Los Frailes
125177,Italy,"Impressive for its alluring nose with multiple layers of Indian spice, cherry fruit and leather.

125178,Italy,"Dark, dense and thoroughly modern with vibrant layers of boysenberry and black cherry fruit.

Very impressive.",Scarrone Vigna Vecchia,90,85.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Vietti
125179,Australia,"Water Wheel wines consistently deliver quality and value. The winery's 2007 Shiraz is made in a decadently supple, drink-now style with enough cocoa and mocha overtones to bring chocolate cake to mind. There's some cedar and spice complexity as well. Drink now-2013.",,90,18.0,Victoria,Bendigo,,Shiraz,Water Wheel
125180,US,"An interesting and very delicious Syrah that shows what Paso can do when it really tries. It's soft in acids, but rich and firm in tannins, offering ripe layers of blackberries, chocolate, violets, anise, cedar and tons of black pepper. Fine now, and should develop over the next 3–4 years.",Luna Matta Vineyard,90,25.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Syrah,Sinor-LaVallee
125181,Italy,This wine sets out to impress and hits its mark. Red raspberries and exotic spices make for an alluring opening while green herbs and grass notes vie with ripe strawberry and plum fruit on the palate. Sophisticated tannins give an edge to the mineral finish. Drink now to 2012.,,90,27.0,Piedmont,Dolcetto d'Alba,,Dolcetto,Sandrone

125183,Argentina,"Lagarde regularly makes consistent, true wines and this Cab is compact, solid and smooth, with spice and a lot of berry fruit on the nose. Refined, deep and pure on the palate, with blackberry, marzipan and licorice flavors. Very nice Argentine Cabernet for the money. Drink now into 2011.",Reserva,90,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lagarde
125184,Spain,"There's no denying the wine's power and intensity. It's concentrated like a cement block, with richness, plummy aromas, sweetness and char. But it's also candied and ultrarich in the mouth, with syrupy flavors of berry extract, cola and chocolate. A heavy wine that shows every ounce of its 15.5% alcohol. Ultimately it's more sweet and powerful than it is precise. Drink now through 2013.",,90,142.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Cabernet Blend,El Nido
125185,Spain,"This wine gets it right. The color is dark and opaque, while the nose offers perfume, Middle Eastern spice, fruitcake and solid black fruit. Enticing in the mouth, where full black fruit flavors are pumped up by fine herb and spice notes. And then coffee and chocolate fill the finish. Drink now through 2010.",Jaros,90,35.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Finca El Quiñón
125186,France,"Dominated by Merlot, but with sizable chunks of other Bordeaux grapes, this is finely polished, wood-aged wine. It has perfumed spice and dry tannins from the wood. The fruit balances well, showing wild blackberry and licorice. Age for 2–3 years.",,90,21.0,Southwest France,Côtes de Bergerac,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château les Tours des Verdots
125187,US,"A classy Pinot Noir that shows the attributes of its vintage and origin. The grapes come from the cooler, southern part of Russian River Valley, and the wine displays brisk acidity and complex flavors of cherries, pomegranates and cola. It's young now, but dry and elegant, and should develop bottle complexity through 2013.",,90,35.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Chronicle

125189,Italy,"With 70 hectares of vines and many generations of family management, Piazzo Armando is a steady and consistent producer of Barolo and other traditional wines of the Langhe.

125192,Chile,"Tight at first, with aromas of olive, brick dust, cured cheese and dark fruit. The palate on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère (15%) is narrow but healthy. There's a tough juiciness to it, and eventually it reveals black plum and cherry flavors along with a chocolaty finish that holds its pose until the cameras are off.",Antu Mountain Vineyard,89,20.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère,Ninquén

125194,US,"Though it is a mix of eight different varietals from as many vineyards, this wine does not lose focus. It transcends the kitchen sink/field blend genre by virtue of its polish and definition. Bright red fruits mingle with light spice and sweet tannins. This is a good all-purpose bottle of fruit-driven red for near-term enjoyment.",Washington State Cuvée,89,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Walla Walla Vintners
125195,Italy,"This vintage of Tenuta di Trinoro's renowned super Tuscan (mostly Merlot with some Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Canernet Sauvignon) is a tad too ripe and mature to score higher. Bold notes of strawberry and blackberry preserves rob the wine of some of its inherent elegance and add a chewy, sticky element to its mouthfeel. Otherwise, you'll get bold tones of tobacco, leather and spice.",,89,120.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Tenuta di Trinoro
125196,Italy,"The wine boasts measured intensity and pretty, delicate aromas of small berry fruit, pomegranate juice, balsam notes, spice, black fruit and a hint of licorice.

125197,US,"Tannic and bruising, this is a smoky, hearty, concentrated red blend of 44% Merlot, 32% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Cab Franc and 3% Petit Verdot.

125201,US,"A fair amount of this is old vine (1972) Cabernet from Bacchus and Dionysus; it's 100% pure varietal.

125203,US,"Here is another fine effort from Columbia Crest that captures some spice and keeps the fruit bright and fresh.

125207,New Zealand,"A dark and brooding style that's atypical for Marlborough Pinot Noir, with earthy aromas hinting at mushroom give way to modest cherry fruit on the palate. This is full-bodied, ending with firm tannins and acids, so give it a few years for the fruit to emerge.",La Strada,89,30.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Fromm Winery
125208,Italy,"Vibrant cherry and blueberry fruit is backed by sweet spice and thick extraction. The wine has a penetrating, brooding character and delivers many layers of spice, especially in the mouth.

125209,New Zealand,"This is an attractively ripe Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, with bold aromas and flavors of gooseberries and nectarine, rounded out even further by touches of fig.

125210,New Zealand,"Grove Mill usually does well with its Riesling, and the 2006 is a refreshingly light-bodied wine with a long, tart, mouthwatering finish that nicely balances its residual sugar.

125211,Australia,"The Reserve wines from Jacob's Creek continue to offer excellent value, and with 90,000 cases imported, this should be easy to find.

125212,US,"The Morrison Lane Vineyard Syrah is one of the highlights of the lineup from K Vintners, but has not previously been made by Walla Walla Vintners.

125213,US,"Adelaida is assembling a good track record with this wine. It's from the cooler western portion of the appellation, so that crisp acidity provides a fine framework for the slightly sweet tropical fruit, wildflower and spice flavors. With its exotic personality, it's best paired with strongly flavored, complex dishes that combine poultry, game or shellfish with fruits, nuts and honey.",The Glenrose Vineyard,89,30.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Viognier,Adelaida
125214,US,"The Métier White is a sleek, assertive and racy white wine that does not fall into the flavor ranks of most Washington Viognier, though that is 90% of the blend. The rest is Roussanne, which adds notes of Meyer lemon. The wine is clean and crisp, well-defined with flavors of citrus and green herb. It is built upon vibrant acids rather than barrel flavors, and in a blind tasting it might pass for a somewhat salty (rather than peppery) Grüner Veltliner.",Métier White,89,32.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,White Blend,Doyenne
125215,Austria,"A rich wine, touched by tropical fruit, pepper and light acidity. Although there is crispness, this wine is more about roundness, allied with weight, but finishing with fresh spiced pear flavors.",Ried Kreutles Smaragd,89,40.0,Wachau,,,Grüner Veltliner,Emmerich Knoll
125216,Italy,"Sticky prune, plum and black fruit appear on the nose of this ripe, luscious Sangiovese and Cabernet blend.

Drink it with ribs or grilled steak.",Vino in Musica,89,50.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Fattoria di Valiano
125217,Italy,"This Merlot from Umbria delivers notes of mature fruit, black plum, ripe cherry and toasted vanilla lavished over its entirety.

125221,Italy,"The evident presence of toasted oak tilts this ruby-colored Brunello slightly off balance. You'll recognize aromas of espresso, Indian spice, leather, tobacco and vanilla: There's not much in the way of fruit and the wine probably won't age for long. Drink now.",,85,,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Tenuta di Sesta

125223,Argentina,"Clean and well made, but underwhelming. There's basic blueberry and blackberry flavors riding on a medium-bodied palate, but overall the wine is more generic than specific. It's easygoing and causes no red flags to go up, however at the end of the day it doesn't show much personality.",Trumpeter,85,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rutini
125224,Bulgaria,"Made from the Thracian Valley's indigenous Mavrud grape, this wine has an enticing aroma of leather, blackberry and tobacco. The flavor is savory and spicy—rich with tobacco. Moderately complex with aging potential. Pair with rich, savory meat dishes.",Salta Terra,85,9.0,Thracian Valley,,,Mavrud,Pulden
125225,Italy,"This is a lower range, more affordable Friulano from the Volpe Pasini team: The wine delivers aromas of fresh fruit, peach and white flower and has a tight, firm feel in the mouth, ending on a bright, fresh note.",,85,17.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,Friulano,Volpe Pasini
125226,US,"This is 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot and 20% Syrah—a classic Washington blend. Here it gives some lift to the nose, and adds the tart and tangy berry flavors of Syrah to the broad flavors of cherry and herb coming from the Bordeaux grapes. The oak influence is clearly felt in the toast and mocha-infused finish, but there is a flat ending that sort of spoils the party. The acids are there, but somehow they fail to lift the wine to the next level.",El Buho Red Wine,85,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Tildio
125227,France,"For a Petit-Chablis, this has plenty of firm, tight structure. While the fruit is light, it is based on a texture of sweet caramel and plums, freshened with acidity. The finish is rich and soft.",,85,33.0,Burgundy,Petit Chablis,,Chardonnay,Domaine Pommier
125228,France,"Tight green apple and citrus acidity dominates this wine. It is very crisp, at this stage too crisp, and the structure is on the lean side. It certainly reflects the cool growing conditions of 2007.",Côte de Léchet Premier Cru,85,47.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Domaine Pommier

125233,Lebanon,"Plum, red berry, cinnamon and mint aromas give this savory-style red from Lebanon a serious start. Soft and elegant on the palate but with a touch of spice and lively acid, the wine is balanced and unfolding, and will pair well with dishes that offer complex spice. An interesting red with exotic appeal.",Gaston Hochar,85,50.0,Bekaa Valley,,,Red Blend,Château Musar

125236,Chile,"Comfortable enough, with common aromas of black fruit, spice, earth and leather. Given that production on this wine is now a whopping million cases, anything palatable should be considered a success. Casillero has reasonably good plum, cassis and brambly flavors, with a hint of oak in support. The mouthfeel is narrow, but overall the wine tastes real.",Casillero del Diablo Reserve,85,12.0,Central Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Concha y Toro
125237,New Zealand,"This wine doesn't show the ripeness of Barker's Marque's other SBs, instead offering hard nectarine and underripe melon flavors accented by a grassy, herbal finish. It's still good, probably at its best served alongside simple fish dishes.",ranga.ranga,85,11.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Barker's Marque
125238,Italy,"Benefizium Porer comes off as a very easy- drinking Pinot Grigio for a stress-free summertime afternoon.

125239,France,"Light and crisp, this is a fresh style of wine without much weight. There are a toast element from wood, some green berry structure, flavors of white currants, and tight acidity. The finish shows citrus and high toast. Screwcap.",,85,35.0,Burgundy,Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits,,Chardonnay,Bertrand Ambroise
125240,Greece,"This fumé wine has warming aromas of vanilla, almond and allspice and aromatic flowers.

125242,US,"Reductive, with strong rubber ball scents; lying just below are raspberry and the classic Champoux cherry fruit. There is a thinness that seems to emphasize the high tones, the volatility and the alcohol; the fruit lacks flesh. Maybe with more airing/decanting this would fill out.

125247,Chile,"Fairly generic on the nose, with a floral accent. The mouthfeel is tannic and hard, thus the name Toro de Piedra (Bull of Stone) is appropriate. Rubbery, dark and baked flavors of blackberry and chocolate give this a masculine personality, and the finish is pure nails. This may be one to hold for another year; maybe the tannins will soften.",Toro de Piedra Reserva,85,15.0,Curicó Valley,,,Carmenère-Cabernet Sauvignon,Viña Requingua
125248,Chile,"More or less clean and neutral on the nose, with aromatic notes of peach and apple. The palate is juicy but sort of jumpy, with flavors of orange, pithy bitterness and roast corn. Good in this price range but seemingly on its way to being past its prime.",Viejo Feo,85,11.0,Maule Valley,,,Chardonnay,Viña Tinajas
125249,Chile,"Clumsy out of the starting blocks, with creamy chocolate aromas, leather and leafiness. The palate is solid and concentrated, but short on elegance and depth of flavor. What's here is blocky and chunky, but also sort of green and flaky. Decent but with some issues, and just good on its best day.

125256,France,"This is an exceptional wine, as is the vintage. The fruits—grapefruit, crisp red apple—balance with a fine yeasty character. There is a great depth of flavor, the fruits going in a pure line of freshness. The one problem is that it is much too young, the result of the demand from the market for the next vintage. Age this wine for at least four years.",Cristal Brut,98,289.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Louis Roederer
125257,France,"Even at 10 years, this is still just setting out. While it doesn't have the immensity of the 1996, it has a great intense grapefruit, pear and fresh apricot series of flavors that come through with toast, ripeness and a suggestion of almonds. 7–8 years aging.",Cuvée Sir Winston Churchill Brut,97,275.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Pol Roger
125258,US,"A fantastic Cabernet that stuns now for authenticity and power, and should develop for many years. Despite the large production, lower than that of many first growth Bordeaux, the wine, which has tiny amounts of Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, shows classic Oakville elegance and precision. Rich in black currants, blackberries, cherries and dark chocolate, it should hit its stride from 2011 through 2017.",Estate Bottled,96,125.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Far Niente
125259,France,"With this vintage, there are signs of a wine that is maturing fast. That's the initial impression. But at the same time, there are wonderful dry fruits, minerality and sweet hazelnuts, all finely in balance. The layers get more complex, bringing in toast as well as acidity. Almost ready, but worth aging.",La Grande Année Brut,96,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Bollinger
125260,US,"Only a Burgundian ideologue would find anything not to like about this mouth-filling Pinot that captures the essence of Santa Rita Hills. It's as voluptuous as any Pinot in California, offering waves of ripe, fleshy cherries, red currants, licorice and smoky vanilla that just don't stop in palate appeal. For all that, the wine is elegant, silky and refined. Delicious now, although a little tannic, and will benefit from decanting and aging. Bring on the steak.",Ten,96,80.0,California,Sta.

125261,US,"Still young, chewy and textural, this stands as a classic Washington 2005 red—lusciously laden with mixed red and black berries, generous and deep; dense and jammy. The mixed berries, red licorice, cherries, layers of butterscotch, toffee and caramel are beautifully integrated and linger seductively into the finish. It has some initial alcoholic heat, but the flavors compensate and go on and on. This is a wine that must be cellared another five or more years before it even begins to pull itself together. If you must pop the cork before then, decant it for at least six hours and more if possible before drinking.",,96,115.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Quilceda Creek
125262,US,"This is a stunningly powerful 100% Cabernet, rich in fruit and well-oaked, that shows the authority of Oakville in a great vintage.

125263,France,"The fabled Salon's latest release is much riper and softer than the great steely 1996 vintage. This suggests it is likely to be ready to drink soon. In the meantime, the acidity is supremely fresh, with grapefruit edges and green apple flavors.

125264,US,"This bright, aromatic, vivid wine opens with a bowlful of berries and cherries. There is plenty of acid under the ripe fruit, which takes center stage at the moment.

Despite its youth, the flavors persist for a remarkably long finish.",,96,65.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Leonetti Cellar
125265,US,"The Cabernet is sharply defined, with interesting citrus flavors defining the borders of the fruit. Lemon peel, candied pineapple and even grapefruit add lovely grace notes indicative of rich, clean, natural acids and a wine with plenty of glycerin. The stunning red fruits are polished and backed with details such as dried herb, and a tiny hint of mint.

125266,US,"Etude's Heirloom bottling is vintage-driven, and the 2005 is a great wine. It's a powerhouse that in its youth is full-bodied and almost heavy. It shows massive flavors of red currants, cherry pie filling, cola, figs and spices that taste like they were baked into a dessert pastry, except that the finish is thoroughly dry. What's hard to communicate is the wine's dazzling structure. Not meant to be opened now, it's a Pinot Noir to store through 2010, as it husbands its strength and gains bottle complexity.",Heirloom,96,90.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Etude
125267,France,"With its aromas of very pure, crisp fruits, this ripe wine from the great 2002 vintage is so complete. It has flavors of dried fruits, apricots and pear, and a texture that fills the mouth with a tight, mineral character. Impressive now, it does need to age, or even be decanted before serving.",Brut Millésimé,95,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Taittinger
125268,France,"Orange-pink in color, this a super-rich rosé. The flavors are of orange zest, citrus and red currants, with a beautiful contrast of hazelnuts.

125269,France,"The purity of this wine is impressive. It has a straight line of mineral, flint and grapefruit running through it. Around this, there are layers of fresh apples, lime zest and a tight, taut structure. The one downside to what is a fine wine is that it, like many Roederer vintages, is too young. Give it 4–5 years.",Blanc de Blancs Brut,95,70.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Louis Roederer
125270,France,"With a majority of Chardonnay in the blend, this has turned into a wonderfully expressive wine. It is more open than the great 1996, more generous, giving some mature toast and nut flavors, but still retaining ripe apricots and mulberry.

125271,US,"This is the grandest of Melville's current trio of '06s. It's also the most ageworthy. Fifty percent stem inclusion in the fermentation has given the wine a tannic, gritty earthiness and spiciness that throw a cloak over the underlying wine. But what a fantastic wine that is, loaded with oodles of cherries, currants and violets.

125272,France,"Possibly the most famous Blanc de Blancs, this continues to be a yardstick.

This is a classic.",Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs Brut,95,,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Taittinger
125273,US,"The first sniff and taste tell you this is an important wine, but also a very young, tannic one. It's the structure, and not just the ripe flavors, that's so impeccable, giving the wine its backbone and strength. But speaking of flavors, the wine is gigantic in black currants and blackberries.

125274,France,"This is a classic Dom Pérignon vintage. It's big and fruity initially, a mouthful of ripeness. Then the texture and structure of this dense wine come through. It's as much wine as Champagne, rich, the apple and fresh pear flavors vying with yeasty and a tense crispness. Worth aging, it will be even better in 3–4 years.",Dom Pérignon Brut,95,150.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Moët & Chandon
125275,France,"This Krug vintage is showing some maturity, especially from its toast aroma. But certainly not too much maturity, because on the palate the fruit remains young at heart, a crisp burst of freshness coming through the more mature acidity.

125277,US,"An awesome Syrah that proves that, while size isn't everything, it does matter. A major league wine, brilliantly packed with currant, black cherry, licorice and pepper flavors whose power is hard to exaggerate.

The acidity of Champagne and that lift in the mouth show its true origins.",Rare Vintage Brut,95,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin
125279,France,"Resplendent in its new shiny gold label, Krug is a majestic Champagne. Its velvet texture, dominated by mature flavors, is toasty and rich, dense and complex.

125419,US,"This newest version of the vineyard's signature block of Syrah has more forward, sweet fruit than any before; and it also brings pretty chocolate-wrapped tannins into the picture.

125506,US,"The grapes sure got ripe even in this cool, balanced vintage, so that the wine is jammy in cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors.

125509,US,"Here's a fine young Sauvignon Blanc that shows plenty of crisp sophistication.

125540,US,"From Stillwater Creek vineyard, this 80/20 blend of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon simply tastes young. The fruit is ripe enough, but superficial, with a lot of barrel flavors providing the weight and filling in with smoke, toast and coffee.

125545,US,"Pondera's Sericus blend is based upon Merlot (60%) with Cabernet Sauvignon (30%) and Cab Franc (10%) filling it out.

125550,US,"There's a lot going on in this complex Chardonnay. The balance strikes you first, with crisp, zesty acidity cleansing the palate and preparing it for the onslaught of flavor.

125551,US,"The minerality in this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon has an iodine/oyster shell finish that is quite unique. The fruit smacks of cassis and a bit of boysenberry; the 80% new oak is barely evident. It's got the typical potpourri mix of flower and herb, not just the scents but also in the flavors. The flavors just hang in there remarkably well; this takes cassis and black olive and smoke and tar and mixes them into a tight, compact, layered and lengthy Cabernet.",The Widowmaker En Chamberlin Vineyard,95,,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cayuse
125552,France,"This single-vineyard Champagne is always at the summit in Champagne. The 1998 is just at the moment when the fresh fruits move into maturity.

125554,US,"A polished, elegant and delicious Pinot. New, smoky oak frames ripe, jammy blackberry, cherry, black raspberry and orange flavors, with richer notes of chocolate, figs and grilled meat.

125557,US,"Merryvale's Profile remains a star year after year. The '04 is nearly all Cabernet Sauvignon, and stuns with its power.

125560,US,"Whether by virtue of vintage or bottle variation, Boudreaux wines seem to gyrate a bit wildly when first released. This new 2005 is no exception. At first sniff it explodes into life, the aromas a mix of herb, spice, tar, smoke, earth and fruit. Flavors are threaded together into a seamless, saturated whole—plum, cassis and cherry liqueur up front, earth and tannin right behind.

125564,US,"Yes, even for a California Pinot, this is a big, strong, full-bodied wine. Southing always is. It could almost morph into a Cabernet Sauvignon. But who cares? It's compellingly delicious, and isn't that what wine is all about? Flavorwise, it tastes of cherries, oranges, red currants, violets, raspberries, cedar and peppery spices, with 65% new oak.

125582,Austria,"One of the light, fresh and fun Grüners being made by many producers in the Kamptal. This is crisp, with a slight spritz, Austria's answer to dry Vinho Verde, all green apples and fresh citrus.",Trinkvergnügen No 6,87,18.0,Niederösterreich,,,Grüner Veltliner,Hirsch
125583,Austria,"A big, ripe wine, full of berry fruits and rhubarb, edged with tannins, spice and red plum skins. It has a juicy, rich quality, enhanced by acidity, and rounded with vanilla. Keep for a year. Screwcap.",,87,16.0,Burgenland,,,Blaufränkisch,Gunter Triebaumer
125584,Germany,"Rather minerally upfront, with stony scents verging on flinty alongside some floral and citrus notes. It's light in weight but on the sweet side, with slightly confected strawberry flavors giving it an almost candied quality. Aging it 5–8 years should lessen the impact of the sugar.",Trittenheimer Apotheke Spätlese,87,33.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Josef Rosch
125585,Italy,"Light as a feather and delicately fragrant, this luminous Prosecco Extra Dry is buoyant and tonic and maintains its fresh fruit sweetness throughout. Those fresh fruit flavors are framed by pretty mineral nuances that give the wine drive and length.",Extra Dry,87,,Veneto,Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene,,Prosecco,Vettori
125586,Italy,This cheerful Prosecco delivers pretty floral tones and delicate peach intensity.

125587,Spain,"A little rough around the edges, i.e. there's a sharp note to the nose and then lots of barrel char to back that up. There's black fruit, pepper and lots of oak on the palate, which has a full feel and then firm, clamping tannins.",Lanzaga,87,30.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
125588,US,"Merlot has long been Waterbrook's strong suit, and this offers the expected seamless blend of cherry/berry fruit, softly polished tannins and toasty barrel flavors. What are missing—at least for the moment—are the grace notes. Give it plenty of breathing time and you begin to detect traces of spice and earth, finishing with a lick of chocolate.",Reserve,87,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Waterbrook
125589,Austria,"Spicy wine, with its soft red stone fruits and bright tannins. There is a certain layer of dryness, and the acidity is fresh and gleaming. Being a Klassik style, there is a minimum of wood aging, and the wine just speaks of the fruit. Glass stopper.",Blauer Klassik,87,17.0,Südoststeiermark,,,Zweigelt,Winkler-Hermaden
125590,Australia,"At 14.5% alcohol, this wine is full-bodied, but comes across as slightly coarse-textured in the mouth, where hints of mint and pepper join bold flavors of plum and vanilla. The overall impression is one of power and intensity rather than balance.",,87,18.0,Western Australia,Western Australia,,Shiraz,Xanadu
125591,Italy,"There's a soapy, candle wax quality to this Prosecco Dry that distinguishes it from the rest and that is backed by pulpy peach and fresh fruit. The wine is lean and compact in the mouth but has a fresh and tonic finish.",Zeta Dry,87,22.0,Veneto,Prosecco di Conegliano,,Prosecco,Zardetto
125592,Argentina,"Bright fruit, mildly creamy, with good zest and acidity. Shows a sweet, savory center with hints of brown sugar and spice sitting along the edges. Easy tannins make it a friendly style; good for near-term drinking. No cellaring necessary.",,87,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tomero
125593,Greece,"Agiorgitiko, famed in Nemea and popular for its soft, fragrant red berry character, is represented well in this balanced, flavorful wine. A nose of wooded spice, pepper and Mediterranean herbs is followed by waves of soft tannis, red fruit, spice and a touch of smoke. Pair with steak or a meat stew.",Réserve,87,16.0,Nemea,,,Agiorgitiko,Tsantali
125594,US,"This is forward and a bit fat, with softly laid-in fruit flavors of pear, melon and white peach, set against generous, buttery oak. The 2005 seems to have had more acid and weight; this is a lighter, softer vintage, but the wine has been made in the same general style. It's ready to be enjoyed right now.",,87,19.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Three Rivers
125595,Italy,"Here is a luminous single-vineyard bubbly with steady and persistent perlage and pristine aromas of acacia flower, orange zest and peach.

125596,Italy,"Peaches and flowers set the tone and offer a pretty balance of freshness and flavor. The wine has bright acidity with lingering minerals and a creamy, foamy finish.

125598,US,"Full-bodied, ripe and round, this tangy Merlot is swathed in liquorous barrel flavors. It needs decanting to smooth out the alcoholic burn, and let the fruit emerge from the lumber yard. But it's fine tasting, with a rich chocolaty finish, designed to please those who enjoy a California style red.",,87,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Lost River
125599,France,"This light, fresh wine, with its concentration on raspberry flavors, has lifted acidity and an edge of bitterness. The tannins are there, but relatively subdued, so it's likely to age quickly.",,87,60.0,Burgundy,Morey-Saint-Denis,,Pinot Noir,Louis Latour
125600,US,"Dry, silky and tannic, this Pinot shows forward cherry, red currant, cola and cinnamon-nutmeg flavors. It's a good example of a drink-me-now wine with some real complexity and class.",Reserve,87,30.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kenwood

125602,US,"This is a very nicely rendered Wahluke Slope AVA Syrah, with spicy currant and raspberry fruit underscored with the characteristic lightly citrusy acids. There's a hint of pineapple which resonates just beneath the surface. The wine gathers some strength in the back, adding weight and flavors of plum, cherry and chocolate.",Clifton Vineyard,87,28.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Camaraderie
125603,Italy,"The nose on this Prosecco is very dry and mineral-driven although you do get some fruit tones and dried flowers at the back. The wine has a more linear, less fruity approach and ends with a nutty almond note.",Extra Dry,87,17.0,Veneto,Prosecco di Conegliano,,Prosecco,Canella
125604,Spain,"Watermelon, cantaloupe and peach aromas are just as they should be, while the palate is whole, fresh and full of tangerine and nectarine.

125606,Australia,"This wine boasts admirable complexity, but comes across as a bit angular, with the acids maybe a touch too prominent. Still, the flavors of mint, pepper and meat layered over plum and raspberry fruit offer a lot to like, and the acids may actually make this wine more versatile with food than many more unctuous Shiraz.",Old Vine,87,19.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Shiraz,Fire Block

125608,Spain,"Coconut and wintergreen aromas announce new oak, and as it opens this somewhat muscular Rioja unveils butter and charred scents.

125609,Greece,"This is an exuberant but elegant Agiorgitiko, with its big berry nose and pretty, rounded fruit flavors.

A balanced but distinctive red.",Agiortiko Abaton,87,30.0,Halkidiki,,,Red Blend,Tsantali

125615,US,"This is a big, gutsy, muscular Merlot marked by hard, dry tannins. That doesn't mean it's not rich.

125618,US,"Opens with straightforward aromas of strawberry and cotton candy, giving way to peach and apple on the (slightly watery) palate.

125622,Argentina,"Good for Argentine Chard but not worth the price. It starts with mellow peach and apricot aromas, which are followed by melon, papaya and banana flavors.

125627,US,"Nebbiolo has proved to be an enormously difficult grape to grow outside of a few small areas in Northern Italy, but Three Fox Vineyards has done an admirable job. There's pleasant strawberry fruit here with an earthy underpinning of fresh tar. In the mouth, Nebbiolo's trademark grippy tannins proved a backdrop for intense, cherry fruit. Give the tannins a few years to mellow out, then serve with London broil.",Piemontese,85,30.0,Virginia,Virginia,,Nebbiolo,Three Fox
125628,US,"Forward and flavorful, this brings together five different grapes from eight different vineyards, though it is mostly (70%) Wahluke Slope Cabernet Sauvignon.

125629,US,"This wine has a very direct appeal, with blueberry and boysenberry fruit, shot through with notes of earth and mushroom. The palate is juicy, smooth and reasonably crisp.

125633,US,"Hogue's Late Harvest Riesling is an odd duck. In most usage, late harvest indicates a dessert-style wine with considerable sweetness.

125635,Chile,"Heavily roasted at first, and then comes a distinct wave of root beer, olive and barbecue sauce.

125644,France,"A blend across the Mercurey appellation, this is a well-structured wine, offering both a solid core of dry tannins and dark plum and fresh juice flavors.

125721,US,"Give this young Zin some time in the bottle. It's too jammy and thick to show its best now.

125763,France,"A rich, juicy, super-ripe wine, the fruit a powerhouse of dark flavors. In this welter of fruit, the tannin is just a sideshow, while the acidity brings a layer of freshness to the smoky character. It is still young, and needs 2–3 years.",La Perdrix,89,10.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Clos Troteligotte
125764,Australia,"The 2006 Art Series Shiraz isn't a powerful, intensely concentrated wine, but a pretty, elegant rendition of Shiraz.

Very nice wine.",Crianza,89,27.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto Fino,Legaris
125767,Italy,"A serious contender with sophisticated notes of leather, barnyard and cedar wrapped up in toasty vanilla oak. A hint of char adds an edge to a streamlined palate infused with earth, mushroom and strawberry tones. A slight lack of persistence takes it out of the top flight.

125770,Australia,"Like Spinal Tap, this wine turns the volume up to 11, packing in enough blueberry jam for breakfast on the Queen Mary II and enough cedary oak to build 100 saunas.

125776,Australia,"De Bortoli winemaker Stephen Webber operates on a somewhat contrarian level, so this is not a soft cuddly Shiraz-Viognier loaded with apricot notes. Instead, it features savory, meaty aromas lifted by peppery elements and black olive, espresso and tart plum flavors. It's medium-bodied, firmly structured, and should age through at least 2020.",Estate Grown,89,36.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,Shiraz-Viognier,De Bortoli
125777,US,"A really nice, dry wine that stimulates the mouth with crisp acidity, then offers waves of interesting, complex flavors.

125781,Italy,"The heat-laden 2003 vintage has given this wine a more approachable acid and tannin structure than your average Barolo, but also a quirky collection of aromas, including tomato skin, fresh kindling and fried green tomatoes.

125789,Argentina,"Round and saturated on the nose, with a baked, syrupy set of dark-fruit aromas.

125794,US,"It's so easy to get a big Zin wrong, especially in a hot vintage like 2004, but Taft Street does a good juggling act with this single-vineyard Zin, made from century-old vines. The wine flirts with excessive sweetness, but pulls back at the last second, so that the blackberry, cherry and mocha flavors are essentially dry.

125795,US,"This affordable blend of all five Bordeaux grapes is a solid second wine, produced from barrels cut from the winery's other bottlings.

125796,US,"From one of the westernmost vineyards in the county, just a few miles from the chilly Pacific, comes this dark, intense Pinot. Tasted in 2007, it was too tightly wound and too young to appreciate fully, with grapy, primary fruit flavors of blackberries, cherries and cola. It should be mellower now, however.",Solomon Hills,88,45.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Ojai
125797,New Zealand,"This ample-bodied wine boasts appealing buttered apple and citrus flavors to go with subtle touches of cinnamon and clove.

125803,Chile,"Quite Bordeaux in style, meaning the wine is leaner, tighter and more tannic than typical Southern Hemisphere blends usually amount to. But we very much like the wine's mineral, plum and juicy raspberry flavors. All in all, expect a sturdy, well-made wine with plenty of natural and barrel-aided tannins. Will likely improve with another year or two in bottle.",Los Vascos Reserve,88,21.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Red Blend,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite)

125806,Italy,"Trescone (Sangiovese, Ciliegiolo and Merlot) has a more musky and earthy personality with dark fruits, plums, prunes, red beets and a touch of crushed white peppercorn.

125808,US,"Botrytis infected the grapes, but the winemaker has vinified this unique wine totally dry, so you get pure Chard and botrytis taste without the sweetness.

125809,US,"Pure Cabernet Sauvignon from Pepper Bridge and Seven Hills goes into this elegant, crisp and nicely balanced wine. It's quite a change from the winery's 2004, which used different vineyard sources and (seemingly) a different mix of barrels. This shows varietal fruit—red currant, cherry and plum—and details of leaf and herb.

125812,US,"Despite nearly 16% alcohol, this wine manages not to taste hot. The fruit is so powerful, and the tannins so smooth, that it gives a balanced and harmonious mouthfeel.

125814,New Zealand,"For all of this wine's 14.5% alcohol, it's not that rich, instead presenting a medium-bodied, elegant palate feel.

Tasted twice, with consistent results.",Zone 2,88,60.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Syrah,Te Awa
125815,Chile,"Berry and plum aromas offer a rousing opening that sets up lively red-fruit flavors.

125831,France,"This wine runs the gamut of crisp, mineral flavors. It is tight, driven by green flavors and acidity, with just a touch of vanilla.

125844,Italy,Ripe cherry and raspberry jam set the stage for this succulent and fruit-forward red wine from Sicily. There are some sweet flavors here that suggest a pairing with hamburgers or pasta with meat sauce.,,85,9.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Merlot,Villa Pozzi
125845,Italy,"If you're looking for a bright, easy wine to pair with pasta or pizza, this is it. Ruby-colored and medium-bodied, this Chianti offers informal aromas of wild berry, almond and cola backed by crisp acidity that makes it that much more appropriate as a companion to easy dishes.",Terra di Siena,85,,Tuscany,Chianti Colli Senesi,,Sangiovese,Tenuta di Trecciano
125846,US,"A solid everyday Merlot that offers plenty of ripe berry, cherry and smoky oak flavors now. Dry and tannic, it has enough stuffing and class to pair with a nice steak.",,85,20.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Simi
125847,New Zealand,"This wine shows some intriguing complexity in its herbal, leafy aromas tinged with woodsmoke and berries. It's medium-bodied, with tart berry flavors and some slightly astringent, tea-like notes on the finish. Drink now–2012.",,85,25.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Stone Paddock
125848,US,"Shows the rich flamboyance you expect in a Viognier, with enormously ripe tropical fruit, apricot, wildflower, vanilla and spice flavors. Easy to drink as a cocktail wine with hors d'oeuvres, like tempura dipped into soy sauce.",The Nice Catie's Corner Vineyard,85,33.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Sunbox Eleven
125849,Chile,"Made for Oops by VIA Wines, this oddball Chardonnay features 14% white Carmenère, meaning there's red fruit (without the skins) added to the blend to give bulk and texture. The result is a slightly waxy, sticky white with peach pit aromas followed by basic apple and citrus flavors. You don't taste any red fruit, but you do know that it's not 100% varietal Chardonnay. Drink now.",,85,12.0,Central Valley,,,Chardonnay,oops
125850,France,"Showing surprising age for such a young vintage, this is a wine that's ready. It is of course, like all Charles Heidsieck Champagnes, beautifully crafted, with its toast and spice element integrated deftly into the crisp fruits. A top quality Champagne, needing food for its full appreciation.",Vintage Brut,93,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Charles Heidsieck
125851,US,"Rigidity and acidity mark this young Pinot Noir. It's tart and a little tannic, but it has enormously rich flavors of cherries, currants, cola and pomegranates, enriched with smoky, spicy oak. Fine now with decanting and pairing with very rich fare, but should reward a few years in the cellar.",Pearlessence,93,38.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
125852,US,"A blend of the Tablas Creek and Alban clones, this Grenache is from the Stolpman Vineyard. Made using whole clusters in the fermentation, it's densely textured and brooding in tannins. But there's an enormous core of cherry fruit and spice. Should blossom in 2009 and hold for several more years.",Whole Cluster,93,42.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Grenache,Jaffurs
125853,France,"Owned by the Chancel family (whose main holdings are in the Lubéron in southern France), this small Champagne house has made an exceptional 1997.

125854,France,"The beautiful orange pink sunrise color sets the scene for a dry style of wine, very much in the Laurent-Perrier tradition.

A great wine, and a real food Champagne.",Grand Siècle Cuvée Alexandra Rosé Brut,93,300.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Laurent-Perrier
125855,US,"Returning to traditional fruit sources (Seven Hills and Pepper Bridge) after the freeze year of 2004, winemaker JF Pellet has crafted the finest Pepper Bridge Cabernet to date. Gorgeous aromas explode from the glass, a lush mix of flower, berry, mocha and sweet earth. Smooth and silky on the tongue, it's a riot of berry and cassis flavor, all in proportion and moving gracefully across the palate and into a round, detailed finish with whiffs of smoke, caramel and coffee grounds.",,93,55.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pepper Bridge
125856,France,"A powerful wine that is very ripe and soft. What makes it work so well is the toast, the acidity from a high proportion of Pinot Noir, and the dense, full structure. This is, without question, a food wine. It should also age over 4–5 years at least.",Cuvée 1522 Grand Cru Brut,93,100.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Philipponnat
125857,France,"Only disgorged in 2007, this fine vintage wine has preserved all its freshness. There are white fruits, pear juice, a crisp texture. They combine well to create a wine with considerable minerality, flinty, but full in the mouth. Age over the next 4–5 years.",Réserve Millésimée Brut,93,75.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Philipponnat
125858,US,"Partial whole-cluster fermentation gives this wine an earthy, tannic closedness, making it unsuitable for drinking now. But it's extraordinarily rich in cherry and currant fruit, with such a long sweet finish that it has got to be an ager. Try after 2009.",Ampelos Vineyard,93,42.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Samsara
125859,France,"A remarkable wine that manages effortlessly to bring together ripe apricot and sweet pear flavors with a balanced maturity that is so delicious. It has power and richness, but there is also minerality and a hint of a chalky texture. This 1999 needs less aging than previous vintages and can be drunk now.",Extra Cuvée de Réserve Blanc de Blancs Brut,93,128.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Pol Roger
125860,France,"From start to finish, this top quality vintage follows a straight line. It starts with freshness and explodes into richness. The initial very tight structure soon opens out with white pears and green plums, soft and ripe. The fruit is supported by the structure which offers orange zest. Like many 1999s, this is almost ready to drink.",Extra Cuvée de Réserve Vintage Brut,93,103.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Pol Roger
125861,US,"The 10% Petit Verdot stiffens up the tannins and has a lovely violet-scented floral component that counterpoints the cassis and black cherry fruit. It's a young, tight and beautifully crafted wine that has barely come out of the barrel; it's still shut down and shy. But all the right stuff is there for a long-lived, elegant and silky wine with great breed and style.",Vineyard Select,93,48.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Walla Walla Vintners
125862,US,"In this warm, ripe, lush and forward vintage, winemaker John Abbott has outdone himself. This is immediately appealing, sending a rush of black cherry and cassis fruit backed with darker notes of coffee, smoke and licorice. The flavors are dense and supple, and the wine combines grace and power, unfolding with additional layers of tar, green tea and smoky herb.",,93,42.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Abeja
125863,France,"A rich, rounded Champagne, ripe and fruity without being simplistic. The complexity comes from the toast, the vanilla and the spicy edge combining with the quince, pear and white peach flavors. The acidity is finely balanced.

125866,US,"Over the years Mondavi's Reserve has taken a turn toward Chablis. Fans of lush, superripe Chards will find it tart, but it's really balanced and elegant. With a dry tang of minerals, it shows bright Meyer lemon, lime, pineapple and white peach flavors. One-third new oak adds creamy, smoky vanilla complexities. Should develop over the next six years.",Reserve,93,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Robert Mondavi
125867,Argentina,"There's no other way to put it: Perdriel from Norton is one of Argentina's best high-end blends. It's rich and extracted, but still carries that just-right mix of preserving acidity, structured tannins and dynamite fruit. Opens with chocolate and berry marmalade, and then effortlessly transitions to flavors of cassis, blackberry and fudge. Touches of prune, leather and coffee grace the meaty, substantive finish. 500 cases made.",Perdriel Single Vineyard,93,,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Bodega Norton
125868,US,"Here's your basic thermonuclear Petite Sirah. It's huge, powerful, triumphant in its own varietal way. Has the soft lushness and immediate succulence of a modern cult Cabernet, with a vast array of chocolate, blackberry, blueberry and cherry pie filling flavors that are almost candied, but the finish is thoroughly dry. With its firm tannins, it should live for many years. If you're a “Pet” fan, this is the one to buy.",,93,45.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Petite Sirah,David Fulton
125869,France,"A great Champagne, rich and full-bodied, with a fine mineral streak and almost of austerity that demands aging. It is tight on the structure, yet ripe on the mature fruit, which is changing into its secondary toast, walnut and quince. It could still age over five years or more.",Millésimé Brut,93,95.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Henriot
125870,France,"Certainly dry, but not as seriously dry as previous vintages of Celebris, this latest release is in a more opulent style. There is the proper grapefruit, mineral and flint character. Add to that yeast and toast, and the wine shows fine complexity and aging potential.",Celebris Vintage Extra Brut,93,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Gosset
125871,US,"Rich and chocolaty, this dense and detailed wine is loaded with brambly fruit, ripe cherry and baking chocolate. It's dotted with fine-grained, coffee-streaked tannins, and finishes with highlights of butterscotch and malted milk candies. As with all the 2005 Quilceda's, this is still young and tight. It is dominated by the barrel flavors that only slowly meld into the massive fruit with extensive breathing time (36 hours after being opened the wine was still improving).",,93,75.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Quilceda Creek
125872,US,"Aloof now, this Cab holds you at a distance with its provocative tannins. But it's a very fine wine that shows real Napa pedigree. Balanced and harmonious, it features complex flavors of blackberries, cassis and cedar wood that turn sweet on the finish. Should be at its best between 2010 and 2013 and then slowly fade away.",,93,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Whitehall Lane
125873,France,"A Champagne that is very much wine.

125874,France,"You can tell that Pinot Noir dominates this wine. It is big, powerful, hinting at raspberries as well as delicious richness.

The final is a play on richness and structure.",Grand Cru Sélection Brut,93,55.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Pehu-Simonet
125875,France,"This is young, fresh, full and yeasty, with considerable richness. It shows the superlative quality of Charles Heidsieck as a Champagne producer.

125876,France,"Vintage 2002 is turning out to be a great year in Champagne, and this wine is a reflection of that. Made from the heart of the pressing, it starts crisp and creamy.

125881,US,"Young, elegant, spicy and still quite tight, this is showing lovely fragrances of rose and cherry. In the mouth it seems more elegantly feminine, less powerful than the Bruno's II blend.

125882,Greece,"A blend of two ancient white varieties—Assyrtiko and Asproudi—this wine offers clean, crisp aromas and flavors with a soft, fragrant roundness.

125888,US,"Not as forward and lush as the appealing 2005, this all-purpose red, tasted a few months prior to its official release, is still knitting the components together.

125899,US,"This is warm and loose, with fruit that is very ripe and just on the verge of pruney. The ripe fruit flavors seem to soften the tannins, which are also quite ripe and smooth. It tastes a bit like prune juice, but not unpleasantly so, with an acid base that compensates for the volatility of the finish. A drink-now wine, but it has its charms.",Alice Vineyard,86,28.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Petit Verdot,Tagaris

125903,US,"The blend here is the classic Bordeaux mix. It's a difficult vintage,  and this wine hits a wall of disjointed, chalky acid about midway through.

125929,France,"A weighty wine, with tight tannins on ripe plums, berries and a juicy, earthy flavor. It shows all the proper chunky character of Pommard, solid and foursquare.

125930,Italy,"This is a fantastically crisp white wine from Northern Italy that offers clean aromas of citrus, stone fruit, kiwi and white mineral.

125932,Chile,"Broad and somewhat generic in its aromas, but there's just enough varietal olive and herbal accents to convince you of its DNA.

A good wine that should not offend anyone.",Reserve,87,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trivento
125936,Chile,"Nice Pinot, with light tomato, mint, lemon peel and red plum aromas. The palate is dry and refreshing, with purity and citrusy raspberry/cherry flavors.

Long and lasting on the finish, with a spot of sweetness at the end.",Amplus,87,18.0,Leyda Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Santa Ema
125940,US,"This is a shy little wine, with woodsy overtones on a base of plum and raspberry fruit.

Drink now.",Vintner's Select,84,19.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Syrah,Glenora
125941,US,"The nose is flat, with good mineral character but only moderate ripeness and little fruit. The wine picks up in the mouth, with appealing green apple notes and mouthwatering acidity.

125942,Argentina,"Formely known as Winemaker's Selection, this base-level Malbec is ultra purple and dark, with gritty, grapey aromas that are big but not all that well formed. The palate is heavy and tannic, with juicy, semi-green flavors of blackberry and boysenberry. Has power, color and size but not all the parts fit.",,84,11.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Andeluna
125943,US,"This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc throws off some initial cooked aromas and a disjointed confected note. The palate is more successful with a nice plum jam character. This wine is one-dimensional and short but could be a good crowd pleaser for a casual occasion. Drink now.",Epic Reserve,84,25.0,New York,New York,New York Other,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Keuka Spring
125944,US,"The nose is honest and bright but not terribly expressive, with just a few delicate raspberry and cherry tones.

125947,US,"Charming and perfumed, with notes of musk, white flowers and wild grapes on the nose and exotic spices in the mouth.

125955,Argentina,"Sharp, minty aromas mixed with stemmy red fruit set up a modest, middleweight palate of semisweet, generic red fruit flavors. Quick on the finish, with a spot of green flavor. Good enough but lacks the concentration and deeper aromas and flavors of Urban Malbec.",Urban Uco,84,11.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Tempranillo,O. Fournier
125956,France,"In a piece of French wine shorthand, the new appellation of Saint-Bris takes in the old Sauvignon de Saint-Bris wines. The style, though, hasn't changed: an attractive, if rustic type, with crisp gooseberry and grapefruit flavors and a fresh burst of acidity. Screwcap.",Sauvignon de Saint-Bris,84,13.0,Burgundy,Saint-Bris,,Sauvignon Blanc,Simonnet-Febvre

125958,Argentina,"Foxy and jumpy smelling at first, with brambly raspberry aromas. The palate feels heavy and baked, with grabby tannins in support of herbal, mildly weedy berry fruit flavors. Finishes saucy, with a hint of tomato. Not pure and focused like the La Flor Malbec.",La Flor,84,16.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pulenta Estate
125959,US,"Fresh berries and sawdust open this juicy, medium-bodied red. Blackberry pie flavors give way to notes of charred meat and licorice on the medium finish. Definitely a food wine - try with hearty meat dishes.",,84,18.0,Missouri,Augusta,,Norton,Augusta Winery
125960,Argentina,"Starts out strong with lemon, apple and other fresh-fruit aromas. The flavors are more mealy and warm, and the palate feel is oily.

125961,US,"Clove and vanilla make for a serious, if not terribly refreshing, opening. There's nice grapefruit and pomelo fruit here and a medium, lemony finish that veers towards tart. Drink up.",Founder's Field Reserve,84,26.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Sauvignon Blanc,Castello di Borghese
125962,Argentina,"Very light in color and body, with citric and chewing gum aromas along with a spot of caramel. The palate is lean, jumpy and fresh, with tart cherry and plum skin flavors. Borders on sour but doesn't quite go that far. Lean Pinot any way you slice it.",Reserve,84,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Noir,Cruz Alta
125963,Chile,"Starts with stemmy, burnt aromas but after time oak notes cover things up. Apple, sweet pear, buttery oak and popcorn are the main flavors on this sweet, pithy wine that when stripped down is fairly hollow and simple.",Special Selection,84,15.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Chardonnay,El Huique

125967,Chile,"Dry, brambly raspberry and cherry aromas lack much varietal character, while the palate is lively with acids but the flavors are drying, herbal and peppery, with basic plum and berry at the base. Decent wine but that's about it.",,84,10.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Carmenère,Carma
125968,US,"Although the residual sugar on this dessert Zin is a hefty 9%, it's unbalanced. Doesn't have the fruity concentration it needs, leaving it basically a melange of alcohol and sweetness.",Late Harvest,84,24.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars

125970,US,"Soft and delicious, if a little one-dimensional. No denying the lushness of the pineapple, orange and golden apricot fruit flavors, or the pretty spices. Sémillon adds a cashew nut oiliness. Could use greater dryness and acidity.",,87,27.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Duckhorn
125971,US,"Judicious use of darkly toasted Hungarian oak results in a surprisingly sexy, supple wine that's dripping with vanilla and spicy dark plum flavors. There's a slight green twinge to the black cherry flavors on the palate, but this is a smooth, easy-drinking Merlot with a long, earthy, espresso finish.",Hungarian Oak,87,20.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Merlot,Comtesse Thérèse

125973,Italy,"This 70-20-10 blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot shows loads of zesty pepper and green spice. Aromatically speaking, the Cabernet component seems strongest. There's bright blackberry and cherry in the mouth with a touch of natural rubber.",Grale,87,,Tuscany,Bolgheri,,Red Blend,Le Grascete
125974,Italy,"A pure expression of Ciliegiolo (a native grape of central Italy), this bright ruby wine delivers crisp tones of cassis, white cherry and raspberry. It's a clean, easy wine that would pair well with cheesy pasta or risotto.",,87,,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Le Tre Stelle
125975,Spain,"This vintage rosado is as good as always, but a bit lower on the quality ladder than previous years.

125977,US,"This is a very dry, richly textured Cabernet, vast in blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors, with the smooth, complex tannins Oakville is known for. However, there's a noticeable sharpness to the mouthfeel that may never go away.",Bonny's Vineyard,87,135.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Meyer Family Cellars
125978,Spain,"Normally this producer's high-end Sherries are outstanding, but this Amontillado is aggressive and hard, with a clod-like character that starts with molasses on the nose and then turns toward sharpness and bitterness on the palate. Try as I might, this one strikes me as good but loud, hard, forceful and lacking the suavity that great Sherries possess.",Del Duque Amontillado Muy Viejo,87,45.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,González Byass
125979,US,"A good, soft wine to drink now with a steak or chop. It's full-bodied and very rich in extracted blackberry jam and crème de cassis flavor, with touches of pepper, cocoa and bacon.",Jack London Vineyard,87,25.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Kenwood
125980,Spain,"This is your quintessential simple quaff among brut cavas. It's clean, lime-tinged and soda-like on the nose, with a correct, no-issues palate that pushes zesty apple along with sweet papaya, mango and banana flavors. It's slightly sweet and tropical, but still it holds onto its crisp qualities and dryness. No complaints for the money.",Cordon Negro Brut,87,12.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet

125982,Spain,"Slightly low on kick and bubbles for a blanc de blancs, but the wine's mix of green herb, apple, green banana and melon flavors is good and offers the proper set up to a finish that's citrusy as can be and only slightly pithy. Seems a touch flat or it might have rated even higher.",Brut Blanc de Blancs,87,18.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Paul Cheneau
125983,US,"A delicious, balanced Pinot Noir. Shows dry, pure flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and sandalwood, with a delicious, drink-me-now appeal.",Radog,87,28.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Radog
125984,Spain,"Dusty, slightly candied aromas are briary and pretty good, and overall it's giving freshness, pop and red-fruit flavors touched up by dill, nutmeg and vanilla. Clean and lively on the finish, and more than competent as a whole.",Limited Edition,87,17.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
125985,US,"A very good interpretation of Sangiovese. A pretty sharp mouthfeel, but maybe that's to be expected from this high-acid variety. Otherwise, it's nice and dry, with complex cherry, red currant, licorice, leather and sandalwood flavors. Good with spicy beef, pork and veal dishes.",Lola,87,24.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Stave 28
125986,US,"Very good for its complexity, although it's tough and tannic, and the acidity sticks out.

Odds are the lifespan is six years: cellar or decant.",Three Blocks,87,49.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Signaterra Benziger
125987,Spain,"Starts out with roasted, stewy, beefy aromas and not much brightness. The palate is measured and healthy, with dry raspberry, currant and medicinal plum flavors.

In a nutshell, it's a good, standard, respectable Rioja that will complement almost any food.",Reserva,87,26.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Solabal
125988,Portugal,"From 100% Azal grapes, this is a rich style of Vinho Verde, ripe and citric, touched by minerality. Yeasty aromas go through the palate but don't detract from the ripe final fruit.",Azal,87,12.0,Vinho Verde,,,Portuguese White,Solar de Pinheiro
125989,US,"Made in the modern California Chardonnay style you'll either love or hate. It's enormously extracted in pineapple tart, crème brûlée and honey-drizzled buttered toast flavors, and the acidity is bright and clean. The superrichness would benefit from greater control.",Reserve,87,27.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sonoma-Loeb
125990,Spain,"A heavy, slightly strained wine that has a lot in tow. The nose is smoky, rubbery like an inner tube, and a bit herbal. In the mouth, it's a wide load with sweet, sugary, baked flavors of blackberry, prune, fig and chocolate. Very much on the ripe side, with a full tannic bite.",Lanzaga,87,34.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Telmo Rodríguez
125991,US,"This is dusty, and scented with earth and pine needles. Quite young, it tastes very tart, almost like cranberry juice.

125992,Spain,"Initially it's rugged, but airing reveals black-cherry aromas and dry spice. The palate is crisp and a little sheer by itself, but the call here is that with food it'll be a winner. Flavors of red fruits are dry and collected, while the finish blends in coffee, spice and a touch of herbal Navarran panache.",Crianza,87,15.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Marco Real
125993,US,"Tough in tannins and acidic in the Mayacamas style. Feels hard and dry and earthy. The cherry-berry flavors have a tomatoey edge.

125995,Spain,"Good on the nose, with solid raspberry and nectarine aromas. The palate is spunky and alert, with juicy red-cherry, rhubarb and integrated spice flavors.

126000,South Africa,"Cinnamon, pepper and black cherry aromas start this ageable blend of Shiraz, Merlot and Cabernet.

126001,US,"Soft and a bit hot in alcohol, this Cab has luscious flavors of blackberry jam, licorice and smoky oak. It's pretty tannic now, with a sandpapery mouthfeel. Doesn't seem like an ager, but nice now through 2011.",Estate,88,55.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frazier

126003,US,"Good for Hendry for going with this Spanish variety. It shows the new trend toward higher acid, drier white wines that appeal for their directness.

126009,US,"Here is a good value effort, smoky, chewy and dense, with strong flavors but solid Merlot varietal character. There is unusual smokiness in the wine—presumably from barrel toast—but enough ripe fruit to offset that and the substantial tannins. The spicy finish suggests American oak barrels were used.",,88,15.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Merlot,Whidbey Island Winery
126010,New Zealand,"Shows some slightly flinty notes on the nose, while the bulk of the flavors run more toward citrus and nectarine.

126013,US,"The best of the 2006 McKinley Springs reds, this overcomes a fairly heavy dose of vanilla-flavored oak and moves into mixed cherry, plum, mocha, coffee and spice.

126016,New Zealand,"Bears a bit of resemblance to some Monterey Chardonnays, offering smoky notes of grilled sweet corn and peaches and a bold, powerful palate presence. Shows perhaps a little too much toast on the finish, but this is a boldly flavored Chardonnay that can stand up to grilled salmon.",Falveys,88,21.0,Marlborough,,,Chardonnay,Omaka Springs
126017,Italy,You don't see many wines made from the Bovale grape;  it once faced extinction but is now being slowly replanted in Sardinia. Essentija represents a style the winemaker's grandfather once made and offers compact color and structure with slightly rustic aromas of mature fruit and light spice.,Essentija,88,,Sicily & Sardinia,Isola dei Nuraghi,,Bovale,Pala
126018,Australia,"Loose End is a line of wines produced by former Penfolds viticulturist Rob Gibson to offer immediate accessibility. This slightly tarry, plummy offering meets that goal at a resonable price. A small Viognier addition provides aromatic lift and contributes to the creamy, supple mouthfeel.",,88,23.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Loose End
126019,France,"White, almost jammy fruits, mingle with acidity, minerality and tight tannins. This is a wine that offers spice, superrich fruit and intensity of flavor.

126020,France,"Very perfumed Pinot Noir aromas, a wine that offers more than usual weight for a red Sancerre, as well as ripe plums and some sweetness. The texture is soft, juicy, only a touch of dry tannin at the heart, while the finish is all freshness and vivid berry acidity.",,88,28.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Pinot Noir,Château de Sancerre
126021,France,"Spicy, smoky fruit, with soft tannins and a fresh tobacco aroma, this wine exhibits all the enticing characters of cool-climate Cabernet Franc.

126023,Australia,"This blend comes across as less weighty and extracted than many Australian reds, but instead offers a medium-bodied blend of cherry, plum, cola and baking-spice flavors. It's creamy in texture but fully dry, with a touch of coffee on the lingering finish. Drink now.",Contour 4 Sangiovese-Shiraz,88,18.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Red Blend,Coriole

126025,New Zealand,"Like all of the Kumeu River Chardonnays, this wine, blended from several vineyards, boasts great harmony and balance.

126026,Australia,"An unusual blend that includes 25% Petit Verdot, the Kurtz Family's Seven Sleepers features an intense, welcoming bouquet of black cherries, cinnamon and coffee backed by cherry fruit and earthy flavors.

Very refreshing and clean.",,88,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Viognier,William Church
126030,US,"Smells and tastes super-oaky, with dominating notes of vanilla, clove, dill and caramel. Although there's a ton of cherry, chocolate and raspberry fruit, sweet vanilla and toast still is the main element. Maybe it's going through a dumb phase and simply needs time. Try again after 2011.",Vintner Select,87,75.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Pride Mountain
126031,Italy,"Here's a nicely clean and compact Barbera d'Asti with pretty, albeit simple, aromas of wild fruit, pomegranate juice and fresh blueberries.

126032,US,"Hard and tough in tannins now, with a dry astringency. It's a good, balanced Cabernet, with very rich blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors, but those gritty tannins are difficult. Give it a few years in the cellar.",,87,30.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,William Hill Estate

126035,Chile,"Purple as they come, with minty, savory, charred aromas that dominate. Airing tones things down, revealing blackberry, spice, butter and creaminess along with big tannins, bite, clamp and weight. Among roasted, peppery big boys, this treads the line deftly and is worth the money.",Toro de Piedra,87,13.0,Curicó Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Viña Requingua
126036,Italy,There are brambly notes here of forest floor and underbrush backed by enough fresh fruit to keep the wine chewy and fresh in the mouth. You'll also get notes of wet tobacco and wild mushroom that add complexity.,,87,22.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,,Barbera,Bricco dei Guazzi

126038,Italy,"This Barbera shows a twofold aromatic approach that puts as much emphasis on its drying mineral tones as it does on the integrity of the fruit. Cherry, blackberry and spice appear and there's a crisp blast of acidity on the close.",Altea,87,,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,,Barbera,Cantine Sant'Agata

126040,Italy,Here's a thickly extracted and dense interpretation of Barbera lavished over with intense secondary aromas of oaky spice and toasted wood. There's a lot of wood here that is offputting at first but that will hopefully find harmony with more years in the bottle.,Mongovone,87,35.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,,Barbera,Elio Perrone
126041,Chile,"Rich, roasted and defined by rugged black fruit and black olive aromas. Nice acidity renders it fit as opposed to heavy and overextracted. Flavors of wild berry and coffee are good, and the finish shows mint chocolate chip and snap. Very good for the price.",,87,9.0,Central Valley,,,Carmenère,Espiritu de Chile
126042,Italy,"Although this is a young Barbera—from the 2008 vintage—the wine already shows signs of aging.

126047,Australia,"Despite the reasonable price tag, this is a very good bottle of Cabernet, the kind that should be poured by the glass at your local steakhouse.

126048,US,"Stonetree and Coyote Canyon are the vineyard sources for this rare Washington Primitivo. Briary and brambly, it does not have the cut tobacco character of Italian Primitivo, nor the depth of color and tannin. Some leafy herbal flavors compete with the mixed red fruits.",,87,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Primitivo,Angel Vine
126049,Chile,"A little soapy on the nose, with air freshener, cherry candy and soft berry aromas. The palate follows what the nose offers with richness and soft tannins along with blackberry and blueberry flavors. Not very spicy for a Syrah; it's more of a baked, toasty, generic red wine that tastes good but isn't complex or varietal in nature.",,87,19.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Syrah,Arboleda
126050,US,"This is a rather light, surprisingly delicate take on Petite Sirah, with pretty aromas of violets and spice. When first poured it seems shut down; it opens slowly but has a bit of a hole in the middle, before moving into a tannic finish with dark chocolate and licorice.",Wahluke Slope Vineyard,87,28.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Petite Sirah,Arbor Crest
126051,Italy,"Here's a Barbera d'Alba that is almost too much of a good thing. The wine is black and dense with inky concentration and thick aromas of smoked bacon, beef jerky and black fruit. You'll also recognize tones of moist earth and wild mushroom. The fruit seems on the ripe and jammy side and the wine is smooth and thick in the mouth.",Bric Loira,87,40.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Cascina Chicco
126052,Italy,"Here's a decidedly uncomplicated expression of Dolcetto from vintner Paolo Veglio that plays its fruit and spice cards very well. You'll get tones of blueberry, plum and wild berry, with a touch of cinnamon and clove at the end. The tannic structure is firm enough to contend with creamy cheese.",,87,16.0,Piedmont,Dolcetto d'Alba,,Dolcetto,Cascina Roccalini
126053,US,"Columbia is moving to a mainstream style as the influence of ownership and winemaker changes begin to be felt. This is a well-proportioned Merlot, with purple fruits and polished tannins. The addition of Malbec (along with tiny portions of four other red grapes) brings in spice and pepper highlights.",,87,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Columbia Winery
126054,Chile,"Cola, licorice and blackberry all dance together on the bouquet, which is big and magnetic. The palate is dark and deep, with lush, potent berry fruit, chocolate and spice flavors. Rugged, full-bodied and strong more than elegant and refined.",,87,10.0,Rapel Valley,,,Carmenère,Lucky7

126056,US,"A very good, richly tannic wine that flatters with strong flavors of blackberries, cherries and oak. It may be a little too ripe for its own good, though, as it's pretty jammy. For some reason, the winery lowered the price considerably from the 2005, which was a much better wine.",55% Slope,87,40.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hidden Ridge
126057,Italy,"There's a raw, vinous quality to this wine that is made even more apparent thanks to the enormous thickness and extraction of its mouthfeel. You almost smell the winery here and get a good whiff of the freshness and overall maturity of the fruit. Its texture is extra chewy and plush.",Asia,87,,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,,Barbera,I Quaranta

126059,Chile,"Black cherry and cassis aromas mix with some heat, rubber and harshness on the bouquet.

Roasted and dark on the finish, and rugged overall.",Casa,87,13.0,Rapel Valley,,,Merlot,Lapostolle
126060,Spain,"Definitely a once-ripe, raisiny wine with hard Toro tannins and molasses aromas and flavors. Borderline syrupy but with enough structure and grip to make the grade.

126061,Italy,A sinewy wine that begins with barnyard and blueberries wrapped around a mineral core.

Drink now.,Serraboella,88,30.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Cigliuti
126062,Spain,"Bold and chunky Ribera wine with black fruit aromas that don't tread lightly.

Drink now.",,88,25.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Comenge
126063,US,"Very rich, oaky and acidic, showing the crisp, minerally profile that usually marks white wines from this Monterey appellation. The flavors veer toward lemons, limes and Asian pears.

From old vineyards, this is pure fruit, very direct, concentrated.",Clos Triguedina La Chapelle du Clos,88,,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec-Merlot,Jean-Luc Baldès
126065,US,"Strong in flavor, showing the ripeness and crispness of all Bjornstad's Chardonnays, with lemondrop, lime tart, vanilla and buttered toast flavors.

126066,Spain,"There's an exotic twist to the nose, which rests on black cherry, plum and a splash of black coffee.

126067,Spain,"Full, ripe and so tannic in its present form that it's scratchy and hard on the mouth. Aromas of ripe berry and syrup hint at its core power, while flavors of blackberry, fresh raisin and chocolate are true and good.

126068,US,"This Bordeaux-Syrah blend is very good, a dry, full-bodied red that will be versatile at the table.

It's a fine wine to enjoy over the next three years.",Maximus,88,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,Bennett Lane
126069,Argentina,"Praise before criticism, and we like the wine's stocky body, bright color and mouthfeel. In those categories, it's a high flier. But there's also a briny, pickled accent to the nose and accents of olive, rhubarb and herbaceousness. Interesting in that it differs greatly from Alta Vista's Temis.",Single Vineyard Serenade,88,50.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Alta Vista

126071,Australia,"There's a healthy 8% Viognier in the blend, but this wine doesn't come across as overtly apricotty.

126074,Spain,"Peachy, mildly sweet, smooth and inviting. Godeval always makes a true and easy wine that showcases the essence of Godello but doesn't go off the blueprint.

126104,US,"Much better than the watery 2004, this wine still seems a bit light and thin for its Reserve status. It's got some tart, sharp flavors of wild blackberry, but the herbal flavors suggest unripe grapes.",Reserve,84,23.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Snoqualmie

126149,US,"The cool climate of the northern Salinas Valley enabled the grapes to hang long into the harvest while maintaining bright acidity. The result is a lovely Riesling, off-dry and refreshing in the manner of a fine German wine. It was blended with a splash of Muscat.

You find a pretty, floral nose, followed with cured meats, some saltiness too, and very dark fruit flavors with a lot of smoke and tar. This has the firm acidic base of Tempranillo, with immense extraction of color, tannin and plenty of bacon fat in the finish. It's full, almost fleshy, with texture and flavor.

Medium-full on the palate with a hint of sanguine character, this comes off a bit brighter and more balanced than one might anticipated from the bouquet.",Fernand Averoux,87,30.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Minervois,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine Sainte Léocadie
126276,US,"A delicious Pinot Noir. Set it beside more expensive bottlings and it stands up well.

126278,Spain,"A touch raisiny and sweet from nose to tail, but what's in between is convincing for Jumilla. Aromas of licorice and herbs are sweet but nice, while the flavors or raisin and blackberry are chunky, with a basic finish that's a little flat but definitely ripe. A blend of Monastrell, Cabernet, Tempranillo and Merlot that's ready to drink.",Taja Reserva,87,12.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Red Blend,Bodegas Mähler-Besse

126280,US,"This is Goldeneye's basic appellation Pinot. It's fairly rich in cherries, raspberries, cola, red currant, licorice and sandalwood, with an elegantly crisp mouthfeel. But it lacks excitement, especially at this price. Drink now.",,87,58.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Goldeneye

126282,US,"Bone dry with aromas of freshly pressed apples, this is an austere but elegant sparkling blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.

Wiemer
126283,US,"Full bodied with a velvety heft on the palate, this Reserve Merlot from Hudson-Chatham offers a striking balance of intensity and elegance.

126284,US,"Good and dry. Trades richness for a certain aloof elegance, and while it could be denser in fruit, the blackberry, currant and mocha flavors are just fine. Drink now. Production was 16,130 cases.",Jack London Vineyard,87,35.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenwood
126285,US,"Like the label suggests, it's sugary in tangerine, vanilla cookie and butterscotch flavors, with crisp acidity and fine, scoury bubbles. A nice sparkling wine for those who like a sweeter style.",Sweet Cuvée,87,13.0,California,California,California Other,Sparkling Blend,Korbel
126286,Spain,"For Spanish Chardonnay, this is perfectly good and clean. The nose brings your basic set of white-fruit, mineral and fresh herb flavors, while the palate is lively despite some dry, resiny oak flavor. Even with banana, vanilla and creamy flavors, the wine is decidedly not cloying.",,87,14.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Chardonnay,Vega Sindoa

126289,US,"Soft, pretty and pleasant to drink, the widely-available Willamette Valley bottling from Amity might pass for a simple Bourgogne rouge.

126291,US,"There's an interesting counterplay between the bright and the dark in Lovingston's hand-picked, small lot Josie's Knoll. On the nose, black cherry preserves are countered with black pepper spice and char. On the palate, ripe, concentrated black fruit is layered with tar, earth and bramble. It's elegant and seductive, but anchored by a core of gripping tannins.",Josie's Knoll,87,15.0,Virginia,Monticello,,Merlot,Lovingston
126292,Spain,"This winery is known for red Mencía, but this small-lot Godello is perfectly nice and drinkable. It has a neutral nose and a fresh palate of green melon, nectarine and apple flavors. The finish is clipped and a touch bitter, but there's no denying its tangy, forward approach. Only 250 cases made.",,87,22.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Godello,Luna Beberide
126293,US,"This is a dry, clean, crisp Roussanne wine whose dominant flavors are of oranges and apricots. Oak brings additional notes of vanilla and buttered toast.

126294,US,"This is one of those wines that taste sweet and dry at the same time. There's superripe orange and pineapple marmalade fruit, but then clean acidity and a stony minerality wash over the palate, making the finish dry. It's an interesting blend of Roussanne, Grenache Blanc and Viognier.",Patriarche Blanc,87,25.0,California,El Dorado,Sierra Foothills,Rhône-style White Blend,Holly's Hill
126295,Portugal,"Celebrating the first lot—Port—in the first auction held by Michael Broadbent in 1966, this is a reserve style wine, rich and soft with chocolate and ripe berry flavors to go with the sweet texture. There is just a final edge of stalkiness.",Lot 1 Auction Reserve,87,27.0,Port,,,Port,Broadbent

126297,Spain,"Dusty earth and dry spice aromas blend with some char, vanilla and berry/cherry on the nose.

Finishes dry and peppery, with some toast.",Reserva,87,25.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Dinastía Vivanco

126302,Italy,Here's a fresh and zippy Barbera d'Asti aged only in stainless steel with pristine notes of fresh berry fruit and cooling acidity to match. It's an easy red wine with a simple but genuine flavor profile that would pair with home-cooked pasta.,Lavignone,87,13.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,,Barbera,Pico Maccario
126303,US,"A bit too tannic and acidic, with a hard edge that interferes with the palate's enjoyment of the pure, refined raspberry, cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors. A good, distinguished Pinot, but lacks voluptuousness due to the coarseness. Drink now.",,87,50.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Twomey

126305,Chile,"Starts out with proprietary aromas of clove, spice and cinnamon, and in the mouth it's a tannic grabber with forcefulness as well as ripe, sweet, menthol-infused berry flavors. Falls off somewhat on the finish, where butter and candy come in. Heavy and dark but still good for a New World Syrah.",La Capitana Barrel Reserve,87,17.0,Cachapoal Valley,,,Shiraz,Viña La Rosa
126306,New Zealand,"A simple, fruity wine that features ample pink grapefruit and gooseberry aromas and flavors, this is a bit of a one-trick pony, but it delivers those bold fruit flavors with authority. Drink up.",Cellar Selection,87,13.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Sileni
126307,New Zealand,"The bottle may not be traditional, but what's inside is typical Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, loaded with upfront passion fruit and hints of bell pepper. It fades a bit quickly on the finish, but it's a plump, medium-bodied example of the type and nicely balanced for the price.",,87,12.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Silver Birch
126308,Italy,"There are brambly, wild berry or crabapple notes here that are reinforced by the wine's naturally high acidity. This Barbera shows a pretty ruby color with dense thickness and a smooth, berry-filled finish.",La Ribelle,87,20.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,,Barbera,Montalbera
126309,South Africa,So fresh and inviting with lovely sweet pea and grass florals alongside soft notes of ripe nectarine and melon.

126310,Chile,"Aromas of tree bark, vanilla and herbs mix with peppery red fruit scents, while the palate is comfortable and herbal, with plum and dry oak notes.

126311,Chile,"Smoky smelling and toasty, with peach, melon and cider aromas. The body is solid and held together by nice acidity, while the flavors of banana, melon and citrus are sweet but not quite candied in nature. Pretty much your standard, textbook, well-made Chardonnay.",,87,17.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Arboleda
126312,Chile,"A nice, simple everyday Cabernet is what this is. The nose is sweet and smooth, with slightly candied red fruit aromas.

126318,Italy,"Lively and vibrant with loads of wild berries and black fruit, this is an oak-aged Dolcetto that lives up to the best qualities this native Italian grape can offer.

126319,Italy,"This is a beautiful estate with an amphitheater of vines that represents one of the biggest single vineyards of Barbera in the Asti area. This particular expression ushers forth aromas of ripe fruit, smoked bacon and blackberry jam. It's clean, compact and fresh on the close.",,87,,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,,Barbera,Castello del Poggio
126320,Italy,"Heavy oak use is still evident (this wine is from the 2006 vintage so those toasted notes should be integrated by now) and takes away from the natural integrity of the fruit. Spice, tobacco and chocolate appear and the wine ends with fresh crispness.",Vigna Valentino Caligaris,87,,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,,Barbera,Castello di Razzano
126321,Italy,This Barbera from the Monferrato area offers more evolved notes of spice and nut along with bright fruit and berry tones.

126326,US,"Not showing all that well now, with cola, currant, plum and oak flavors that are a little jammy and direct, and marked by dry tannins. It's a good, well-structured wine, though, and could just be going through an awkward phase.",Estate,87,50.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Iron Horse

126328,US,"The winery's most popular wine, Cali is 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 47% Merlot and 4% Sangiovese.

126330,Australia,"A solid example of cool-climate Australian Cabernet, Yering Station's 2005 boasts slightly lifted aromas of dried spices and wintergreen, easing into cassis and mint on the palate. It's a bit austere and firm right now, worth holding 2–3 years. To drink now, pair with rare beef or lamb.",,88,18.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Yering Station
126331,Chile,"Very nice, with aromas of olive, herbal plum, bacon, salami and leather. It's fresh and lively in the mouth, but with some weight and heft.

126332,US,"As usual, the Nina Lee Syrah is dark, chewy, and hits the mid-fifteens with its alcohol. But it somehow pulls together an impression of balance, highlighted by sweet and tangy blueberry/blackberry fruit. The acids are not quite integrated, and the wine has lost some subtlety – it has traded its elegance for sheer fruit power.",Nina Lee,88,50.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Spring Valley Vineyard
126333,US,"Scents of prune, coffee and smoke lead into a chewy, substantial wine with plenty of concentration.

The best of the new releases from Lone Canary.",,88,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Lone Canary
126334,France,"It is the blend of Malbec (Cot) and Cabernet Franc that gives this wine its intense, dry, tannic core.

126336,Australia,"Not quite as intense or concentrated as Burge's Filsell Shiraz, but made in a similar style, with notes of roasted coffee and grilled meat accenting raspberry fruit.

126338,New Zealand,"Burgundy purists might turn up their noses, but that's their loss, as Forrest's 2007 Pinot Noir offers a lush, round mouthful of black cherry fruit, providing ample drinking pleasure. Coffee and vanilla nuances are testament to its oak-derived complexity, helping the wine go down easily. Drink now.",,88,20.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Forrest Estate
126339,France,"Spicy and minty, here is a wine full of fresh, soft flavors, but given a backbone by some dusty, warm tannins. It is perfumed, the fruit given a vibrant edge, and demanding food. Drink now and over two years.",Cuvée Suptil,88,,Loire Valley,Anjou,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,Domaine de Montgilet
126340,France,"The Aubance is part of the network of small rivers that eventually flows into the Loire in Anjou. The appellation produces gently sweet wines like this one, from Chenin Blanc.

126345,US,"The Frederick is Spring Valley's Bordeaux blend  and it would be nice to see Spring Valley turn it down a bit and bring back some of the toasted grain nuances that set it apart from the rest of the Walla Walla AVA.

126347,New Zealand,"Made in a bold, fruit-driven style, the 2007 Pinot Noir from Nautilus places black cherry fruit front and center, surrounding it with just enough cola, mushroom and gentle spice to make for pleasing complexity.

126349,US,"A first-time red blend from Nefarious.

126355,Australia,"Starts off promising, with some dark fruit aromas and an attractive tea-like nuance, then delivers simpler, somewhat grapy fruit flavors.

Probably best in another year or two.",Mountain Estate,87,14.0,Australia Other,Central Ranges,,Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon,Inkberry
126356,Chile,"A little herbal and green-ish, but not too much so.

126361,Italy,"Dense and gripping, this Nebbiolo d'Alba outdoes many Barolos. The complex nose shows blueberry notes and lifted aromas of perfumed soap. The palate is concentrated but in a closed state; leather and tar notes dominate but yield to refreshing blackberry flavors on the finish.

126364,US,"Shows the brilliantly clean, racy acidity of Monterey that provides backbone and firmness to the citrus, peach, wildflower and mineral flavors.

126367,France,"Somebody was carried away with wood here. The wine is totally dominated by flavors of burnt wood— even the 50% new wood was too much in 2007. That said, the fruit could increase in weight and black berry flavors. But not just yet—in another three to four years.",La Commandery,88,24.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Château la Caminade
126368,Spain,"A blend of Tempranillo with Cab Sauvignon and Merlot. Aromas of black cherry, spice, aged cheese and earth are solid, while the palate features good fruit but some weakness in structure. Flavors of black cherry and berry are rich at first but fade fast, while the finish is nice but short on complexity. Drink now through 2012.",TSM,88,,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Carmelo Rodero
126369,Argentina,"Clean, straightforward aromas of berry, cassis and mineral are nice, while the palate has ample lushness, purity and focus.

126371,Italy,"There's a lot going on here, with a profusion of black fruit flavors underscored by an edgy ash note.

126373,US,"Despite the “valley” appellation, this is one of the highest elevation vineyards in Sonoma County. It's a dense, tannic, concentrated wine, with a deep core of black currants, black pepper and chocolate. Zinfanatics will absolutely love it, but it's very high in alcohol, almost Port-like, although the finish is absolutely dry.",Bismark Mountain Vineyard,88,65.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hanna

126376,Australia,"Starts off with some Rhône-like aromas of smoke, cracked pepper, blueberries and a touch of meatiness, then delivers vibrant fruit and spice on the palate.

Like most C-H, enjoy it on the young side for its fresh, juicy fruit.",,88,14.0,New South Wales,Hilltops,,Shiraz,Nine Stones
126377,Spain,"A round, full specimen with mineral-laden raspberry aromas and a fresh but serious palate of berry, cherry cough drop and fine rubber.

126378,US,"Shows the fruity ripeness that Paso Robles so easily achieves, with waves of blackberries and cassis. Yet there's also good structure, with rich, fine tannins and a good spine of acidity. With a slightly sweet finish, it's an elegant Cabernet to drink now.",,88,21.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Hall
126379,Argentina,"A nice Torrontés with good muscat-like aromas along with a blast or orange blossom. The palate has weight, roundness and good, true flavors of lemon, orange and melon. Long and rock-solid on the finish, with focus throughout. Drink soon.",Unoaked Reserva,88,17.0,Other,Salta,,Torrontés,Terrazas de Los Andes
126380,Italy,"This is a powerful bully of a wine but a good value in the pricey Barolo category.

Give it a few years to grow up.",,88,16.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Veglio

126382,Italy,"After initial notes of fresh paint blew off, deep berry fruit and woodsy aromas took over, making for a strong opening. Red plum and campfire flavors unfold in the mouth and show good depth. The lightly spiced finish winds up slightly hot. Will hold a year or two but unlikely to improve substantially.",Bionzo,88,50.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,,Barbera,La Spinetta
126383,US,"This is a 100% Cabernet, grown further north than the winery's amazing Rockaway bottling, which is to say in a hotter area. Comparisons are inevitable. Although it's rich and even dramatic, it's not as impressive a wine, showing a raisiny edge to the black currants and chocolate. Doesn't have the balance for aging, so drink now with upscale beef and lamb dishes.",Brothers Ridge Single Vineyard,88,75.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
126384,Italy,"Pio Cesare's Barbera is a modern interpretation of a traditional grape, and a well-done one at that.

126386,Spain,"Coconut and vanilla aromas are squarely in the lead, but the nose's berry base is more than solid.

126396,US,"A Right Bank Bordeaux-style blend, 45% Cabernet Franc and 55% Merlot. The fruit is marginally ripe but thin, and there is a watery character to the midpalate.

126397,Italy,"The hot vintage shows strongly, perhaps because this estate is located in the western part of Montalcino where elevations are lower and temperatures are a few degrees higher.

126411,Argentina,"A bit heavy and granular on the nose, with oily aromas that raise question marks.

Seems to be fading.",Poesia,84,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Hélène Garcin

126417,Chile,"Lightly herbal and light in body, with earthy aromas that include leather, tea and dried fruits. This is medium-bodied in style, with elegance.

126422,Italy,"This Sangiovese offers a pretty ruby color with thickly saturated color and segues into pretty aromas of spice, wood, red cherry and Asian spice. It has a wide, broad approach and very far-reaching intensity. But it also has many burnt wood nuances that boarder on being too heavy, especially considering the wine's delicate core of red fruit. The mouthfeel is just as overdone with deep menthol and cola flavors and a long, spicy finish.",Calistri,87,,Central Italy,Umbria,,Sangiovese,Castello di Corbara
126423,Italy,"Sangiovese (50%) is blended with equal parts Merlot and Cabernet to produce a simple red wine with thin berry fruit aromas, forest berry, floral nuances and some sharp points of bright acidity.

126426,US,"From a vineyard north of St. Helena comes this 100% varietal wine. If you like your Cabs soft, superextracted and direct, you'll love it.

126427,US,"Made in the Trinchero style, which traditionally has been a little monochromatic on first release, but ageable.

The wine has a friendly nature that lends it to food pairing.",,87,29.0,Villány,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gere Attila
126432,US,"This is fairly soft and sweet, with pleasant flavors of peaches and honey. It is a well-made late harvest Chenin, but simple.

126447,US,"This is firm and well-oaked, with the customary high alcohol levels that Spring Valley has been able to manage so well in the past. But at 15+% one expects to find commensurate weight and density; this feels like a much lighter wine, as far as the fruit concentration is concerned. The tannins are still a bit rough and slightly bitter, and the cherry fruit flavors not quite up to carrying all that new oak.",Muleskinner,87,35.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Spring Valley Vineyard

126453,US,"Entirely off the estate, this polished young Pinot offers a complex mélange of flavors, in a balanced structure. The tastes of root beer, red currants, licorice, gingersnap cookie and sweet oak are frankly delicious.

126454,France,"A blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier, this softly rich wine has fine, ripe fruit, flavors of cinnamon and almonds, as well as the structured edge of apple skins and lime. It's still young, needing time for the structure to soften, but already impressively complex.",Ivoire & Ebène Premier Cru Brut,92,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Aubry
126455,US,"The assemblage includes seven grapes from ten vineyards and six AVAs. It needs breathing time, perhaps because of the jumble of components, but with plenty of air it sorts itself out into a luscious and tangy berry and cherry-powered wine. The barrels add lush notes of mocha, caramel and baking spice, with just a hint of alcoholic heat.",,92,50.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Cabernet Sauvignon,Boudreaux Cellars

126457,New Zealand,"Larry McKenna continues to show his masterful touch with Martinborough Pinot with his latest release.

126458,US,"Io has a really good track record with this Syrah, which is grown in Paso Robles. The '06 is intricately structured, a dry wine with complex flavors of blackberries, currants, dates, mocha, leather, grilled meat, pepper and vanilla. Hard to resist drinking it now, but it should evolve in interesting ways over the next six years.",Ryan Road Vineyard,92,48.0,California,San Luis Obispo County,Central Coast,Syrah,Io

126460,US,"Tasted in May, this Grenache-based Rhône blend was still overwhelmingly vibrant and fresh in grapey, primary fruit raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors. It's appealing, but really needs some time to settle down and mellow, so the fruit and oak can mesh together. By the summer of 2009, it should be a wonderful wine, retaining its balanced lushness through at least 2012.",Williamson-Doré Vineyard Cuvée Jeanne Marie,92,35.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,Foxen
126461,US,"This best-of-barrels reserve shows a richness and complexity that make for compelling drinking. A mixture of several clones and selections of Pinot Noir, the wine has firm tannins, but the burst of cherries, red currants, root beer and sweet smoky oak gives it a supple, mouth-filling quality. Delicious now with decanting, and should hold and improve through 2012.",Cuvée Sandra,92,75.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Demetria
126462,US,"A beautiful evocation of Washington fruit, it has concentration, balance and structure, and the clean berry/cherry fruit is amplified by polished tannins, bright acids and light splashes of peppery spice.

This is for food.",Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Brut,92,72.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Pehu-Simonet
126464,US,"100% Cabernet, this is very smooth and supple, a lovely wine, with darker, earthier flavors underneath the opening fruit. It shows the kind of elegance and grace one finds in Bordeaux, without intrusive barrel influences, and it's the kind of nose you want to bury your nose in. It wraps around you seductively, with an appealing shyness. The fruit and wood and earth flavors are seamless and interesting, as the wine leads you gently through a very long finish.",,92,30.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stephenson Cellars
126465,US,"Swanson has a great track record with this wine, which is always in need of time on release. The 2005 shows classic Napa structure, with hard but near-perfect tannins and lush, oak-sweetened black currant, cherry and dark chocolate flavors. Brilliant, but will benefit from a good three or four years in the cellar. Should evolve well beyond 2012.",Alexis,92,75.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Swanson
126466,US,"Where Rusack's regular '06 Syrah is a delicious wine to drink now, this reserve-style bottling is considerably more tannic, as well as deeper-flavored. It's very rich in dark chocolate, red currants, anise, orange zest and pepper-spice, a wine that impresses for its sheer power, but it really will benefit from aging.

126468,US,"This is a young wine that needs cellaring to come around. Right now, it's tough in tannins, and the fruit is direct and primary. It really needs the alchemy of time for the wood, acids, tannins and flavors to come around.

126469,US,"This new vintage of Novelty Hill's estate Chardonnay shows more acid and spice than the slightly richer, creamier 2005, but offers the same superb winemaking. The fruit is a perfect mix of apple, pear, passion fruit and green banana, laced with cinnamon and sweet baking spices. This is that all-too-rare, affordably-priced domestic Chardonnay. It does not require food to “fill in” what's missing—nothing is missing!",Stillwater Creek Vineyard,92,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Novelty Hill
126470,US,"Craig's Howell Mountain Cab typically is powerful and ripe, with bigtime tannins that require aging. The 2005 is such a wine. Made with a drop of Merlot, it shows black cherry and cassis fruit accented with lots of toasty new oak. But it's really young, stinging the palate with astringency. Should negotiate the next 10 years with ease.",,92,80.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Craig

126472,US,"This was one of the best Rieslings of the year last vintage, and the '07 is even better. It's absolutely dry and superbly racy. Acidity, at .82, is one of the highest I've seen in years. Balancing that is a broad, complex array of citrus, peach, apple, flower, petrol, mineral and spice flavors. If California Riesling is making a comeback, it's because of wines like this.",The Shell Mound,92,24.0,California,Marin County,North Coast,Riesling,Pey-Marin

126474,France,"This young vintage is outside the usual Grande Année range of vintages. Bollinger sees the unique heat of 2003 as a reason to make a special vintage for release early. The wine is rich, but being Bollinger, the richness has translated into the full character of the house style. It is relatively dry, packed with white fruits. Not for aging. Drink now.",2003 by Bollinger Brut,92,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Bollinger
126475,US,"Frazier breaks the triple-digit price barrier with this Cabernet. Like their regular '05, it's a very tannic wine, not suitable for drinking now or possibly anytime soon. But it's clearly powerful and concentrated in flavor, with a dense layering of cassis and freshly-crushed blackberries. Totally dry, but a little high in alcohol, it should reward cellaring over the next eight years.",Memento,92,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frazier
126476,US,"Perhaps because the winery's co-owner, Frank Ostini, is a restaurateur, he makes his wines in a forward, approachable style that doesn't require aging, although they're balanced enough for the cellar. The '06 Rio Vista is a fresh, silky wine whose smoky cherry and pepperspice flavors will soar with a grilled steak. Should hold nicely for six years.",Rio Vista Vineyard,92,42.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Hitching Post
126477,France,"If this seems soft at first, that's the year. Soon enough, the hallmark Gosset acidity and minerality show through, with the addition of spicy pear and some toast.

126478,US,"Ungainly now, with upfront, edgy tannins that interfere with the enjoyment of this wine, making it feel hard and astringent. However, there's a wealth of well-ripened cassis, bitter chocolate, cedar and anise flavors that are so powerful, the wine should easily ride out midterm aging.

Not a lot of complexity or angles to ponder, but the wine's fruit content and mouthfeel are both more than good for the price.",,87,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Lamadrid
126539,US,"This is a big, very fruity Syrah. It's almost over the top, blasting the palate with blackberry and cherry jam, blueberry tart, black currant and chocolate flavors. But then the tannins kick in, offering structural balance. Drink now.",Lot 144,87,13.0,California,Los Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Syrah,Cameron Hughes
126540,US,"Vibrant and youthful, this wine greets the taster with fresh, clean scents of honey, fall flowers and roses. It's medium-bodied and crisp, with a final peach note that fades a bit too quickly. Try with Thai curry. No improvement with age; drink before 2011.",The Professors' Classic Dry,83,18.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Gewürztraminer,Cascata
126541,US,"Lots of good Zinfandel flavors of wild berries, currants and spices, and the tannins are just fine. On the downside is a certain vegetal streak that shows strongly in the finish.",Estate,83,54.0,California,Suisun Valley,North Coast,Zinfandel,Vezer Family Vineyard
126542,Argentina,"Jammy and dark, with sweet, candied, offbeat aromas. Heavy in the mouth, with baked plum and berry flavors and then a reduced, short finish. Thick almost to the point of cloying. A strange wine.",Cuma,83,13.0,Other,Cafayate,,Malbec,Michel Torino
126543,Argentina,"Granular, semitart aromas are pasty and soupy, while the palate is warm and round but tastes like sugary, artificial berry and cherry fruit. Sweet and a little chocolaty on the finish. A candied, rudimentary wine that isn't all bad.",Palo Negro,83,8.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Reyter
126544,Argentina,"Tough, rubbery aromas include notes of carob and leather. The palate has a decent, regular feel to it along with hot flavors of baked fruits and chocolate.

126548,US,"A simple Chardonnay whose overdose of French oak does little to enhance the thin, reedy flavors of citrus fruits. The wine, which is nicely crisp and dry, would be better unoaked.",Amourette,83,38.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williamson Wines
126549,US,"Dry and acidic, with very little fruit flavor, although it's clean and elegantly structured. Tastes like generically alcoholic white wine with a few drops of lemon and lime juice.",Clements Ridge Vineyard,83,20.0,California,California,California Other,Chardonnay,Vine Hill

126551,Chile,"Opens with generic red fruit and candy aromas, but the palate is overtly acidic, which causes a sourness to go with candied, medicinal berry fruit flavors. After the tartness subsides, there's regular red fruit notes left over.",Barrel Select Reserve,83,12.0,Cachapoal Valley,,,Carmenère,Santa Ema
126552,Chile,"A light, tropical wine with mango and banana aromas. The palate is limited in feel but not unpleasant, while the flavors are light and tilt toward lychee and melon. Simple, but acceptable in a good way.",,83,10.0,Curicó Valley,,,Chardonnay,Carma

126554,US,"Opens with a spicy nose of raspberry, Christmas cake and plum pudding. There isn't a lot of ripeness or concentration on the palate but this is a very likeable wine that is crisp, elegant and light on its feet. There's only a gentle dusting of tannins, making it a suitable partner for heartier varieties of fish. Drink up before 2012.",Martini Family Vineyard,83,19.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Lemberger,Red Tail Ridge

126563,US,"This vineyard has proven it can ripen good Malbec, but here it seems as if something has gone sideways.

126564,Chile,"Smells meaty and leathery, and later sort of gritty and acrid. The palate is reticent and dry, with short, raisiny flavors that have a brown sugar sweetness at the center. Not awful but baked and boring.",,83,10.0,Central Valley,,,Carmenère,Terrapura

126582,US,"A little raw in acidity, with some green olive notes, but the rustic nature works in favor of the wine, grounding its rich blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors with earthiness.

126583,Spain,"Fresh smelling, with notes of green melon, apple, honey and minerals. It's more simple than complex, with crisp apple and orange flavors and then a chunky, slightly pithy finish.

126586,US,"This estate-grown Pinot Gris has a pleasing delicacy, balancing light citrus with whiffs of pine and a base of pear and cucumber.

126638,New Zealand,"A wine of interesting contrasts, the 2007 Riesling from Omaka Springs takes the strident lime-sherbet and wet-stone notes often associated with dry Rieslings and marries them with an off-dry style. It's medium in body, with those minerally notes helping to balance the sweetness on the finish.",,87,16.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Omaka Springs

There is some black cherry fruit, firm acids, good balance, but it tails off rather quickly.",,87,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Seven Hills
126641,US,"This is light and lightly herbal, an elegant take on the grape, and a good food wine.

126655,France,"Wood-aged Sauvignon Blanc is always a difficult balancing trick. This wine, the top cuvée from Château de Sancerre, doesn't quite make it, with the spicy wood dominating the lighter fruit.

126656,Chile,"Burly aromas of mint, leather, shoe polish, olive and herbs all come together fairly well, and the palate is alive with fruit, especially red cherry and plum.

126661,Italy,"Elegant but gripping, with cherry, violet and leather notes on the nose, followed by a rapberry and rose-infused palate. Black earth and berry notes flavor the long finish.

126666,Australia,"Dark berries or plums, cedar and spice notes sum up the aromas and flavors you can expect from this Heathcote Shiraz. It's medium to full in body, and while it's not overly lush, neither is it overly lean—making it a balanced drink with moderate complexity.

126670,Italy,"Crisp and well-balanced, this Nebbiolo opens with youthful aromas of raspberry parfait and coffee ice cream with sweaty saddle undertones.

Finishes short, without much velocity.",J. Alberto Single Vineyard,88,45.0,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Malbec,Bodega Noemía de Patagonia
126676,Spain,"Aromas of sawdust announce oak, but otherwise the nose is earthy and fairly attractive, with plum and rooty notes.

126678,Spain,"Immediately this strikes you as true Verdejo from Rueda. It has pungency on the nose, with accents of cucumber and celery to the primary passion fruit, apricot and citrus aromas.

126680,Spain,"Incognito deftly describes the unusual beet and blueberry aromas on this wine, which is a bit narrow and scracthy.

126687,Australia,"Made in a mouthfilling, supple style, this cheerful blend is easy to like and easy on the pocketbook.

126699,Chile,"Sort of creamy and unconvincing on the nose, with carob and stemmy berry aromas. The palate runs toward red fruit, but it's also a bit green and herbal. Finishing notes of chocolate and green herbs are typical of Merlot, yet there isn't enough ripe fruit or excitement. Hence, it's a mid-level red wine with some green character.

126721,Argentina,"A conflicted and hence confounding wine. The nose is very oaky, but it's a pointed, almost piercing wood and clove bouquet. The wine is fierce in the mouth, with kicking tannins and acidity pushing bulldozer-like blackberry and bitter espresso flavors. With 6% Merlot, this Patagonian Malbec has its virtues but isn't as friendly as past vintages.",J. Alberto,87,40.0,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Malbec,Bodega Noemía de Patagonia
126722,Italy,"The wine opens with inky, dark concentration and sweet aromas of vanilla, cedar, espresso, hickory and smoked ham from an obviously elaborate oak-aging regime (it sees 12 months of barrique).

126724,US,"Showing the typical character of old vine Alexander Valley Zin, this bottling is rich and powerful in black currant, mocha, gingerbread, anise and vanilla spice flavors that are wrapped into sturdy tannins.

126726,Italy,"This is a modern, powerful interpretation of Sangiovese from Umbria that delivers earthy, leather tones as well as sweet spice and black fruit such as prunes and plums. It's a distinctive, and slightly disjointed wine with a few sharp points and plenty of chocolate spice and cinnamon biscuits in the background. The mouthfeel is big and thick with blueberry flavors and broad nutty tones.",,87,15.0,Central Italy,Umbria,,Sangiovese,Chiorri
126727,Italy,"This is a tight, compact and slightly nervous Sangiovese-Canaiolo blend from Umbria that emits loads of intensity and aromatic energy: Forest berry, blueberries violets, leather, nuts and spicy cinnamon all come to mind. It's an easy wine with a streamlined mouthfeel and a touch of thorny sourness on the finish. The natural acidity would make an excellent companion to most pasta dishes.",Rubesco,87,15.0,Central Italy,Torgiano,,Red Blend,Lungarotti
126728,US,"This may be a Syrah that gains balance with some bottle age, but right now, it's a little obvious and overwhelming in extracted blackberry and cassis fruit.

126730,Chile,"Early exit polls suggest that 2007 is a good year for Chilean rosé. Or maybe it's just that Chile is figuring out how to make rosé after never having made it prior to a year or two ago. Whatever the case, this is perfectly balanced and tasty. The nose is full and flush, with weight but no granular, overripe aromas. And the palate is juicy and pulses with raspberry and plum flavors. Nice and ready to go.",Reserve,87,9.0,Maipo Valley,,,Rosé,Santa Alicia

126732,Argentina,"Lots of heavily toasted oak sits atop the bouquet, and thus it's no surprise that the flavor profile runs a bit lemony and sharp.

Arguably too oaky but with good core qualities.",Famiglia Bianchi,87,18.0,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,Valentin Bianchi
126733,Italy,"A likeable and extremely approachable wine, this Tocai Friulano has a broad aromatic offering with hints of exotic fruit, banana, peach and almond skin.

126739,US,"This is 100% varietal. It has muscle and mass, with tart purple and black fruits wrapped into layers of earth and slightly metallic tannins.

126742,US,"This is a new brand from Gallo, named after a vineyard the Louis M. Martini winery used to designate.

It has thick, dense and chewy tannins.",Uno,87,45.0,Central Italy,Sagrantino di Montefalco,,Sagrantino,Tenuta Alzatura
126746,Hungary,"Weninger already makes impressive Blaufränkisch in Austria, so his endeavors with the same grape in Hungary (named Kekfrankos here) are, not surprisingly, successful. A wave of anise, black pepper and blueberry on the nose, paired with smooth, elegant and structured flavors of the same on the palate, impress. The wine has depth but a dry, poised overall character, which gives it a food-friendly edge.",Spern Steiner,87,45.0,Sopron,,,Kekfrankos,Weninger

This is already delicious, but could certainly age over several years.",Vintage Rosé Brut,92,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin
126759,France,"Taittinger's delicate, elegant style shows well in this beautifully balanced rosé. It moves towards very dry, giving flavors that are of pink grapefruit, along with toast and hazelnuts.

126760,US,"Winemaker Tim Stevens' dark, subtle, beautifully proportioned wines glide across the palate like Apollo Ono dancing with the stars.

126801,Italy,This is a mineral-driven sparkler with a dusty quality that keeps the nose clean and simple. Those ashen notes give the wine a direct linear character and the texture in the mouth is very thin and streamlined.,Argeo Brut,86,15.0,Veneto,Prosecco del Veneto,,Prosecco,Ruggeri & C.
126802,Argentina,"The wine is called 40 Barrels and every bit of those barrels is crawling on this Malbec-Cab blend. For starters, it smells more like hickory than fruit. Soon blackberry and prune aromas and flavors get into the game, but even then the back palate and finish are resiny. Some citric acidity in the center keeps it keen but raises questions about balance.",Magdalena Toso Limited 40 Barrels,86,100.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon,Pascual Toso
126803,Spain,"Almond, sherry and banana aromas start it out. The palate is mellow and smooth, with apple and touches of lemon.

126807,US,"A nice, easy-drinking Cab Franc that shows the variety's cherry flavors and Paso Robles' way of making Bordeaux reds so soft. You'll find added notes of melted milk chocolate and toasty cedar wood.",,85,,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Franc,Christian Lazo
126808,Spain,"Tan in color, with short flashes of apple and spice on the bouquet. The palate has a small level of oxidation, while the mouthfeel benefits from smooth but present acidity. Limited in scope and flavor, but solid for a wine that's beginning to fade.",Gran Vinum,85,24.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Adegas Gran Vinum
126809,Argentina,"Slightly tart and like rhubarb at first, but if given some time this blend of Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet sweetens and becomes more friendly.

126810,US,"Here's one of the more versatile white wines out there, something you can serve with almost anything and be confident.

126811,US,"Here's an extraordinarily rich, flavorful red wine and here's how you should use it. Take a slab of beef, give it a super spice rub, then grill it, maybe with some veggies, and enjoy. Nothing complicated here, just loads of fresh fruits, currants and spices, wrapped into sturdy tannins.",Red Rex,87,28.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Deerfield
126812,France,"Like a Rubens nude, this wine is fat and round, but somehow quite appealing, with layers of plump, ripe fruit and a luxurious texture.

126821,Chile,"Give it air time and it'll give back floral raspberry and cherry aromas in front of a racy, forward-style palate that's got cherry and red plum flavors and integrated spice.

126822,Chile,"Big, burly, medicinal aromas get it going, and there's no shortage of creamy, spicy oak as well.

126824,US,"Compare this with the winery's 2005 bottling (they were co-released for some reason), and you get a good example of vintage variation.

126832,Chile,"Dry and cheesy-smelling at first, then more toasty. The palate struggles to present clean, linear, integrated fruit, oak and earth. Instead, it's rather murky and buttery, the latter characteristic a reflection of the oak the wine rested in. Ultimately it's more about oak and earth than fruit and harmony.",San Lorenzo Estate,86,28.0,Maipo Valley,,,Red Blend,Chono
126833,Argentina,"Heavy, inky and seemingly a bit overripe, with grassy, doughy, cake-like aromas. The palate is simple and soft, and it comes with deep berry, candy and herbal flavors.

126836,US,"A little more tannic, dry and robust than your typically soft, cult-style Napa Cab. You could call it old-fashioned, with its blackberry and cedar flavors and brisk structure.

126842,US,"From one of the Russian River's premier Sauvignon Blanc producers, although recent vintages have slipped in quality.

126848,US,"This will now be a regular offering from Patit Creek. It has black cherry fruit, laced with iron filings and light streaks of tobacco and coffee.

126893,US,"There's a suppleness to the way oak envelops the ripe, plummy aromas on this Finger Lakes Merlot. The palate is dry, but ripe and lush with an intensely concentrated dose of fruit. Low in acidity and tannins, it's a bit plush, but makes for easy sipping with food or on its own.",,86,19.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Merlot,Keuka Spring
126894,US,"Tight and dry in tannins now, with an astringent mouthfeel that feels like sandpaper. So is it an ager?

126896,New Zealand,"A lightweight, silky Pinot Noir for early consumption, Lawson's 2007 features pretty red fruit shadings and delicately herbal notes, elegantly intertwined.

126900,Italy,"Here's an oak-driven Sauvignon Blanc from the 2004 vintage with a thick layer of toast, nut and campfire that play a leading role and leave little room for the wine's natural fruit and floral tones. Those carpentry notes also dominate the mouthfeel and add a piquant touch of exotic spice on the close. That said, this white wine has held very well over the years.",Ronco del Re,87,55.0,Central Italy,Forlì,,Sauvignon Blanc,Castelluccio
126901,Chile,"Starts with intense black-fruit aromas and dark, smoky accents as well as baked berries, licorice and meat. In the mouth, it's a bit clumsy and amped up, with big tannins, extract and a mouthfeel that grabs. Flavors of berry fruit and mint are good, while the finish bounces toward a loud finish. Not what you'd call an elegant wine; it's more about ripeness, power and extract.",Terrunyo Rocahue Vineyard Block: 34,87,41.0,Peumo,,,Syrah,Concha y Toro
126902,Chile,"Quite a tropical style, but it works. The bouquet is ethereal and light, with tangerine and mango aromas that lead to peach and mango flavors.

126903,US,"Good, but feels tartly acidic and unintegrated now, with buttery new oak sticking out, and plenty of jammy sour cherry and red currant fruit.

126911,Australia,"Shows a dark, savory side of Shiraz in its aromas of blueberries, blackberries and black olives, then adds some espresso-like notes on the palate.

126915,Chile,"Mildly herbal black-fruit aromas carry notes of tea and bell pepper, but it's not decidedly vegetal.

126916,US,"This new, nonvintage version of McCrea's Cotes du Rhône-style blend is an interesting wine, with far more complexity than most inexpensive red blends from Washington.

126920,Chile,"Apple and pear aromas are elevated by a whiff of toast, while the tropical palate is weighty but propped up by solid acids.

126921,US,"Aged in barrel (mostly new) for 22 months, this 84% Merlot/16% Cabernet Sauvignon really shows the new oak and vanilla scents and flavors, but that is to be expected at this stage of the game.

126923,US,"The aging in 40% American oak shows in a somewhat pickley note; this still seems to be a bit disjointed, although it's been in bottle almost a full year. It's 100% Cabernet Sauvignon; along with clear varietal character, there are overly strong flavors of bark and herb, and the finish is austere and a little chewy.",,87,34.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Otis Kenyon

Try with grilled pork.",,83,17.0,Virginia,Virginia,,Norton,Cooper Vineyards

126934,US,"Some wines can hit 15.4% alcohol, as this does, and make it work. But here the burn and scorch from the alcohol simply overwhelms some excellent fruit. Detail is lost, and what's left is a hot, jammy red.",,83,25.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Sweet Valley

126943,US,"An uncomfortable wine. It's not quite ripe, showing green flavors and a strong dose of that notorious feline smell that diminishes the citrus fruits. On the plus side is extreme dryness and crisp acidity.",,82,19.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Hawley
126944,US,Give this wine some air to blow off reduced aromas and you'll uncover scents of cotton candy and cherry cough drops.

126945,US,"While ‘claret' is an alternative term for Bordeaux, this wine is based largely on the hardy American variety Norton.

It's sharp and underdeveloped, with tart cherry aromas and piercing acidity.

127077,Italy,"This luminous sparkler offers measured aromas of yellow fruit and honey and delivers a broad, wide approach in the mouth.

127078,Argentina,"Earthy, spicy aromas soon give way to bramble, while the palate gives reasonably sweet but slightly tangy raspberry flavors. Some herbal leafiness enters on the finish, but not in an overbearing way. Good in a modest, basic way.",,85,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Villa Viña
127079,US,"This new release from Waterbrook is a slimmed down version of previous efforts, with rather plain fruit flavors and no discernible new oak influence. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but when Chardonnay is built upon little but simple green apple fruit flavors the grape's lack of character sometimes makes you wish for the return of the good old oaky days.",,85,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Waterbrook
127080,Chile,"Slightly hard, burnt and earthy at first, with dark fruit sitting below that cap. The palate is tannic, thus the mouthfeel clamps down and closes up like a clam. More generous and savory in terms of flavors, with roasted black fruit and aged cheese notes. Narrow and grapey on the finish, but legit.",,86,10.0,Maipo Valley,,,Syrah,Carmen
127081,Italy,"This is a light and fresh blend with well-defined aromas of citrus, peach, green apple and kiwi.

127082,Argentina,"By Belasco de Baquedano, this is a chunky, low-acid Malbec with mint, raisin and slightly damp, earthy undertones.

127085,Argentina,"Rubbery and warm on the nose, with good berry aromas that turn flatter under the microscope. The palate shows sweet, baked berry flavors and brown sugar, while the feel is round, gritty and full of life. Nice for $8.",,86,8.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,La Vuelta
127086,Argentina,"Cola, black cherry and lemony grit mark the bouquet, which is backed by acid-driven, lightly lemony flavors of cherry and raspberry.

127088,Argentina,"This is a straightforward, regular Cab with berry/cherry aromas and flavors.

127095,Italy,"This well saturated rosé opens with a dark pink, almost ruby color and offers aromas of red fruit and forest berry that are not particularly intense. The neutral nose suits the wine fine because it makes up for it with a thick, smooth mouthfeel and ripe berry flavors.",Venas Rosato,86,8.0,Southern Italy,Terra degli Osci,,Rosé,Cantine Cipressi
127096,Chile,"Definitely a dark wine with heavy concentration. Aromas are foresty and rich, but also soft and soupy. The palate is quite heavy and full, with reduced black fruit and herbal flavors. So ripe that prune and raisin come up on the finish. Has its merits but also a few balance issues.",Don Maximiano Estate Single Vineyard,86,21.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Carmenère,Errazuriz
127097,Italy,"This rosé offers aromas of berry fruit, beet root and a touch of exotic spice.

127098,France,"A lovely Sauv Blanc nose with pretty floral notes dancing among aromas and flavors of ripe tropical fruit, peach and tangerine oil. Light weight with good acidity and a clean finish.

127102,Argentina,"A chunky wine with a full, round, sweet, tropical outlook. The nose settles on pineapple chunks, while the creamy palate features flavors of baked yellow apple and melon. Finishes upright, which is better than many. Not sophisticated but still good for Argentina.",Reserve,86,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Cruz Alta
127103,Argentina,"A nice, regular sort of Malbec for everyday drinking. The nose is familiar, with basic berry aromas that have some sharpness, while the palate is solid if a bit tangy, with lively cherry flavors. Juicy and fresh, although slightly angular in feel. Ages only three months in oak, hence the fruit-forwardness.",Estate Bottled,86,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Dante Robino
127104,US,"A well-made wine with a creamy texture and long finish, infused with aromas and flavors of buttered toast, grilled peaches, apple skins and almond shells.

127105,US,"This is a Cabernet to drink now. It's soft and clean and pleasantly complex, with black cherry, currant, cola, spice and sandalwood flavors, and is thoroughly dry. It will go downhill quickly, though, so open on buying.",,86,45.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cass

127107,Chile,"Potent and earthy, with a good set of dark fruit aromas, plus tar, horse hide and peanuts on the nose. That all may sound wild and funky, but it settles down and offers nicely roasted berry flavors, a chewy body and finally olive and herbs on the finish.",Reserva,86,12.0,Rapel Valley,,,Carmenère,Agustinos

127109,US,"A good, somewhat common wine that displays lots of rich fruit, but also the fundamental weaknesses that Sangiovese displays in California. The wine is dry and medium-bodied, with cherry, black raspberry, coffee and leather flavors. But it's a bit sharp in acidity and rugged in the mouth.",Pauli Ranch,86,42.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Sangiovese,Muscardini

127111,Italy,"Liquid smoke and toasted elements of roasted hazelnut and cured meat dominate the nose of this modern Barbera d'Alba. There is power and high alcohol here too, coupled by the wine's naturally high acidity that is a bit strong on the palate. Pair this wine with very cheesey foods.",Bric Quercia,87,22.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Tenuta Carretta
127112,Italy,"Ripe notes of raspberry and strawberry come to the forefront and are followed by spice, bramble and distant mineral tones.

127113,New Zealand,"This wine features a unique combination of stone fruit, citrus and chili pepper, making it a treat to pair with piquant dishes like ceviche. It's medium-bodied, but with plenty of freshness and zest on the finish.",Spinyback,87,17.0,Nelson,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Waimea
127114,US,"Nice mix of berry, chocolate and spicy herb flavors, with good persistence. The excellent fruit sources yield an easy-drinking red blend that stays light and fruity from midpalate on through.",,87,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,Waterbrook
127115,Australia,"Melon and pineapple fruit flavors offer something a little different from other white varieties, and while the wine is full and round in the mouth, it remains focused on the finish, a touch of honey balanced by citrusy notes. Drink now.",,87,14.0,South Australia,Adelaide,,Viognier,Shoofly
127116,Australia,"Pinot Gris is trendy in Australia, which to date hasn't meant great things in terms of home-grown quality. This is a pretty good example, offering a broad, thick texture balanced on the finish by peppery spice, while melon and apricot flavors carry the midpalate. Drink it over the next 6–9 months.",,87,16.0,South Australia,Adelaide Hills,,Pinot Gris,Sidewood
127117,US,"Could be drier and more minerally, because the lemongrass, gooseberry and wildflower flavors finish jammy-sweet. But ultracrisp acidity helps to balance, and the ultimate impact of this wine is mouth-cleansing and steely.",,87,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Twomey
127118,Italy,"Buoyant berry notes jump out of the glass in a very direct and vertical manner. You'll recognize aromas of black cherry, red apple and cassis berry. But there's also a slight notes of nut or spice at the back followed by soft, sweet fruit flavors.",,87,,Piedmont,Barbera del Monferrato Superiore,,Barbera,Silvio Morando
127119,South Africa,"With a confectioned finish and sweet mocha notes on the nose, this might have seen a little too much wood in its 16 months in new French oak. Lovely notes of small red berries, sous bois and pepper appear in the bouquet, while sanguine notes overpower the soft mouth. Overall, it's easy to drink but a little disjointed.",Solms Hegewisch,87,40.0,Western Cape,,,Shiraz,Solms-Delta
127120,US,"Eight vineyards and six grapes go into this table red; in some vintages this hits the mark, as it does here.

127121,Chile,"Slightly leafy and damp on the nose, but dense. The palate is solid, with dark cherry and raspberry flavors along with herbal, drying notes and a touch of late bitterness.

127122,US,"Made in a food-friendly fashion, this Chard is dry, acidic and minerally. It was obviously picked at lower ripeness, but still shows a warm core of pineapples and green apples.

127123,US,"Angel Vine (formerly Three Angels) now offers three single vineyard Zins as well as this blend, with includes Primitivo and Petite Sirah.

127125,Italy,"Here's an exceedingly friendly and approachable Barbera d'Asti Superiore with compact and clean aromas of mineral, tart fruit, hazelnuts and wild mushroom.

127126,US,"Quite a nice Merlot, and it's even nicer when you see the everyday price. Dry and balanced, it shows rich cherry, red currant and sandalwood flavors, with some bitterness that a juicy char-broiled steak will easily conquer.",,87,15.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Merlot,Maddalena
127127,US,"Good raspberry, cherry, orange tea, Dr. Pepper and Asian spice flavors in this wine, brightened with crisp acidity and wrapped into a silky texture. Seems a bit simple and direct though. Probably best in the next few years. From Hop Kiln.",,87,38.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,HKG

127129,Australia,"Bright, crisp and fresh, as a 2009 Clare Riesling should be, this is a pretty wine, blooming on the nose with floral notes, apples and citrus fruit. The lime and green apple flavors are zesty on the finish, but not that long or intense. Probably best from now–2014, but could develop interesting nuances beyond that.",,87,20.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Riesling,Koonowla
127130,US,"This is almost entirely Syrah, done in a high-acid, citrusy style. Flavors are sharply etched and tight—pomegranate, raspberry, baking chocolate and espresso. Straightforward and well-balanced despite its 15% alcohol.",Dark Star,87,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Kana
127131,US,"Quite a nice Cabernet. The grapes got ripe under the mountain sun, contributing blackberry and cherry flavors, while a touch of oak adds caramelized toast. There's a bit too much acidity, which makes the wine sharp. But it's a pretty good job.",Reserve,87,20.0,California,El Dorado,Sierra Foothills,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lava Cap
127132,US,"This includes 8% Merlot in the blend. It's done in a warm, open, generous style, with spicy strawberry and pie cherry fruit.

127133,Italy,"Here's a fresh, simple Barbera with a tiny touch of toasted almond that gives it slightly more complexity and intensity. The mouthfeel is lean and light with a short but satisfying finish.",La Monella,87,,Piedmont,Barbera del Monferrato,,Barbera,Braida di Giacomo Bologna
127134,US,"This is a lush, soft and frankly delicious Pinot Noir that delivers far more quality than most Pinots under $20.

127138,Italy,"Here's a straight-laced Barbera d'Asti (aged in stainless steel) with linear aromas of berry fruit and cherry that appear in a direct and immediate manner.

127139,Italy,"The oak influence here is obvious and does cover some of the natural fruity brightness that is inherent to the Barbera grape.

127143,US,"Though somewhat reductive, with a mix of sweet fruit, tar and rubber ball in the nose, this generous Syrah opens up with juicy flavors of black cherry and loganberry fruit.

127148,Chile,"Spearmint and herbal dark-fruit aromas lend an ominous touch to the bouquet, which isn't followed upon nor improved by the firm raspberry and cherry flavors that control the palate. Black pepper and heat add fire to the finish. Not a big success at this price; the Altum Syrah is much more likable.",Altum Single Vineyard,84,22.0,Curicó Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,TerraMater
127149,US,"Although this Cab is clean and elegant, it's too thin in fruit to be really inspiring. You'll find very modest black currant and cherry flavors, but not enough to cover the 14.4% alcohol, which sticks out and tastes hot.",,84,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,St. Supéry
127150,US,"This is quite dry and tannic, with leafy flavors and a hint of lemon. Some orange peel and spice fills out the midpalate, as the wine breathes and gathers itself.

127151,Chile,"Prepare yourself for a big draping of mocha, coffee and murk on this hot-styled, somewhat funky blend of Syrah and Cab.

127155,US,"It's uncertain how old this “old vine” fruit actually may be. Barrel-fermented in neutral oak puncheons, this is a rather soft, neutral white wine, that could pass for a Trebbiano or something similar.

127167,US,"This wine has flavors of cherries, berries, currants and herbs; it's hard in tannins and very dry. With this rugged mouthfeel, it doesn't seem worth the price.",Red Wine Cuvée,84,48.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,Nord Estate

127171,US,"Feels too soft and rather one-dimensional, although the flavors are very good. The best thing about the wine, aside from dryness, is the richness of tannins.

127172,US,"Pale peach in color, this softly sparkling blend of Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay smells sweetly of red apples and a hint of lanolin.

127188,US,"Despite intriguing notes of ripe red cherries, menthol and barnyard that peek through, tar and smoke from heavily charred French oak dominate both the nose and palate.

127197,Spain,"A bit unusual and confusing, but that's because it hails from the Rioja region. The nose is herbal and mustardy, with green aromas leading to a cidery palate of apples and spice.

127204,Italy,"This oak-aged Sardinian wine opens with awkward aromas of black fruit, pecorino cheese and wild mushroom that blow off after a few seconds.

At its best now.",Perotti Vineyards,87,27.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kokomo
127264,Italy,"Light-bodied and juicy, this is an eminently quaffable Barbera, with loads of bing cherry fruit and a refreshingly fruity but short finish. The open-knit structure makes this easy to partner with flavorful fish. Drink now.",'l Clumbé,87,18.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,,Barbera,Massimiliano Vivalda
127265,US,"A rich, fruity Chardonnay with lots of flavor and bright, mouthwatering acidity.

127266,US,"Spicy and dry, this Zin offers flavors of currants, tobacco, pepper and cocoa. The tannins are thick, but acidity is low, giving it a soft mouthfeel. Could be more concentrated, but it's an elegant wine.",Mustang Springs,87,36.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Peachy Canyon
127267,Spain,"Dark, roasted lead aromas frame secondary baked black fruit and leather scents, while the palate is oaky, stocky and tannic, with creamy, barrel-led berry flavors and more than adequate balance and freshness. Mocha and toast are key finishing notes, and overall it's a nice blend of 85% Garnacha with Syrah.",Garnacha-Syrah,87,12.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Grenache-Syrah,Penelope Sanchez
127268,US,"Rich and bold, but tough in tannins, with a hard astringency to the ripe blackberries, black currants, licorice and dark chocolate. Could age out and mellow in a couple of years, but no guarantees.",Ghielmetti Vineyard,87,60.0,California,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Steven Kent
127269,US,"Shows the high acidity, cherry flavors, silky texture and dryness you expect from this variety. It's not an especially complex wine, but a good, sound one that needs rich oils, cheeses and meats to balance the tartness.",,87,16.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Valley of the Moon
127270,Italy,"Aromas of strawberries, wet stones and hay follow through to a very fresh palate with crisp acidity, little tannin and a diffuse berry character. Quite a nice package, perfect for pizza or lasagna.",Tre Vigne,87,26.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Vietti
127271,US,"The Wolffer Pinot Gris has an attractive, zesty character from the start, with its nose of melon, pear, citrus and spice followed by a fun, lively array of lemon, toast and pear. Pretty and an enjoyable drink on its own, or with delicate foods.",,87,22.0,New York,Long Island,Long Island,Pinot Gris,Wölffer
127272,US,"Youthfully fruity now, with sweet, jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, licorice, vanilla oak and spices. Comes from the warm, southern part of Salinas Valley. Could develop, but it's a gamble.",Reserve Claret,87,55.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Scheid Vineyards
127273,Argentina,"A gritty but well-made wine with aromas of crushed brick, red pepper flake, earth and sandalwood. The palate is tightly wound and mildly tannic, with semisweet flavors of black plum, fig, black cherry and chocolate. Shows a medicinal edge on the finsih, but nothing too drastic.",,87,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Septima
127274,Australia,"A solid effort, the 2007 Chockstone is a balanced, accessible red. There's ample cherry fruit, touches of cedar, vanilla and woodspice and modest tannins. Everything is in proportion, and it should drink well for the next 5-8 years.",Chockstone,87,22.0,Victoria,Grampians,,Shiraz,A.T. Richardson
127275,Argentina,"Dark and saturated to the eye, and powerful on the nose. In the mouth, the flavors of raspberry and plum are solid, while overall the wine is full and stocky but short on complexity and uniqueness. Well executed but highly regular for an upper-shelf Malbec.",Grande Reserve Terroir Selection,87,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alta Vista
127276,US,"This Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petit Verdot and Syrah blend starts with a sultry wave of juicy plum, smoke, pepper and cherry.

A brooding, unfolding wine perfect for a fireside sip.",Red Table Wine,87,21.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Red Blend,Bouké
127277,Spain,"One of Spain's top value-oriented rosés. It's inviting, colorful, easy to understand and tasty. Aromas of fresh fruits and melon get it going, while the palate is clean, fresh, only mildly candied and full of cherry and red plum flavors. Scores high by keeping it simple. Drink ASAP.",,87,8.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Rosé,Borsao
127278,US,"What a wonderful wine for the price. It's dry, elegant and classically structured, and while the cherry, herb, tobacco and oak flavors finish a bit short, this Merlot shows lots of appeal. It's a great by the glass pour.",,87,15.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Chelsea Goldschmidt
127279,Spain,"A clean, almost oceanic opening is fresh and citrusy as it should be, while the palate shows pulse, balance and a little scour to go with orange, grapefruit and other citrusy flavors. Pithy and biting late, with ample fruit throughout.",,87,15.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo-Viura,Esperanza
127280,US,"This is a dependably good, satisfyingly sweet wine from Eberle. The 2008 vintage, with 5.5% residual sugar, is overtly sweet, with good acidity framing savory flavors of tangerine crème brûlée, apricot jam, ripe pear and vanilla custard. Good price for a full bottle of a dessert wine this delicious.",,87,14.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Muscat Canelli,Eberle
127281,US,"Very good, but could be firmer in tannic structure, with a soft, melted mouthfeel. Yet the flavors are delicious, of cherries, raspberries, currants, cola, orange tea, herbs, cinnamon spice and smoky sandalwood. The softness seems to limit ageability.",Peters Vineyard,87,48.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kokomo
127282,US,"Arroyo Seco is an iffy place to grow Pinot or any red wine. Cool and windswept, it needs a warmer vintage, which 2007 wasn't. Rochelle's new bottling is very dry and acidic. It lacks a bit of generosity, in the green mint edge to the cherries. But it's very elegant, with an appealing minerality. Drink now.",Classic Clones,87,40.0,California,Arroyo Seco,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,La Rochelle
127283,US,"This single-vineyard Syrah is dry and elegantly structured. It pleases for its rich mouthfeel and layers of blackberry, currant, licorice, bacon, pepper and cedar flavors. At its best now and for a few more years.",La Rousse Vineyard,87,24.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Forth
127284,US,"An enticing Meritage, with aromas of violet, anise, crushed herbs and red berry fruit followed by deep, savory spice flavors of cinnamon, pepper and cedar. Balanced but full of character, this wine will pair well with meats and poultry dishes.",Flight,87,35.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Meritage,Osprey's Dominion
127285,Argentina,"Quite the woody wine, with aromas of sawmill, cracked pepper, black licorice and dark fruit. The palate has a healthy feel to it, with integrated acidity that props up the oak-infused wild berry and herb flavors that dominate. Finishes with another wave of spicy, raw oak.",Barrancas Vineyards Reserve,87,24.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Pascual Toso
127286,Italy,"This Nebbiolo by Mario Pelassa is loaded with aromas that recall Christmas spice, chopped mint and nutmeg. There's an incredibly strong balsam note here that resembles eucalyptus and peppermint. Pair this wine with lamb and mint jelly.",Antaniolo,87,28.0,Piedmont,Roero,,Nebbiolo,Pelassa
127287,Italy,"Here's a pretty Barbera d'Alba with cheerful aromas of blackberry, sweet spice and cinnamon. The wine is soft, round and smooth and that touch of sweetness on the close makes it a good candidate for roast tomatoes with chèvre chaud.",,87,14.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Pelassa
127288,US,"It was probably the vintage, which was less than spectacular, but this wine, while a good, elegantly structured Cabernet, doesn't justify its price. It's bone dry and tannic, with flavorful blackberries, black currants, minerals and oak. A fine wine to drink with upscale fare, but the sharp finish suggests against aging.",Home Ranch,87,75.0,California,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Steven Kent
127289,Italy,"Sleek and focused, with well-defined cherry fruit and red flower notes. The full-bodied palate is tightly wound with accents of orange peel and black cherry. The finish drops a bit short. Drink over the next few years with flavorful pork dishes.",Valmaggiore,87,61.0,Piedmont,Nebbiolo d'Alba,,Nebbiolo,Sandrone
127290,Italy,"Peach blossom, pear, citrus and loads of honey make up the cheerful nose of this easy and approachable Pinot Grigio sold in a funky blue bottle. This is precisely the kind of no-fuss Italian white you'll want for informal occasions. It has deep honey-driven flavors and a flatter, broader mouthfeel that denotes slightly more structure than your run-of-the-mill Grigio.",,86,12.0,Northeastern Italy,Delle Venezie,,Pinot Grigio,Solemar
127291,US,"A little ungainly now, this Bordeaux-style blend is dominated by fierce tannins. Nothing has integrated yet. The oak sticks out over here, the very ripe black currant and cherry fruit over there. A potential problem is the sugary sweetness that causes imbalance. As this wine ages, something slight now may turn out to be huge later.",Elivette,86,90.0,California,Napa,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Spring Mountain Vineyard
127292,Italy,"Here's a fresher, more youthful approach to Tocai Friulano with crisp notes of exotic fruit, acacia flower and citrus. Those spring flower notes add a very attractive dimension to the wine and the variety's natural structure helps carry those crisp favors to the finish.",,86,,Northeastern Italy,Isonzo del Friuli,,Tocai Friulano,Tenuta Luisa

127294,Australia,"This is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon (65%), with smaller amounts of Shiraz, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. The result is a black cherry- and cassis-scented wine that also shows plenty of cedar and tobacco character. Finishes with some crisp acids that impart an edgy character to the otherwise soft tannins.",Bells & Whistles,86,19.0,South Australia,Limestone Coast,,Red Blend,St Mary's
127295,Italy,"Opens with a pretty shade of gold that denotes more sophisticated extraction and in fact that impression is carried through to the nose and mouth where the wine exhibits ripe fruity aromas, honey, almond skin, dried herbs and natural rubber. The mouthfeel is thin, but remains a step above the commercial Pinot Grigio that is so commonly available. The wine is packaged with a real vine clipping around the bottle neck.",Pinot Grigio,86,15.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,Pinot Grigio,Mosolo Gleni
127296,New Zealand,"A rare disappointment from Saint Clair—and it's still a good wine, just not up the standards set by the winery's other reserve wines. Ripe, peachy fruit is not so much framed by oak as covered by it, starting and finishing with layers of buttered toast and vanilla.",Omaka Reserve,86,27.0,Marlborough,,,Chardonnay,Saint Clair
127297,Chile,"After years of taking its Merlot from southerly Lontué, San Pedro is now using Cachapoal fruit for this everyday wine, and the result seems fruitier and wider than in the past, with aromas of charcoal and herbs setting up black-fruit flavors accented by carob. A full and simple wine that has what it takes to please.",Castillo de Molina Reserva,86,12.0,Cachapoal Valley,,,Merlot,San Pedro
127298,US,"A Rhône blend from the cool Central Coast, this dry wine shows peppery flavors of blackberries, rhubarb and toast.

It's an easy wine to toss back with everyday fare.",,86,14.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Syrah,Domaine de la Terre Rouge
127301,US,"This is a pretty late release for such an inexpensive wine, but its hard, reductive shell may be the reason it's been held back for so long. Herbs and spices drift up from the glass, along with peppery raspberry fruit. But overall it's a tough nut to crack, and should be decanted well in advance.",,86,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Chateau Ste. Michelle
127302,US,"This is roughly 50-50 Cabernet and Merlot. The challenge for the Clore designate is to establish a specific personality apart from the winery's many other superpremium red blends. This seems like a rather ordinary wine. It's sound and good, but does not rise to a higher level.",Walter Clore Private Reserve Red Wine,86,44.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Columbia Crest
127303,US,"Except for some excessive sharpness in the finish, this is a lush, opulent young Cab. It shows ripe cassis, chocolate and oak flavors wrapped into firm, sweet tannins. That sharpness may limit ageability.",,86,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Maple Lane
127304,New Zealand,"At 13% alcohol, this dry-styled Riesling comes across as a bit chunky and lacking elegance. That said, it does offer plenty of poached apple, honey and spice aromas and flavors and a lingering finish.",Icon,86,22.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,House of Nobilo
127305,Chile,"Grassy and green-smelling, with hints of asparagus, green tobacco and sea air. This is true cool-climate white wine, and it shows its proximity to the ocean via aromas of green bean, asparagus and citrus. It's lean as can be, and tight as a drum. It's a terroir wine that has good freshness but could benefit from slightly more amplified fruit.",Reserva Especial,86,20.0,Limarí Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Maycas del Limari
127306,Argentina,"Plenty of smoky oak on the nose, which leads to a mildly lactic influence on the palate. Other than that minor flaw, the wine settles to show resiny black fruit, firm tannins and a finish of vanilla and mocha. Grabby and extracted, but like so many Argentine Malbecs from 2005, it lacks the exuberant flavors and cushioned body that has made the categeory what it is today.",Q,86,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Zuccardi
127307,US,"Veteran winery Taft Street has crafted a gentle, easy-drinking Pinot from the cool Sonoma Coast appellation.

127308,Argentina,"With a hint of prune to the nose and some cheesy oak, the red flags go up. But in the mouth, the wine shows good berry and cassis flavors and admirable depth and length. Finishing notes of cassis and blackberry give it a good send-off. By no means exceptional but by all means a likable though slightly generic Cabernet.",,86,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pannotia Vineyards
127309,US,"Spann is building a decent track record with their Chardonnay-Viognier blend. The wine is very ripe and attractive in tropical fruit, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors, and while it's a little on the sweet side, the acidity pulls it back from the brink.",,86,20.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay-Viognier,Spann Vineyards
127310,Chile,"For the budget-minded, this Shiraz has ample spice, pepper, chocolate and fruit. It has a deepness and ripeness that's admirable, and while it's a standard wine that doesn't pick up complexities with airing, what's in the glass is more than satisfactory.",Reserve,86,9.0,Maipo Valley,,,Shiraz,Santa Alicia
127311,Chile,"Smooth on the nose, with some warmer-weather characteristics such as caramel, baked apple, pear and even acacia. The flavor profile includes ripe apple, melon and a bit of citrus, and the finish is sizable and healthy, with decent acidity and carry-over flavors of peach and melon. Good and not too heavy, especially for a Maipo Chardonnay.",Reserve,86,9.0,Maipo Valley,,,Chardonnay,Santa Alicia
127312,Hungary,"Spicy floral notes on the nose lead into crisp, light layers of citrus and pineapple on the palate with this flirty, flavorful white. Delicate with a clean and elegant finish, it's a fun summer wine with style.",Tramini Late Harvest,86,23.0,Hungary,,,Traminer,Bujdosó
127313,Argentina,"A well-oaked wine with some modern touches. It's ripe and ready but not overdone; the flavors are of raspberry and light resin, but not much else. Like many 2005s, this Cab shows a subdued personality and less-than-expressive fruit. It's good and inoffensive, but it doesn't make you take notice.",,86,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Felipe Rutini
127314,Chile,"Clean and lean, with lime-driven aromas leading into a tangy, crisp palate that settles on lemon-lime flavors.

127315,US,"Nicely rich and crisp, this fine Sauvignon Blanc shows smoky, creamy flavors of lemons, limes, green apples, peaches and figs. There's a slightly sweet, honeyed edge of vanilla, but the wine is basically dry.",,86,16.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Sauvignon Blanc,Easton
127316,Hungary,"The lively spice and pepper of Cabernet Franc take center stage in this approachable wine from Hungary, though the nose tends toward slightly green at first pass. On the palate, prominent pepper, sturdy tannins and a plucky wave of red fruit give the wine a kick. Pair with spiced meat or foods with a peppery profile for the best pairing experience.",Kúria Unfiltered,86,75.0,Villány,,,Cabernet Franc,Malatinszky
127317,Italy,"This Sagrantino di Montefalco from a hot vintage is on the ripe side with aromas of mature berry, black fruit, hickory, smoke and beef jerky.

127318,Chile,"Earth and bacon aromas meld into darker and fuller berry notes, while the medium-bodied palate shows solid but generic strawberry and raspberry flavors.

127326,Chile,"Up goes the curtain and out comes an acrid blast of burnt rubber, leather and compost. Frankly speaking, Ventisquero has not shown much of a hand when it comes to Pinot Noir.

127355,Australia,"Banrock Station's 2006 Shiraz is a throwback to the kind of super value Australian wines used to provide with more regularity.

127356,Argentina,"Huge and extracted, with an opaque purple color and a massive, aggressive nose that hints at stewed fruit, sweaty leather, blackberry compote and shoe polish.

127358,US,"Marimar Torres frankly calls the planting of these 2 varieties in her estate vineyard, which had previously been to Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, experimental. Much work needs to be done to perfect them. The wine, as it stands, is dry and acidic and one-dimensional in cherry and currant fruit. It requires greater levels of complexity and nuance.",Don Miguel Vineyard Syrah-Tempraillo,85,32.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Marimar Estate

127360,Australia,"This medium- to full-bodied Shiraz starts off with aromas that suggest cured meats and slightly stewed plums, while the flavors are even meatier, picking up some citrusy notes.

127536,US,"The very high alcohol clearly shows in the peppery, Porty aroma and hot, prickly mouthfeel. The taste is of blackberry and cherry pie filling, coconut macaroon and rum-and-coke. Having said that, it's good in its own way, and barbecue will help.",Sélectionné,84,32.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Syrah,Edward Sellers
127537,US,"Made in the frankly sweet style of a simple, regional German Riesling, this wine benefits from crisp Monterey acids that balance the sugary citrus, vanilla and floral flavors.",,84,12.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Riesling,Mirassou
127538,Chile,"Hits with a subdued perfume of light berries, bramble and mushroom, but turns rather sharp and sheering on the palate. Calling it tangy and racy is almost an understatement; this wine is overtly snappy and acidic, with sharp raspberry flavors and plenty of length and drive due to the strong acidity.",Tobiano,84,18.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Syrah,Kingston Family
127539,Italy,"You'll get fresh aromas of honey, pear, citrus zest and herb but you'll also get some muddled notes at the back that taint the purity of the fruit.

127540,New Zealand,"This vintage of what can be a stellar wine lacks weight and richness. Intense red-fruit flavors are tinged with compost-y mushroomy, fungal notes that come across earthy and bitter. Drink now.",,84,52.0,Moutere,,,Pinot Noir,Neudorf
127541,US,"An improvement over the '03, this Merlot, Cab, Cab Franc and Petite Verdot blend still shows a dry, tannic quality that doesn't provide immediate pleasure.

127545,Chile,"Soft and a bit vegetal on the nose, with canned bean aromas sitting in front of plump melon, banana and bell pepper flavors.

127547,US,"A disappointing sparkler, too powerful in fruity flavor for the delicacy and restraint a good bubbly requires. The structure of acidity and low alcohol is just fine. The problem is that the raspberry, lime and vanilla flavors are overpowering.",L'Homme qui ris,84,28.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Sparkling Blend,McIntyre Vineyards

127549,France,"This is a medium-sweet, pleasing almond and white-fruit flavored wine that, with its low alcohol, makes a good drink by itself. It's a clean, fresh wine, has some good depth of finishing acidity and ripe fruits.",Jovly,84,11.0,Loire Valley,Vouvray,,Chenin Blanc,Caves du Val de France
127550,US,"While this unoaked white wine is dry and crisp in acidity, it's heavy in fruit.

127551,US,"This is a light and (for Viognier) low alcohol style, with somewhat thin fruit flavors of apple and nectarine. It's finished dry and carries through to a pleasant, though rather generic finish.

127557,US,"An ambitious wine that doesn't live up to its reserve status.

127560,US,"There's no oak on this Viognier, so the fruit stands out, and what fruit it is.

Drink now.",,87,24.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Viognier,Rivino
127561,US,"A good rosé, properly dry and crisp, and not too fruity. There are dried herb and tea notes to the raspberries, and a nice spiciness. A little sharp on the finish, but a fine effort.",,87,18.0,California,Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Rosé,Six Sigma Ranch
127562,US,"A good, lusty Zinfandel to toss back with excellent barbecue and roasts.

127565,Australia,"Despite some very ripe fruit flavors and ample (14.5%) alcohol, this full-bodied Shiraz isn't particularly lush. The tannins are rich and velvety, but the acids are elevated and tartness dominates the finish. Drink it over the next several years.",,87,25.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Yangarra Estate Vineyard

127567,US,"A really wonderful wine that's dry and robust and frankly super-drinkable.

Great as a by-the-glass pour.",,87,10.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Red Blend,Road i Red
127568,US,"A tough, rugged, tannic young wine, brisk in acids and pepper, and not showing much opulence now. There's a molten core of blackberries and grilled, meaty leather, leading to a bone dry finish. Should mellow with 1–2 years in the bottle.",De Luxe,87,27.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Manzanita Creek
127569,Spain,"Slightly saucy on the nose, with jammy, baked fruit aromas hinting at cherry and raspberry.

127570,Italy,"A standout at the tasting, the Chiarlo was made to be enjoyed with food. A complex palate offers lime peel mingled with apricot and peach; and there is plenty of acidity that allows the flavors to come through to a fine finish.",,87,18.0,Piedmont,Gavi,,Cortese,Michele Chiarlo
127571,Spain,"Aromas of Christmas spice, pepper and dried fruit fall more into the traditional category than modern, while the palate is snappy, a little lean and delivers strawberry and raspberry fruit with a light buttery oak note. Tight and dry on the finish, but lean. Ready to drink.",Reserva,87,30.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Vargas
127572,Australia,"Aged partly in new American Oak hogsheads and partly in used French Oak barriques, the barrel regime shows in this wine's obvious vanilla and caramel accents to its boysenberry fruit. Supple and creamy in texture before turning crisp on the finish. Drink now.",Single Vineyard,87,30.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Longwood
127573,Italy,The nose is all gardenia and pear enveloped by citrus. The crisp palate doesn't have a great deal of intensity but compensates with very pleasant flavors of pear drop and nettle. Enjoy with fish in a citrus sauce.,,87,20.0,Piedmont,Gavi di Gavi,,Cortese,Bricco dei Guazzi
127574,Australia,"Although based in the Hunter, Brokenwood has reached into South Australia for this Shiraz, which offers lifted, rather perfumed aromas of raspberries and strawberries supported by vanilla underpinnings.

127579,Spain,"Much more fresh and perky than previous years, with grapefruit, nectarine and other citrusy aromas.

Drink now.",,87,18.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Godello,Abad Dom Bueno
127580,US,"Although the winery describes the oak on this wine as neutral, it seems to stick out. The flavors are dominated by buttered toast and vanilla honey.

127581,Argentina,"Mossy and quite woody, and maybe even bretty, but also rich and stout, with concentration.

Finishes surprisingly quick.",Reserva,87,20.0,Other,Neuquén,,Malbec,Valle Perdido
127582,US,"This seductive Cabernet Franc opens up with aromas of cherry, vanilla and spice leading into layers of blackberry, plum, cinnamon and cedar on the palate.

127584,US,"A classic California Gewürz, dry and coastal crisp in acidity. Assaults the palate with citrus, papaya and flowery geranium flavors that are washed with peppery Asian spices of every kind.

127585,US,"This rich Cabernet starts with aromas of vanilla, nutty oak and mocha, unfolding into flavors of ripe red berries, cedar, pepper and toast.

127586,Argentina,"Recent ratings have been consistent for this pricey Malbec-Petit Verdot-Tannat blend.

127593,Chile,"Definitely outside the norm for Chilean Chardonnay. This is distinctly powdery and sweet, with forced oak and banana-like fruit that simply don't come together in a way that impresses.

127595,Argentina,"Less volatile than Layla's other red wines but still a stretch. Stewed cherry and plum flavors work the flat palate, while the finish is more soupy than it should be.

127596,Italy,"On the cusp of acceptability, Tenuta Oliveto delivers a brownish-burgundy-colored Brunello with almost-oxidized notes of resin, tar, raisins and stewed prunes.

It's a massive powerhouse, explosive in black currant, cherry pie, plum, chocolate, anise and cedar flavors that are detailed and precise.

What a superb achievement.",South Face Block Reserve,95,45.0,Oregon,Southern Oregon,Southern Oregon,Syrah,Abacela
127613,Italy,"Gaja's answer to Barolo, Conteisa means “contested” in Piedmontese and refers to the historic feud between the towns of Barolo and La Morra for the shared Cerequio cru. This gorgeous wine is thick and dark with beautiful concentration and sophisticated notes of dark fruit, mineral and exotic spice. The wine is smooth and solid with firm tannins and structure. It will age for 20-plus years.",Conteisa,95,255.0,Piedmont,Langhe,,Nebbiolo,Gaja
127614,Australia,"This stellar wine takes a little time in the glass to show its true class, but once it's properly aerated, the aromas go from rather vague and lifted to plummy and spice laden. In the mouth, it's rich, creamy-textured and lush, offering the flavors of plum pudding without the excessive weight that the words suggest, plus hints of grilled meat. Again, with airing, it gets even better, piling on more red fruit notes and turning more elegant. A great example of Shiraz, but how many people will be able to justify the $25/ounce expenditure?",Hill of Grace,95,625.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,,Shiraz,Henschke
127615,Spain,"A great Priorat, plain and simple. And while we have always liked Les Eres from Joan Simó, this vintage is the best we've tried. The nose is beautiful: coffee, cola, schist, black fruit and herbs rise up. In the mouth, there's strength but restraint; huge black fruit, pulsing tannins and subtleties. Power and precision as well. A brilliant wine that can be drunk now with decanting, or better: hold for another 4–12 years.",Les Eres Vinyes Velles,95,84.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Joan Simó

The vineyard was planted by one of the owners of the fine Cabernet house, Surh Luchtel, and one of the winery's co-owners works at the von Strasser winery.

A Rhône blend (61% Syrah, 34% Grenache, 5% Mourvèdre), it's aromatically captivating, with a fascinating mix of violets and stones. The wine itself seems carved out of rock, its flavors in bas-relief. Intense raspberry and cassis, white pepper, fine length and crystalline acidity.",Steep Creek Ranch Red,94,50.0,Oregon,Columbia Gorge (OR),Oregon Other,Red Blend,Syncline
127798,US,"Refined and beautiful. Made with a splash of Cabernet Franc that gives it a cherry pie filling richness, it's dry and full-bodied, with thick but sweetly ripe tannins framing a Sauvignonesque core of cassis. Finishes with a wonderful, grounding tug of herbs and coffee. A major achievement at this price.",,94,28.0,California,Napa County,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Newton
127799,US,"From the estate, in the Pritchard Hill area of St. Helena which is worthy of its own appellation, comes this densely structured, impressive but young wine. It's massive in fruity extract and new oak, flooding the mouth with soft, ultrarich flavors of blackberries and dark chocolate and a leathery, peppery, grilled meat quality. This is the kind of wine even a non-red wine drinker will be dazzled by, and connoisseurs will appreciate its power and finesse.

127802,US,"There's a profusion of charred oak on the nose and palate, but smoke and tar notes combined with a slightly cooked plum and cherry profile make this hearty Merlot a good match for smoked meats or bacon enhanced meals.

127821,Spain,"Unusual in that this cava hails from the Ribera del Duero region, where red wines are 99.9% of the show.

127822,US,"Although the plush plum and coffee grind flavors combine seductively with hints of bramble and earth in this rustic, full-bodied wine, pervasive notes of char and a stalky, green character make this wine a bit clunky.

127823,US,"This medium-bodied Merlot wafts fragrantly of sweet, cooked black fruits. On the palate as well, the fruit profile is a bit the pruney side.

127830,Chile,"Some may say the foxy, brambly aromas are true to the variety.

127836,Chile,"Raisin and prune aromas indicate a wine at peak or possibly excessive ripeness, depending on your taste.

127837,Chile,"Warm and toasty, with heavy aromas of vanilla and nuts along with a soft, creamy, low-acid palate to match.

127838,South Africa,"Underneath the lively tropical fruit and grassiness, a creamy, smooth undertone balances the whole.

127840,US,"Shows the classic pepper aroma of a fine Northern Rhône wine, and the tannic structure is impressive, but the blackberry and currant fruit flavors finish on the sweet side.

127841,US,"The 20% Cab Franc beefs it up and adds some herbal strength to the tannins. This budget wine is unusual for having a back end.

127848,US,"This is an almost weightless, acidic and lightly peppery white wine that shows vague hints of pale citrus—lime and lemon, and fresh cilantro.

127849,US,"Given a moderate 10 weeks of aging time in American oak barrels, this lightweight Sémillon acquires a bit more impact than the winery's Bare Naked (all-stainless) bottling.

127850,US,"This wine feels a bit awkward in the mouth; the flavors don't quite connect.

127853,US,"This is very tart and juicy, with flavors of crisp apple and unripe blackberry. It seems to have been picked early, or perhaps over cropped; it's not a bad wine by any means but the flavors have not quite ripened to perfection. They are there, but still not fully realized.",,83,24.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Merlot,Cascadia

127855,Chile,"This is a real heavyweight. At 15.4% alcohol it tastes and smells like Port, and it has a flat and chewy palate of raisin, baked black fruit and licorice candy. Basically, there's just no edge or balance to this mammoth, overripe fruit ball.",,83,18.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Peñalolen
127856,Chile,"The color is more orange than salmon, and the aromas don't amount to much. In the mouth, there's sweet, candied orange flavors backed by a creamy, sort of artificial tasting finish.

127859,Chile,"Whereas the 2004 Carmenère from Echeverria was ripe and on the money, this is just the opposite. It's funky and stinky and almost beyond help at first. Later on it settles down to offer gritty intensity but not much balance or focus. Imported by Orvino Imports.",Reserva,83,13.0,Central Valley,,,Carmenère,Echeverria
127860,US,"Brooding black fruit with waves of savory spice start this wine out well. The spicy but juicy black fruit flavors are integrated and soft.

127862,Spain,"Aromas of rubber, smoked beef, syrupy berry and buttery oak are inviting enough, while the palate has edgy acidity that pushes the wine's black cherry element while cutting an obvious oak dosage.

127863,Australia,"Very clean and correct, from the pure aromas of fresh cherries to the medium body and supple tannins.

127864,Australia,"Cooralook is making very good wines at affordable prices, and this Shiraz is in the same vein.

127865,Argentina,"Opens with rich, broad, semiroasted aromas of black fruit, rubber and earth. The palate is basic and mildly tannic, with black plum, baked berry and mild herbal flavors.

Crisp and a good food wine.",Crianza,87,22.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Vallobera
127869,US,"Very dry and sharp in acidity, with a citrusy bite, like a hit of lime. The Cabernet-Merlot flavors are very rich, suggesting blackberries, black cherries and dark chocolate.

127870,Australia,"The aromas of this Shiraz are surprisingly dark; they tend toward the blackberry and cola end of the spectrum, while the flavors are more reminiscent of stewed berries with a touch of cinnamon.

127876,US,"A nice, versatile white wine at the table. It's crisp in acidity and highly aromatic, with flavors of citrus, geranium, green melon, honeysuckle, vanilla and cinnamon.

127878,Spain,"Dark purple in color, with can't-miss aromas of prune and raisin. The palate is predictably soft, with manageable heft but low acidity and thus very soft edges.

127884,Argentina,"Textbook Malbec with a nice, modern package. Solid as you'd expect, with plum/berry aromas, a hint of cherry candy and then a drawn, mildly saucy palate of red fruit.

127886,Italy,"Earth aromas meld with cherry and boysenberry fruit and continue through to the palate, where just the faintest tannic grip peeks through.

127889,US,"Very dry and fairly tannic, with interesting flavors of cherries, currants and licorice, and an earthy-tobacco note. The finish is very peppery. It's a solid, good wine with some extra qualities of elegance and depth.",,86,20.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Syrah,Paraiso Vineyards
127890,US,"From Mia Klein, this is a seriously good Cabernet Sauvignon, even better than the winery's fine 2004. It shows a great balance of ripe tannins and fine acidity, with a judicious application of smoky oak. The flavors, of black currants and ripe mashed black cherries, have complex overtones of dark chocolate, olive tapenade and mushu plum sauce. Gorgeous now, and should age effortlessly for a decade.",,95,70.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Selene
127891,Spain,"We would not have expected anything to match the stellar 2004 San Román, but this newest vintage is up to the task. It's opaque as midnight without a moon, and the nose is a delectable blend of vanilla, spice, hickory, mocha and meaty blackberry. The palate is both magnetic and sly; it pumps black fruit galore, but augments things with controlled chocolate and spice. Finishes a mile long, with cream, intensity and guile. This wine does not mess around. Best from 2010–2016.",San Román,95,67.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Maurodos
127892,Italy,"This excellent Barolo from Ceretto's Bricco Rocche estate represents a perfect marriage between grape and winemaking. The integrity of the fruit is there—plush, round, intense—and is supported by oak-driven notes of vanilla, cinnamon, cigar box and ground ginger. In the mouth, it tastes smooth and supple and offers long-lasting intensity. Drink after 2020.",Bricco Rocche Bricco Rocche,95,230.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Ceretto
127893,US,"Shows a dramatic interpretation of Dry Creek terroir, with intense wild berry, mocha and spice flavors that are so ripe, they veer into currants and grilled blackberries. Entirely dry, the wine is marked by rich, complex tannins. Superb, a great wine, as good as Zinfandel gets. Drink now through 2012.",Bradford Mountain Vineyards,95,40.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Gary Farrell
127894,Italy,"Rocche is a standout wine that offers just about everything you look for in an excellent Barolo. There's power, complexity and personality here that is enhanced by lusciously intense aromas of chocolate, allspice, blackberry, licorice and cola.

127895,US,"Fifty bucks for Petite Sirah? You bet. It's a huge wine, black as midnight, dry and tannic, with amazingly deep, long flavors of currants, Mexican chocolate mole sauce, crême de cassis, sweet old leather, anise, pepper, cinnamon and smoky oak. Has the balanced complexity of a great Napa Cabernet Sauvignon, with Petite Sirah's classic earthiness and depth. This quintessential wine should age for at least a decade.",Barberis Family Vineyard,95,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Petite Sirah,Madrigal
127896,US,"How they manage to make dessert pastry flavors taste dry is a mystery. Whatever the answer is, this utterly delicious wine erupts with pineapple tart, date nut cookie, vanilla-covered orange and spicy mocha latté flavors, yet has no trace of residual sugar. Brilliant acidity makes it all clean and alive.",Brosseau Vineyard,95,39.0,California,Chalone,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Testarossa

Save this one in your cellar.",San Giovanni,94,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Gianfranco Alessandria
127899,Italy,"Lazzarito is an outstanding achievement and a wonderful example of the staying power of Barolo. The wine is redolent of sweet spice, clove, smoked bacon, licorice and roasted almond—in fact, it's almost too much of a good thing.

127900,US,"This is a big, powerfully constructed mountain Cab. Right now, it's noticeable for the impact of the tannins, which are hard and astringent. They complicate the massive black currant, cassis, mineral and cedar flavors. The richness won't go away while you age the wine and wait for some sediment to fall out.

127901,Italy,"Costa Russi (a vineyard purchased by Gaja in 1967) produces a feminine wine with an emphasis on elegance and harmony, rather than power and succulence. Bright red fruit, smoke, cedar, cola and polished mineral notes create a beautiful embroidery of aromas and the wine's firm but composed tannins bring the mouth alive.

127902,Italy,"Luigi Baudana enjoys a long history with the Cerretta cru and that experience has led to extraordinary results.

It has thick, tart tasting tannins and offers loads of Indian spice on the finish.",Cerretta,94,69.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Luigi Baudana
127903,Italy,"Renato Ratti's Rocche expression is a remarkable wine with extraordinary intensity and complexity.

127904,US,"This 100% Cab is a huge wine, an appropriate ambassador from Mount Veeder. It's old-fashioned in its dryness and hard tannins, so unlike today's softly gushy cult Cabs, but that should enable it to age for a long time. Shows a heart of cedar-accented black currants, with exotic cigar box complexities. A serious cellar candidate.

127905,Italy,"Bruno Rocca's well- received Rabajà is extremely generous with soft tones of mature fruit, spice, vanilla, ginger and root beer.

Drink after 2015.",Rabajà,94,100.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Bruno Rocca
127906,Italy,Extraordinary intensity and complexity make this a true standout. The Ovello cru excels in excellent vintages like 2004.

127907,US,"From St. Helena comes this massive Cab, made in the Duckhorn style of intense, hard tannins in its youth. One hundred percent new French oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume.

127908,US,"Actually from the Green Valley, a firm, young, minerally wine, with a flinty tang. There's also tremendous oak influence in the form of smoke, cream and butterscotch, but the richness comes from exotic Meyer lemon, Key lime pie and green apple jam fruit. Brilliant and compelling.",Cresta Ridge Vineyard,94,41.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
127909,Italy,"Il Bricco is a blockbuster wine with extraordinary intensity and impressive concentration. It's a dark, spice-driven wine with oak aromas of vanilla, cinnamon and powdered spice backed by black currants, forest berry, pressed flowers, curry and turmeric.

127910,US,"This wine just oozes class and refinement. Shows lush flavors of blackberries, currants, dark unsweetened chocolate, leather, black licorice and something animal, like the charred edge of a grilled steak.

127923,Chile,"Ripe and forward, with just the smallest hint of green on the nose and palate. The feel is creamy and full, while flavors of black fruit are pleasant.

127973,US,"A little sharp and minty, this Pinot is very dry, with acidic flavors of cherries and cola. The mouthfeel is silky. It's not going anywhere, so drink up.",Keefer Ranch Vineyard,84,48.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pali
127974,Argentina,"Forward and lively but challenged and pithy. The apricot and melon flavors are bolstered by acidity, but the wine tastes more citric and snappy than suave. And the finish also doesn't offer much beyond citrus. Definitely not lifeless but where's the Chardonnay character?",Yauquén,84,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Ruca Malen
127975,Argentina,"A little sharp and ringing on the nose, with pine and citrus keeping it ultra fresh. The palate is mildly aggressive and zesty, with herbal raspberry and cherry flavors. With light oak and acidity kicking all the way to the end, this shows the crisp side of Pinot Noir.",,84,10.0,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Pinot Noir,Alfredo Roca
127976,US,"Lean, herbal and earthy, this is comparable to a basic Bordeaux, but a bit rounder and less tannic. The wine is simple and a bit stripped of flavor, but overall it is balanced and varietal. It offers fair value for the modest price.",Quail Series,84,9.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Covey Run
127977,Australia,"Despite ample weight and concentration, this wine is overtly green and minty, with wintergreen notes riding atop blackberry and blueberry fruit. Finishes tart.",,84,16.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Shiraz,Flinder's Bay
127978,Argentina,"Supposedly Doña Paula's top selection for 2005, and while the wine shows some earthy darkness and plenty of fruit on the bouquet it doesn't follow up with the mouthfeel or overall balance that it should. It's ripe for sure, but also aggressive, with a disjointed acid-to-tannin ratio and an almost syrupy mouthfeel.",Selección de Bodega Single Vineyard,84,35.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Doña Paula
127979,US,"Tastes simple and a bit sweet, a soft, gentle wine offering candied raspberry, currant, licorice, cocoa, pepper and sage flavors. Good with everyday fare, like pizza, burgers, meat loaf.",Buff-Bellied,84,18.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Clos La Chance
127980,US,"This unoaked Chard has a somewhat Chablilsienne quality to it, with a beautiful mineral-driven freshness supported by delicate aromas of white peach, green apple and lively orange citrus. Light and immensely refreshing, it's a perfect apértitif sipper to be enjoyed with cheese and crudité.",Ingle Vineyard Unoaked,86,15.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay,Heron Hill
127981,France,"Starts off with a faint chemical odor that blows off quickly, allowing the more appealing notes of small white flowers, pear and toasted hazlenut to come through. Medium weight in the mouth with a solid, roasty finish. A great choice for barbecue or grilled chicken.",,86,11.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Vin de Pays d'Oc,,Chardonnay,Hob Nob
127982,US,"A useful, dry, fruity Merlot for drinking with almost anything that calls for a full-bodied red. Shows red and black cherry, cola, chocolate and cedar flavors, wrapped into hard tannins. Might gain with a year or two in the bottle.",,86,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Hopper Creek
127983,US,"Nicely balanced with attractive aromas and flavors of ripe stone fruit, lightly charred red apple and limey citrus. The mouth is round and lush but not fat, with moderate acidity keeping the weight in check and leading the way through the medium-length finish. Great for company alongside goat cheese appetizers.",,86,10.0,New York,Cayuga Lake,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay,Hosmer
127984,Italy,This luminous rosé from the Lake Garda area of Northern Italy offers vibrant berry tones backed by slight shadings of white stone and ash. The wine is tonic and clean with a touch of sweetness on the close that could stand up to quiche Lorraine.,Chiaretto,86,13.0,Veneto,Bardolino Classico,,Rosé,Marchesini
127985,France,"Soft and lush, this wine opens with papaya, honey and pear underpinning a spicy top note. It's not quite as complex in the mouth, and noticeably off-dry. A good choice with fruit salad. Drink now.",Rosenberg,86,25.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Domaine Ehrhart
127986,France,"There are plenty of dry tannins here, dominating light red berry and hedgerow fruits. It is never going to be a big wine, but the tannins should soften in a year to leave a fresh, fruity wine.",,86,47.0,Burgundy,Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Jayer-Gilles
127987,France,"An exquisitely pretty wine, with green apple and white cherry fruit shot through with an intriguing cardamon note. The finish is crisp and dry with hints of lemon and Turkish figs. Perfect for warm weather entertaining.",Les Domaniers de Puits Mouret,86,19.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,,Rosé,Domaines Ott
127988,France,"A moderate-weight, citrus-infused Chard with soft green apple and dandelion floral accents. A crisp, clean finish and medium acidity makes this an excellent choice for warm weather sipping.",,86,14.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Vin de Pays d'Oc,,Chardonnay,Domaine de Fonfile
127989,US,"Sweeter smelling than the usual Chard, with peach preserves, lychee, pear and pink florals unfolding in the bouquet. The mouth offers more oak-driven balance, with notes of cedar plank and spiced pears filling the cream-textured mouth. Seals the deal with a lingering, toasty finish.",Reserve,86,18.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Chardonnay,Harbes Family Vineyard
127990,US,"Shows a nice, Alsatian-style balance between off-dry and dry, with crisp acidity framing citrus, pear, vanilla and candied ginger flavors. Clean and zesty, it's a fine cocktail sipper.",Klindt Vineyard Estate Grown,86,17.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Gris,Claudia Springs
127991,Argentina,"Robust up front, with bacony aromas mixed with leather, violet, pickle and blackberry. The palate is crisp and racy, with a fresh, acic-driven profile that's dotted with raspberry and blackberry. Has its share of flare but also some heat and unabsorbed acidity.",Reservado,86,16.0,Mendoza Province,San Carlos,,Malbec,Carlos Basso
127992,US,"Tastes super-jammy and extracted in cherries and raspberries, and pretty oaky, too, with a veneer of vanilla and charred wood. But it somehow lacks the structure to support all this richness. Feels a little flabby, and not likely to age well.",Edna Ranch 1772,86,46.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Tolosa
127993,US,"Ripeness is both this wine's blessing and its challenge. It's super-fruit in jammy blackberries, blueberries, currants and cherries, brightened by that famous Edna Valley acidity. But it's all on the surface, without much complexity. So drink now.",Estate Edna Ranch,86,24.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Tolosa
127994,Italy,"This rosé opens with a bright, saturated pink color and although the nose is rather neutral, the wine does deliver a clean and full texture that could pair with most summer dishes or lightly fried calamari. There's a touch of both sweetness and piquant spice on the close.",Cerasuolo,86,10.0,Central Italy,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Cerasuolo,,Rosé,Talamonti
127995,Chile,"Try as we might to rally around this four-grape blend, things just aren't coming together. The nose is dry, cheesy and loses clarity with exposure to air, and while it's juicy and lively, it's also a common type of wine with high acidity and a spiky feel. The blend is 80% Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc and 20% Carignan and Carmenère.",Suyai,86,40.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Red Blend,Terra Andina
127996,Chile,"Spunky and sweet smelling, with a touch of stemmy pepper to the nose. The palate is narrow but fruity, with your standard allotment of zesty red fruit flavors along with mellow spice. Finishes short, with drying tannins. Good but lacks nuance and sophistication.",Clava,86,13.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Pinot Noir,Quintay
127997,France,"Although this wine is missing the seductive nose of many Gewürztraminers, it is impressive in the mouth with a rich texture and intense notes of rose water and cloves. Slight residual sugar and soft acidity make it a good partner for seafood in a fruit-based preparation.",Réserve,86,21.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Pierre Sparr
127998,Chile,"Starts with young, bouncy, foxy aromas and then settles on berry fruit and bacon fat. The palate is somewhat rooty and sweet, with solid tannins, body and respectable cassis and berry flavors. A sweet wine with adequate richness and reasonably true Cabernet qualities.",Reserva,86,10.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Carolina
127999,US,"Oak sticks out on this Chardonnay, striking with buttered toast, vanilla and wood char notes that dominate the underlying wine, which has perfectly fine citrus and tropical fruit flavors.",,86,28.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Schug
128000,US,"Sweeter, more developed aromas of caramel, candied red apple, Boston baked beans and honeydew develop on the nose, while the mouth shows more typical Chard notes of baked apple and hazelnut butter. A touch round and flabby, but ends with a long, delicious, vanilla-kissed finish.",,86,15.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay,Rooster Hill
128001,Italy,There's a strong note of chopped mint or peppermint that sets this wine apart from most other rosés on the market. The wine is tart and slightly sweet in the mouth and would pair with lamb kebab and mint sauce or hummus and fried pita chips.,Rosato,86,13.0,Southern Italy,Salento,,Rosé,Masseria Altemura
128002,US,"Very tough in tannins now, and bone dry, but it's not showing the richness you want for it to survive time in the cellar. Some modest blackberry flavors, which turn into black currants and cocoa toward the finish, relieve the austerity. But it doesn't seem likely to improve.",Tomasson Vineyard,86,40.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Midsummer Cellars
128003,Chile,"Sweet basic cherry aromas are candied at first and then darker with airing. The palate is bold, juicy, a little aggressive and herbal, with ample berry and plum fruit at the base. Oaky and long on the finish, with a peppery, herbal ending.",Reserva,86,14.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Carmenère,Viu Manent
128004,France,The nose of Concord grapes is immediately appealing and leads to notes of overripe raspberries. Substantial residual sugar in combination with medium acidity render this a good for pool-side sipping or with paté.,Réserve,86,15.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Willm
128005,France,"Soft red apple, white peach and delicate white florals unfold in the nose, while toastier notes of baked apple and brioche appear in the mouth. Round and full, there's not a lot of complexity here but it's straightforward, satisfying and quite easy to drink.",Vignes de Nicole,85,14.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Vin de Pays d'Oc,,Chardonnay-Viognier,Domaines Paul Mas
128006,New Zealand,"A bit of a letdown coming from this producer, the Kidnapper's Vineyard Chardonnay seems to lack some richness and flesh in the midpalate. It's otherwise appealing for its pear, melon and graphite notes and crisp finish.",C3 Kidnappers Vineyard,85,20.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Chardonnay,Craggy Range
128007,Chile,"Fresh and green-fruited, with mildly sweet, talcum powder aromas. Turns more stark in the mouth, and toward sour apple and grapefruit. Fairly acidic, and thus more zesty than substantive. Lemony and sharp on the finish.",Reserva,85,11.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Chono
128008,Chile,"For a huge-volume wine, it's what we'd expect. Controlled oak results in aromas of coffee, vanilla, marshmallow and resin in addition to cassis and cherry, while the palate offers generic fruit flavors as well as vanilla and herbal notes. A bit puckery and scratchy, but keep in mind that annual production tops 1.3 million cases.",Casillero del Diablo Reserve,85,10.0,Central Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Concha y Toro
128009,US,"A good, everyday Pinot Noir. It's somewhat rugged, with jagged tannins, and the flavors are direct and simple, suggesting cherry jam and buttered cinnamon toast. But the silky texture is pure Pinot Noir.",Reserve,85,16.0,California,Sonoma County-Monterey County-Santa Barbara County,California Other,Pinot Noir,Angeline
128010,Australia,"Slightly musky and briny on the nose, with a broad underlay of peach. This medium-bodied Riesling seems lightly honeyed and a little soft relative to its peer group. A user-friendly introduction to Australian Riesling that should be consumed over the next 6–9 months.",Thomas Hyland,86,14.0,South Australia,Adelaide,,Riesling,Penfolds
128011,Italy,Despite its age (the wine is from the 2005 vintage) this Barbera d'Alba is impressively vinous and fresh with bright berry notes backed by some prune and plum nuances. It's tart and chewy in the mouth.,Colbertina,86,25.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Tenuta L'Illuminata
128012,Italy,"Here's a well concentrated Barbera d'Asti with a deep shade of ruby and garnet and vibrant aromas of cola, teabag and fresh forest fruit. The mouthfeel is both drying and crisp at the same time.",Ajan,86,13.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,,Barbera,Villa Giada
128013,Italy,"This bright, young Dolcetto opens with easy berry fruit, cinnamon and a sprinkling of crushed white pepper. The mouthfeel is thin and informal but the wine tastes fresh enough to pair with pasta al forno.",,86,,Piedmont,Dolcetto di Monferrato,,Dolcetto,Terre d'Aleramo
128014,US,"The Tempranillo has an agreeable entry, with pretty violet scents leading into tart raspberry and cherry fruit, amplified with a bit of barrel spice. It loses steam quickly, and the tannins turn chewy and a bit rough, but more bottle age may help smooth it out.",Les Collines Vineyard,86,35.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Tempranillo,Tertulia
128015,US,"Not the most successful Rosella's Pinot ever. The flavors are rich enough, suggesting raspberries, cherries and cola, and the wine is dry and silky. But there's an acidic sharpness, reminiscent of mint jelly, that deranges the palate.",Rosella's Vineyard,86,59.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
128016,Chile,"Herbal and slightly volatile on the nose before it settles on meaty, herbal fruit aromas. The palate stores flavors of cocoa, carob, olive and herbal black fruit, and while it shows some stemminess it ends on a firm plane with herbs, toast, earth and pepper.",Puerto Viejo,86,10.0,Curicó Valley,,,Carmenère,Viña Requingua
128017,Italy,"Here's an easy-going and traditional expression of Barbera that is not overstated or exaggerated in any way. In fact, fruit intensity is measured and the wine presents an informal, no-fuss but elegant front. You'll get aromas of cherry, blackberry and spice.",Ca' del Sarto,86,11.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Palladino
128018,New Zealand,"Best for those who like a strongly leafy side to their Sauvignons, as this wine features plenty of crushed tomato and nettle and only a modicum of tropical fruit in the background. Drink it over the next few months.",,86,14.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Sherwood Estate
128019,Italy,"Here's a fresh, densely concentrated Barbera with a dark purplish hue to its ruby color and bright aromas of blueberry, raspberry and black cherry. There's not much complexity here, but the point of this wine is to be informal and a good partner to home cooked meals.",,86,,Piedmont,Barbera del Monferrato,,Barbera,Silvio Morando
128020,Chile,"Starts out chunky and mulchy before it finds its stride with plum and roasted berry aromas. The palate has a standard, semirich feel and roasted plum and spice flavors. A bit oaky and resiny on the finish, but perfectly drinkable as inexpensive Cabernet goes.",Special Reserve,86,13.0,Maule Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Simone
128021,Italy,"This is a ripe and jammy expression of Barbera d'Asti that offers sweet aromas of blackberry, strawberry and blueberry preserves. All that mature fruit is nicely balanced by bright acidity in the mouth.",Antica Casa,86,13.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,,Barbera,Ricossa
128022,US,"Dry, ripe and exotic. Made from the Musqué clone, it shows melon, lime, mineral and white pepper flavors, with a touch of New Zealand-style gooseberry, brightened with crisp acidity. There are some green, feline notes that will make the wine controversial. Tasted twice.",Hyde Vineyards,86,27.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Selene
128023,Australia,"Possessing bold waves of pineappley fruit, this is an intensely flavored Chardonnay at a reasonable price. It's fruity and direct, with clean citrus featuring prominently from start to finish.",Ass Kisser,86,10.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Chardonnay,Rocland Estate
128024,New Zealand,"Offers what folks have begun to identify as pretty standard Marlborough Sauvignon, combining a struck-flint character upfront with grassy notes, melon and fig fruit and followed by a citrusy finish. Seems a touch soft; drink now.",,86,19.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Saint Clair
128025,Italy,"Here's a powerfully fruit-driven Barbera d'Alba that gives the impression of high alcohol, ripe fruit and oak use. The wine is lush and smooth in the mouth and thanks to the naturally high acidity, it keeps the palate very clean.",Nicolon,86,,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Angelo Negro & Figli
128026,Italy,"Here's a chalky, mineral interpretation of Barbera with drying sensations of granite and slate backed by a delicate impression of wild berry and cassis. The wine is crisp and tonic with a bitter finale that recalls white almond skins.",La Bellalda,86,,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,,Barbera,Ca' dei Mandorli

128028,Italy,"This Barbera d'Asti Superiore offers good value with a thinner, more traditional style that puts emphasis on the liveliness of the fruit found in its bouquet and on the finish.

128030,France,"A creamy style of Sauvignon Blanc, showing soft pear juice and flora flavors, fresh with a feeling of richness. Screwcap.",Sauvignon,86,10.0,Southwest France,Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine du Tariquet
128031,Chile,"Grapey and thick at first, with sweet berry aromas that seem more generic than specific. The palate has some grit and grab, while flavors of plum and berry smack down with bitter herbs and black pepper. More pepper rides the finish along with mocha and coffee.",Reserva,86,13.0,Maipo Valley,,,Carmenère,Chono
128032,South Africa,"Cherry-centric throughout with supporting elements of wild forestry, fennel, sweet spice and blood orange. The acidity is prominent but balanced within the round mouthfeel showing gripping tannins and an overall firm structure. It's approachable now and would pair well with fruit-stewed chicken or pork chops.",,86,11.0,Coastal Region,,,Pinotage,MAN Vintners
128033,Italy,"This young Dolcetto opens with loads of fresh fruit, but there's also a slightly musky smell at the back that gives the wine a touch of complexity. It's an earthy, warm wine with a full and velvety feel.",Fontanazza,86,18.0,Piedmont,Dolcetto d'Alba,,Dolcetto,Marcarini
128034,South Africa,"Here's an earthy, dark red with soft tannins that's perfectly approachable now.

128036,Italy,"This Barbera d'Asti presents an interesting aromatic profile with notes of cherry cola, sweet berry fruit and a touch of red candy. The wine is crisp and tonic in the mouth with a very fresh and acidic finish.",,86,,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,,Barbera,Franco Mondo
128037,Italy,"Warm and inviting, Giacomo Fenocchio's Barbera d'Alba Superiore offers earthy tones of cured meat, white mushroom and dark fruit.

128038,Australia,"Shows some rather riper-than-expected fruit flavors, hinting at peach or nectarine as well as the standard apple and lime. The result seems a touch off-dry, although the actual residual sugar is only 3.5 g/L. Despite being lightweight in the mouth, it turns a bit honeyed and weightier on the finish. Drink it over the next few years.",Hanlin Hill,86,20.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Riesling,Petaluma
128039,US,"Bone dry, with crisp, mouth-cleansing acidity and flavors of citrus fruits, minerals and vanilla. There's a touch of gooseberry and muscat. Turns almost sour toward the finish, but it's zesty and alive.",,86,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Picazo

128048,US,"With high acidity making for a stinging mouthfeel, and 1.3% residual sugar giving some, but not enough, soft relief, the result is a compromise between a sweet and a dry wine, which will satisfy fans of neither.

128068,US,"Accented with intriguing notes of charred oak, dried herbs, porcini mushrooms and a whisper of peppery grains of paradise, this is a rustic Merlot.  The midpalate shows hints of underripe red fruit and raw green peppers, but it's a sturdy dry red that would hold up well with rustic braised meats on a cold winter's night.",Estate,85,19.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Merlot,Raphael

128082,US,"Ledson held this wine back for almost 4 years, but it's still pretty tannic. Shows an astringency that makes your gums numb.

It displays the tannin-acid balance you expect from Anderson Valley Pinot Noir, plus the exceptional intensity of fruit characteristic of the vintage.

128103,US,"This is always a great bottling, and Zaca Mesa's 2006 Black Bear Block goes to the head of the line in newly released California Syrahs. It's an enormously rich wine, filled to the brim with pure blackberries, currants, cocoa and peppery-spiced oak, and the finish turns to milk chocolate. But it's dry.

128104,US,"Here's a big, flashy, cult-style wine if ever there was one. It offers masses of blackberries, black currants, coffee, spices and new oak. Vastly rich, it defines the Harlan Estate style, although, in this vintage, perhaps not quite at its highest expression. Nonetheless the wine is fat and unctuous and immediately drinkable, thanks to refined tannins.

128105,US,"The vineyard is near Occidental, in the cooler southwestern part of the valley, and you can taste the fog and the sea and crisp nights in the acidity, like biting into a Gravenstein apple.

128107,US,"Held back, for some reason, for more than six years, this wine is showing beautifully now.

128108,US,"It's impossible to imagine this wine could have existed even five years ago, even though it hails from the extraordinary Nielson Vineyard that for many years has yielded Byron's best Pinot Noirs, as well as Chardonnays. The ripeness level is something only modern techniques could achieve, and the 2007 vintage was great.

128118,Germany,"This TBA shows an incredible likeness to Earl Grey tea, sweetened with honey and made subtly even more complex through the inclusion of dried stone fruits. It's rich and concentrated, not just sugary, but could use just a tiny bit more acidity to completely balance the finish.

128120,Germany,"Deftly illustrates why auslese is the ripeness level favored by so many cognoscenti, as the wine still retains some flinty, slaty minerality to go along with the layers of ripe fruit.

128122,France,"A dark charactered wine, with solid tannins and firm, extracted fruit flavors. The berry fruits are juicy and sweet, with the dusty tannins coming from the Cabernet in the blend.

Worth aging.",,93,50.0,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Giscours
128125,Italy,"The excellent 2004 vintage shines through in this traditional expression of Brunello. Biond-Santi's wines speak highly of the territory they come from.

128129,US,"An impressive young Bordeaux blend, mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, that shows impeccably ripe, clean fruit but also the hard tannins of its famous mountain.

128130,US,"There was significant variation among three different bottles opened. At best this is a tannic, somewhat reductive wine with light fruit that is overwhelmed by new American oak.

128132,France,"This wine is named after the tufa, limestone rock (pierre in French) which is so typical of the Chinon region. This wine suffers from some vegetal characters, due to the cool year.

128137,US,"With 15.7% alcohol, this Zin is just too hot, more like a spirit than a table wine. The black currant, cherry and chocolate flavors, enriched with sweet new oak, are admirable. But that alcohol sticks out like a sore thumb.",Estate,83,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Zinfandel,Peju
128138,US,"From this inland region east of L.A. comes a Merlot that's simple, hot and flat. Previous vintages have been better, but the heat of '04 took its toll. The wine needs greater concentration of its cherries and blackberries.",,83,22.0,California,Temecula,South Coast,Merlot,Falkner

128146,US,"There's some bitterness along the edges of this wine; the tart, light fruit flavors are outlined in bitter phenolics that detract from the overall mouthfeel. Green apple and plenty of acid is the story here.",,83,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Columbia Winery
128147,Chile,Rhubarb and bramble on the nose give you a clear indication that ripeness and richness will not be forthcoming.

128148,Chile,"Roasted on the nose and seeming ripe due to its dark character; it's disappointing that the palate is so sharp and acidic, neither of which are Carmenère characteristics and thus raise the question of overacidification during winemaking.

128151,US,"The alcohol is nice and low, just 13.3%, but the wine tastes like it has residual sugar, with apricot jam and pineapple jelly flavors. Crisp acidity helps, but it's really too sweet for a table wine.",,82,17.0,California,Temecula,South Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Falkner
128152,US,"This is quite simple, barely hinting at the lush pear flavors of most Northwest Pinot Gris. Thin and generic, it is as neutral as a white can be, with a hard, bitter, grainy finish.",,82,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Pinot Gris,Columbia Winery
128153,Chile,"This Concha y Toro brand almost always delivers good quality for a fair price, but this wine doesn't accomplish much. It smells like a child's fruit drink, and the strawberry and raspberry flavors are equally candied.

128162,Italy,"It took a few minutes to wake the Principessa up; but when she did, there were plenty of bright summer fruit aromas, which seemed to come rushing out as if to make up for lost time.

128164,Italy,"Fontanafredda's Moscato d'Asti is a cut above its competitors, with intense orange, grape and pear aromas that lead into a palate of white grapes and ground cherries.

128171,Italy,"This wine gives the impression of having been pushed just a bit too far, with a nose and palate dominated by vanilla and mocha notes imparted by small oak barrels. Nonetheless, black cherry and strawberry flavors manage to peek through on the palate, supporte by a cushion of lush tannins.

128177,Italy,"Really charming, with a nose of green plums, red berries and earth that jumps out of the glass and curls up in your lap.

It is stylistically in step with the Family Reserve, but in 2005 the fruit may have gotten just a little riper, creating a wine that is close to Russian River status and style.

It's nice to see more screwcaps from Italy, especially on these light, easy wines.",,85,9.0,Northeastern Italy,Delle Venezie,,Pinot Grigio,Villa Pozzi
128235,New Zealand,"It's a bit simple and a bit soft, but this value-priced wine accomplishes its mission of bringing authentic Marlborough SB flavor to the U.S. at an affordable price. Gooseberry and lime flavors are touched with hints of honey and mint, finishing with a bit of sweetness.",,85,10.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Monkey Bay
128236,Australia,"Could this big-boned wine still be tight a few years after the vintage? Or is it just not that impressive? Lime and petrol notes dominate the wine, which finishes dry and tart.",,85,28.0,Victoria,Bendigo,,Riesling,Lamont
128237,Italy,"This Sauvignon is lean in appearance and offers a dim golden color backed by pretty aromas of kiwi, passion fruit, mango and fresh herbs. The nose lacks the sharp highlights usually associated with the variety and is instead flatter, wider and creamier in approach.",,85,16.0,Northeastern Italy,Collio,,Sauvignon,Ronco Blanchis
128238,US,"Not quite as rich and balanced as in past vintages, the 2004 is a bit ordinary in blackberry and cherry flavors. The tannins are fairly powerful, and the wine, which clocks in at over 15% alcohol, feels hot and peppery.",La Maestra,85,50.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ruston
128239,Chile,"Citrus pith, peach pit and other largely neutral aromas define the nose. The palate is soft and a touch flat, with ripe, nonsheering peach and citrus flavors. Midlevel Chilean SB in every way, shape and form. Imported by Racke USA.",,85,11.0,Central Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Espiritu de Chile
128240,Chile,"Firm and rubbery, with neutral berry aromas. The palate is medium in depth and length, with cherry and red apple skin flavors.

128241,New Zealand,"Shows plenty of weight on the palate, but also an overall lack of intensity to its slightly vegetal—green pea—flavors. Still, there's enough passion fruit and grapefruit to provide a sense of balance and a crisp, clean finish.",Arona,85,11.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Barker's Marque
128242,New Zealand,"Offers herb, cranberry and cherry aromas upfront, followed by a medium-bodied palate that's cedary and herbal, but also shows some chunky cherry fruit. Finishes on oaky notes of coffee and chocolate.",,85,23.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Konrad
128243,US,"Tastes just like a cherry coke, with the heat of alcohol and smoky spice of oak. That's a pleasant, even complex mélange of flavors, even though the structure is simple and direct.",Reserve,85,16.0,California,Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Merlot,Wildhurst
128244,US,"Crisp and on the sweet side, this PG has flavors of honey, lemons, limes, green apples, figs and peppery spices. Nice as a cocktail sipper. Try with Chinese food for something different.",,85,14.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,Balletto
128245,US,"The straightforward Cabernet fruit is immersed in new oak, so the dominant flavors of smoke, toast, chocolate and espresso all seem to emanate from the barrel aging.

128246,US,"The vineyard is on Howell Mountain. It's an awkward wine, with lots to like, but some problems. On the plus side is enormous  cassis, cherry and chocolate fruit flavor and rich, fine tannins, and the 100% new oak seems proper given the wine's volume. But there's too much sugary sweetness in the finish, almost like a dessert wine.",Bancroft Ranch Vineyard,85,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Beringer
128247,Argentina,"Earthy and seemingly on the edge of being overripe, this is a wine that deals dark-fruit flavors, a milky, malty underlay, and a fairly sound mouthfeel. Ample tannins and resiny, peppery afternotes re-announce any previously detected oak, and like many wines from this vintage it's overly expressive.",Reserva,85,18.0,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Luigi Bosca

128249,Chile,"Bold and red on the nose, with only mild herbal aromas. That slight herbal character extends to the palate, where red plum and red currant flavors take over. With adequate size and plenty of fuel in the tank, this is no wallflower of a wine. But it is a bit limited and tangy, and the acidity seems amplified.",Hacienda Araucano,85,11.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Carmenère,J. & F. Lurton

128251,Spain,Opens with candied berry and salinic aromas. It's tough in its youth and also a little too funky to inspire much confidence for the future.

128258,Argentina,"Best Buy wines come in all shapes and sizes. This one settles at the bottom of the category, which doesn't mean that it doesn't have its charms, namely sweet and ready fruit and just enough acidity to keep it from being cloying. Keep in mind the price and young vintage when drinking.",,84,8.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Julia

128262,Italy,"Here's a simple, no-fuss Prosecco Extra Dry with an interesting herbal component that recalls dried oregano or hay.

128270,Australia,"This wine boasts aromas of intertwined cherries and herbs that make for a pretty first impression.

Drink now.",Giles,84,45.0,South Australia,Lenswood,,Pinot Noir,Henschke
128271,US,"The winery's '05 reserve is oakier than their regular Chard, and the wine is heavier and less fresh, an impression heightened by full malolactic fermentation, which has softened the acidity and given a buttery taste.",Reserve,84,28.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Chardonnay,Zina Hyde Cunningham
128272,Austria,"Dark purple, juicy wine, with spice and pepper flavors from the Zweigelt. The fruit comes through as fresh blackberries touched with plums and lightly tannic. Simple, rustic and fruity. Screwcap.",Koenigsegg Zwei. 1,84,12.0,Burgenland,,,Zweigelt,Schloss Halbturn
128273,US,"This hits the palate rather hard and green, with thin fruit that does not seem quite ripe. The barrel flavors add fat and caramel over the top, but remain unintegrated and seem out of place. The wine reverts to its green side as the tannins take over.",Skylite Vineyard,84,24.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Skylite
128274,Argentina,"A little sharp and unfocused on the nose, but the palate is simple and juicy, with tangy red-fruit flavors backed by good acidity and solid tannins.

The one negative is a sharp, minty green streak.",Vintner's Reserve,84,19.0,California,California,California Other,Merlot,Kendall-Jackson
128278,Argentina,"A touch creamy and milky on the nose, with shy tropical aromas in support. The palate shows warm-climate melon and peach flavors on a round, chunky frame.

128280,Argentina,"Powerful but reduced, with gritty berry aromas and a ton of clove on the nose. There's a carry over of the clove in the mouth, and also roasted fruit flavors, wood spice and sweetness. Powerful for sure, but arguably a bit too woody for its own good.",Tonada,85,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Finca La Anita

The finish is medium with hints of toast.",Le Sud,85,24.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Vin de Pays des Côtes Catalanes,,White Blend,Mas de Lavail
128289,Italy,"There are distant floral notes here, but in general this blend of Trebbiano and Vermentino from Grosseto, Tuscany seems initially closed. Perfumed aromas of jasmine and honeysuckle do burst through from time to time and the wine is crisp and snappy on the close.",Cuccallegro,85,,Tuscany,Montecucco,,White Blend,Piandibugnano
128290,US,"A clumsy wine. While there's some good blackberry fruit, the mouthfeel is sharp and edgy, suggesting green stems and pips resulting in hard tannins. Doesn't seem likely to age out.",Cañon Creek Vineyard,85,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Midsummer Cellars
128291,Argentina,"Pretty well composed on the nose, with a core of blackberry. The palate runs narrow and grabby, but the generic sweet berry fruit is tasty, albeit ultrasimple. Snappy on the finish, with the gritty feel of cherry and grape skins. Good in a basic way.",,85,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Mil Piedras
128292,US,"Rather simple, like a blackberry-infused cola punch. It's the kind of red wine to serve at a party, and everybody will like it, but there's not a whole lot going on right now. Could develop in the bottle.",,85,79.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Prestwood
128293,Chile,"So lean, green and austere that it's almost a ghost. The nose is kind of vegetal more than fruity, while the acidity is so staunch that it penetrates the tongue membrane and sizzles a bit. Flavors of lime and sour apple lead to an acidic, tart finish.

128295,France,"A very flowery interpretation with gardenia, freesia and carnations on the nose that carry over to the palate where they merge with fresh orange peel.

Should be drunk up in a year or two.",Prestige,85,14.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Cave de Ribeauvillé
128296,Argentina,"Smoky and rubbery on the nose, with some green oak aromas. The palate has a soft, pasty quality to it as well as flavors of black cherry and mildly roasted berries.

128301,US,"Fruit is both the hero and the villain of this Cabernet. The hero, because it offers huge, ripe, jammy flavors of blackberries and cherries that will make legions of red wine drinkers happy.

128302,US,"With 12 months in French oak, the Reserve Barrel Fermented Chardonnay is a rounder, more spice-infused Chard than Macari's regular Estate Bottled offering.

The main problem is an excessive sharpness that seems artificial. Drink now.",Reserve,85,25.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Petite Sirah,EOS
128330,Spain,"Pale and low on bead, but if you like a Moscato-style wine, this isn't bad at all. The palate is sweet, fleshy and smooth, with lychee and melon flavors.

128341,Chile,"A good $8 wine with snap, crackle and pop. The nose brings black cherry and saucy aromas, while the palate is sweet, a bit medicinal and just a little herbal.

128418,Germany,"If you're seeking laser-like focus in your eiswein, this is the bottling for you.

128419,US,"The “architects” name refers to the four vineyards that constitute the blend: Laetitia, La Encantada, Firepeak and Bien Nacido. The wine's purity is proof that a great Pinot does not have to come from a single vineyard. It's bone dry and full-bodied in tannins, with complex flavors of black cherries, red currants, Dr. Pepper cola and exotic Asian spices.

128423,US,"A lovely Cabernet notable for its trim, elegant structure. Made in a less ripe style, it shows crisp, firm acidity underpinning the blackberries, coffee, herbs and cedar.

128425,US,"A worthy followup to the wonderful 2006, K&B;'s '07 is silky and fruity in a way that is drinkable right now.

128426,US,"This vineyard-designate is always the winery's biggest Merlot. In this vintage of 2006, it shows impressively ripe flavors of blackberries and chocolate, with pleasant herbal nuances, wrapped into firm mountain tannins.

The approach is neither quiet nor loud, but well-spoken. It pumps forth huge black cherry and plum fruit, but offsets any raw size with tobacco, herb, coffee and other subtleties.

128510,Portugal,"Ripe and spicy, this is an impressive, solid, new wood-dominated wine. The tannins come from high toast as well as the concentrated blackberry juice fruits.

128512,Italy,"You pay, dearly, for quality, but rest assured you get it with Gaja.

128596,France,"Lemon and hay aromas on the nose get overtaken by a strong flavor of fall leaves in the mouth. Fairly dry and medium-bodied, this is a good choice with a wide variety of lighter fish and chicken dishes. But pick this one up soon for it's starting to show its age.",Les Princes Abbés,85,27.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Domaines Schlumberger
128597,France,"This wine makes you work harder than many of its neighbors to find the flavor but it's worth the effort when you uncover an intriguing mélange of hay, apricot and early summer fruits. The crisp, minerally finish puts one in mind of a platter of choucroute garnie. Drink now to 2013.",,85,15.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Dopff & Irion
128598,Chile,"Mild toast and banana aromas are simple, subtle and quiet. The palate has a citrusy zest to it along with simple flavors of kiwi, melon and green grapes. Finishes wet and easy; a good wine but nothing to go nuts over.",Natura,85,11.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Emiliana
128599,Chile,"Roasted, leafy aromas greet you, followed by familiar scents of cherry and plum. The body is light to medium, with citric acidity turning the raspberry and pie cherry palate in the direction of snappy. Lithe on the finish, with a quick fade-away.",,85,10.0,Central Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cono Sur
128600,US,"Here's a big, fruity, jammy Cabernet. It shows ripe, candied flavors of cherries, raspberries and chocolate, with polished tannins and a dry, spicy finish.",L de Lyeth,85,13.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lyeth
128601,Chile,"A bit foxy and jumpy at first, and then familiar aromas of berry and plum settle in. The palate is jammy and tannic, while flavors of berries and currants seem roasted. Tobacco and olive notes are present on the chewy, weighty, textured finish.",Reserva,85,12.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Porta
128602,Argentina,"Pungent and a little pickled on the nose, with oak and cream coming on a second wave. The palate is composed, normal in feel and shows slightly choppy cherry and berry flavors. Regular but short on the finish. Good wine; nothing more than that.",,85,13.0,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,Ombu
128603,Chile,"A dark, chunky wine with cola, cassis and beet-like aromas. The palate is extracted but gritty, with big blackberry fruit that doesn't change or improve in the mouth.

128606,Chile,"Very dark and grapey, with raisin, licorice and bite to the bouquet. Saturated and heavy in the mouth, with lemony acidity framing loud, generic black fruit flavors. The finish features ample oak in the form of butter and coconut. A little overripe and oaky, but on the right path.",Reserva de Familia,85,15.0,Rapel Valley,,,Malbec,Santa Carolina
128607,Chile,"The bouquet is arguably the best part: earthy berry fruit mixed with tobacco and leather. The palate, meanwhile, is fairly hard and clipped, with short cherry and berrry flavors in front of a fast-moving, tough finish. Not a bad wine but tough on the tongue.",Winemaker's Collection,85,15.0,Maule Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,Simone

128613,US,"The nose on this medium-bodied Merlot is lush with pleasantly charred oak, forest floor and ripe black plums.

128648,Italy,"Albera is a very well-valued Barbera d'Asti with chalky aromas of talc powder and schoolroom blackboard backed by cherries, blueberries and black fruit.

128650,US,"Too ripe and too oaky, and both attributes reinforce each other. The blackberry and currant fruit approaches Port in raisiny ripeness, while the oak accentuates the tannic sweetness.

128665,South Africa,"A touch overripe and indulgent, this Chard needs a little more vibrancy to enliven its heavy character. Mushy peaches, banana and mealy cantaloupe emanate from the bouquet while flavors of buttered popcorn and oaky spice dominate the palate. Try with a heavy cream-based dish to downplay the wine's own richness.",,86,25.0,Stellenbosch,,,Chardonnay,Thelema

128667,Chile,"Salad dressing, vinegar and a heavy herbal blast greet you on the nose. The palate is chunky and thick in feel, but the flavors mirror the nose with green notes, herbs and burnt coffee.

128671,US,"Tasted in October, 2007, the wine was mute, offering little aromatically except for teasing notes of blackberries and oak. That shyness extended to the taste, where strong, hard tannins provide an almost impenetrable coat of armor to what's inside. But right down the middle of the palate is a deep, intensely powerful stream of perfectly ripened cassis that's all the proof you need of ageability. This is a magnificently structured young wine, reminiscent of a fine young Pauillac.

128672,France,"Big and powerful, this is the grandest of the grand crus. It has both  a dense structure and overwhelming fruits. With minerality, spice and balance, this is a very complete wine.

128673,US,"This is among the lightest in color of Williams Selyem's ‘05 Pinots, and also the most delicate in texture. But yields were very low, and the wine has a fantastically concentrated taste of wild raspberries, as well as crisp, stimulating acidity. Despite the elegance, it's enormously complex, with tiers of oak-influenced cola, herb tea, pomegranate, vanilla and Asian spice flavors. Gorgeous now, this very great Pinot should develop well in the bottle over the next decade.",Precious Mountain Vineyard,97,85.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
128674,US,"Few wineries in California can craft a Chard as rich, balanced and ageworthy as this. In its youth this ‘05 is flashy in lemondrop, pear and spicy anise, with a honeyed finish and crisp acidity. It's quite addictively brilliant, a wine whose lush harmony mesmerizes the palate. But Hanzell Chards invariably age well, and this is a wine you can dependably put into your cellar for 5, 10, 15 years, even longer, as it continues to evolve and become more limpid and minerally.",,96,65.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hanzell
128675,US,"Dry and focused in acids, the wine shows the balance and complexity of the vineyard, as well as its ageworthiness. It's very young now, with immature raspberry, cola, rum punch, balsamic, mushroom and Asian spice flavors, but decanting and slow warming in the glass help elevate it. Nonetheless, your best bet is the cellar. Best after 2008, and for many years after, depending on how old you like your wines.",Allen Vineyard,96,78.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
128676,US,"A brilliant young Pinot that magically combines instant drinkability with ageworthiness. Silky and supple, the wine has broad, deep raspberry, cherry, cola, cocoa and spice flavors that are wrapped into sweet, fine tannins, leading to a long, complicated finish.

128677,US,"This is Sineann's first reserve, a limited release from some old vine blocks from one of Oregon's greatest Pinot vineyards, now fully biodynamic. As good as the “regular” Resonance is, this ramps it up another notch or two. The fruit ranges from cherry to prune; the acids are perfect, the barrel notes so well-concealed that you cannot separate them out. Streaks of cherry, fig, coffee, smoke, chocolate, bourbon, caramel—where do you stop? It just goes and goes.

128679,US,"This is one for the cellar. Dry and savory, it shows powerfully ripe blackberry, cherry, cassis and coffee flavors that have been well oaked, and the silky, elegant texture of Pinot Noir.

128682,US,"If you choose one wine to stick in the cellar from the '03 vintage, make it this one. It's so dry, balanced and complex, yet so tannicly tough now, that it demands a good 6 years, at a minimum. The heart of blackberries and red currants is opulently rich, with overtones of cedar, pencil lead, red licorice and sweet dried herbs. Brings to mind a classic Rutherford Cab. As delicious as the wine is now, especially with decanting, it really will benefit from aging.",Kronos,95,98.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Corison
128683,US,"This is Etude's inaugural bottling of this wine, a block designation from the estate. It shows not only classic Carneros quality, but something exotic. Dry and complex, the wine has cherry, cassis, raspberry and new oak flavors, with good acidity. That extra something is a feral, earthy quality, suggesting olive tapenade, sweet leather, tobacco and mushrooms that has got to come from terroir. Youthfully great now, and should age effortlessly for the next 8 to 10 years.",Temblor,95,60.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Etude
128684,US,"It's impossible for a Cabernet to be richer, more opulent or more hedonistically stunning on opening than this beauty from veteran Phelps. Admittedly, there are significant tannins. But the wine delivers a broadside of the sweetest, ripest cassis fruit imaginable, along with richly toasted oak. It's the kind of Cab that will dazzle even an amateur. Absolutely gorgeous now, with immaculate elegance. About the only criticism you can offer is that the structure is a bit obvious, and ageability may be limited.",Backus,95,200.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Joseph Phelps
128685,US,"Youthful tannins star in this young wine. The wine is dry and balanced, with a fabulous core of blackberry, cassis and smoky oak. With a drop of Petite Verdot, which adds a touch of violets, this is one of the best high mountain Cabs of the vintage. Too dry and toughly astringent to drink before 2010;  should develop well through 2016, at least.",Reserve,95,120.0,California,Sonoma-Napa,Napa-Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pride Mountain

128687,US,"Among California's First Growth Pinots, Hanzell's ‘04 is marked by a full-bodied, austere density that demands time in the cellar. It's a very dry, fairly tannic wine, rich in ripe crushed black cherry, red cherry candy, tobacco, cedar and spicebox aromas and flavors that are impeccably balanced. Really defines the terroir of the estate, and should develop well. Best 2010 through 2020.",,95,90.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hanzell
128688,US,"Even in its extreme youth, this lovely Pinot shows a supple elegance that's almost drinkable now. Almost, but not quite. The tannins are ripe and smooth but thick, and the young raspberry, cherry and tangerine fruit needs time to develop and mesh with the oak. But it's a beautiful wine, Williams Selyem's best Ferrington in memory, and a near-perfect expression of Anderson Valley Pinot Noir.

128691,France,"Using the old name for Bougros, this is from the steepest portion of the Bougros vineyard.

128694,US,"A beautiful young Rutherford Cabernet, showing the dusty elegance and complexity of a top estate. There's a rich herbality to the cherry, cassis and blackberry fruit, suggesting fresh green chervil, sage and thyme. Oak adds harmonious notes of vanilla, cedar and char. The tannins are thick and juvenile, but very finely ground. With 8% Cabernet Franc, this lush wine needs time.

In 2006 elegance is the keynote; with everything in perfect proportion and the fruit, acid, tannin and barrel notes in perfect harmony. The wine is young, almost austere, and the flavors are compact and wedged together, but they are there to be found if you sniff and look. The fruit is concentrated in the back of the palate and this wine perfectly captures an Oregon aesthetic without any of the rough edges or rawness. Will it age?

128762,Portugal,"Smoky, meaty aromas set the scene for an intensely rich wine. If the wood element is very apparent in the smoke and spice flavors, this is youth. Underneath, there is a concentrated dark series of black fruits, bacon and big, dry tannins. The wine needs to age for at least four years.",Reserve,92,45.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta de la Rosa
128763,France,The very reliable but little-known house of Ehrhart turns in a true stunner with this Riesling from the Schlossberg vineyard. Subtle but gorgeously complex notes of honey and orange peel serve as the opening act. The off-dry palate displays intense notes of ginger and candied fruit. This wine is both powerful and pure.,Grand Cru Schlosberg,92,35.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Domaine Ehrhart
128764,US,"The first Bishop Creek designation from Erath, this dark-toned, deep and concentrated Pinot Noir is one to cellar. The fruit is seamless, sappy and dense, suggesting a mix of ripe berries.

128766,Italy,"Harmony and remarkable integrity of the bouquet characterize this vibrant vineyard-designate Barbaresco. Ginger, allspice and licorice blend seamlessly with rosehip and red currant.

Drink now.",Florence Vineyard,92,32.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars
128771,US,"This is certainly one of the most distinctive Syrahs made anywhere in the New World. It has French elegance, including some garrigue-like scents— herbs and cured meats and pepper. Big blue and black fruits, lots of spice and a chocolaty finish tag this as a serious effort. Though the alcohol is written as 14.1%, it feels lighter. The brightness of the fruit and the freshness of the acids proclaim it as Northwest, but without the chewy tannins or excessive use of new oak that disguises the actual terroir. Fine effort.",Estate,92,30.0,Oregon,Southern Oregon,Southern Oregon,Syrah,Abacela
128772,US,"Evocative aromas carry spice, plum, cherry and earth; while in the mouth the flavors expand to include red licorice, raspberry pie and a streak of butterscotch.

128775,US,"This Zin shows classic Sonoma County character, but it's also a tannic, young wine that wants a little time in the bottle. Tasted at the age of two, it's astringent and jammy, with pepper-infused blackberry and mulberry flavors and a gamy touch of smoked beef.

128781,Italy,Ugo Lequio exhibits a deft hand when it comes to oak aging.

128784,US,"Monte Rosso red wines are always big, but this may be the most intense Cabernet ever to come from that mountain vineyard. It's in keeping with the Sbragia style of extreme ripeness and oak. Almost sweet, but really dry, it erupts in black currant, chocolate and smoky oak flavors, and needs time in the cellar to calm down.

128785,US,"Two words describe this wine: Could develop. That's what your palate signals when you experience the tough tannins and dryness of this young Cab.

128790,Argentina,"More floral and blueberry driven than Bousquet's regular Merlot from '07 but not discernibly better or worse. The palate is round and the balance and feel are good.

128802,Australia,"This is 85% Shiraz, with the balance being Petit Verdot, Viognier, Tinta Cão, Grenache, Tempranillo and Mourvèdre.

128805,Spain,"Warm, baked aromas smell of clay and raisin, and later a wave of minty green enters the picture.

128817,Spain,"Dark and powerfully oaked despite its 5-month pedigree. Mint, tar, shoe polish and blackberry work the bouquet, while the palate is structured and tight but also quite dark and woody.

128828,US,"A blend of Zin, Merlot, Cab Franc, Petite Sirah and Petite Verdot, this wine shows Paso Roble's ability to ripen red wines, even in a cool vintage.

128844,US,"Not clear what the varieties are in this blend, but it's a serviceable white   that suggests Chardonnay. Crisp and fruity, it has apple, peach and vanilla flavors that finish clean and spicy.",Collage,84,36.0,California,North Coast,North Coast,White Blend,Don Ernesto
128845,Argentina,"This mildly prickly, red-fruit dominated Malbec is perfectly drinkable. The nose is drying, while the palate shows red cherries and raspberry along with some forceful buttery oak. Reasonably long on the finish.",,84,8.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Conquista de Argentina
128846,Hungary,"An elegant nose of pepper and deeper berry/mocha aromas gives the nose of this wine a more mysterious character than the typical Cab Franc, adding to its appeal. On the palate, it's a medium-bodied, slightly spicy red with a touch of bitter tobacco on the finish. Friendly and flavorful.",Kúria Unfiltered,84,75.0,Villány,,,Cabernet Franc,Malatinszky
128847,Italy,"Moscato usually imparts musky, soapy and floral aromas and this expression from the Veneto is no exception. This is a no-fuss, casual wine with low alcohol and sweet, honey-like flavors.",Il Moscato,84,10.0,Northeastern Italy,Delle Venezie,,Moscato,Mionetto
128848,US,"A little rough around the edges, with a sweet, sugar-cured tobacco note to the tropical fruit, peach and pear flavors. But this is a good price for an everyday Chard with true varietal character.",,84,10.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Grayson

128850,Argentina,"Light green in color, with standard Torrontes aromas of acacia and tropical fruits. The palate is simple and delivers solid flavors of lychee, melon and green herbs; somewhat cloying and confected.",Reserva,83,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Tamarí
128851,US,"Hard in tannins, with a baked, pie-filling quality to the blackberry and black cherry fruit, this bone-dry Syrah is made for drinking now with robust foods, like burgers or lasagna.",England Crest,83,18.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Wellington
128852,Romania,"The spicy, floral nose on this white is enticing enough, but on the palate, the flavors are a touch watery and flat.

128853,Spain,"Old wines are not easy to appreciate, so we'd almost rather have you judge this wine. In our opinion, it's way too sour and lacking in fruit to justify rave reviews. Thirty years of age doesn't seem to have helped it, and what's left is sherried and pruny, yet with sharp acidity.",Castillo Ygay Gran Reserva Especial,83,225.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Murrieta
128854,US,"A problematic wine. It starts out with an inert aroma that's mainly caramelized wood.

128856,Australia,This light- to medium-bodied Pinot features modest cherry-berry fruit and a touch of cinnamon spice. But there's also a slightly acrid tinge to the aromas and this otherwise well-made wine lacks intensity and character.,,83,19.0,Victoria,Mornington Peninsula,,Pinot Noir,Cooralook
128857,Argentina,"Some wines in this range have it and others kind of struggle. This one seems to be fighting an uphill battle. The nose is unfocused and a little mulchy, while the flavors are jammy, sweet and basic. Tannin and acidity keep it cranking, but is that good?",White Pearl,83,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Antonio Cesar Cavalli
128858,Spain,"Rather minty and herbal up front, with grassy, field-like aromas overriding the red fruit that wants to peek through.

128859,Moldova,"There's a slightly eccentric nose to this Moldovan SB, with its baked vanilla and floral notes, and on the palate, the wine is a bit overwrought and grapy. But despite these hiccups, the wine offers overall refreshing citrus flavors and a nice spin of spice.",Reserve,83,16.0,Moldova,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Acorex
128860,Moldova,"A zippy, lively nose of citrus and lemon leads this simple but enjoyable wine from Moldova, and on the tongue, the clean flavors continue, offering accessible, fun character that will do well chilled and on a hot summer day, Refreshing and light, with a touch of sweetness, it's priced well for everyday consumption.",,83,8.0,Cahul,,,Pinot Grigio,Taking Root
128861,Romania,"The nose on this Merlot begins promisingly enough, with its cherry, deep spice and smoked edge, but on the palate, the wine is slightly rough and hot, and lacks the integration of a good Merlot.

128863,Argentina,"Big and black but also heavily charred and very oaky—we're talking bulldozer oak that leaves mostly resin and vanilla on the palate. Combine that with huge tannins and extract, and what should be pleasant and fruity becomes a stampede across the palate.",Oak Cask,83,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Trapiche
128864,US,"There's too much oak interfering with this Chardonnay, which was grown just below the Santa Lucia Highlands.

128866,Argentina,"The Torrontes character shows on the nose, meaning there's detectable lychee and orange blossom scents.

128867,Argentina,"Pungent, rudimentary berry aromas come across as candied, while the palate is very narrow and sweet. Drying on the finish due to wayward tannins; doesn't go beyond the ordinary. Imported by USA Wine Imports.",Reserva,83,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Finca Los Maza
128868,Spain,"Past its prime. The nose is heavy and the palate deals minimal peach flavors. It's wet but losing clarity, with bland apple and pear flavors left on the finish. This is not quite dead but best to wait for 2007.",,83,20.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Castro Baroña
128869,Croatia,"Made from Debit, the white grape variety found in Central Dalmatia and originating from Italy, this wine has aromas of vanilla and spice and on the palate, is round and smooth. The flavor is slightly rustic; pair with lobster or fish to take the edge off.",,83,13.0,North Dalmatia,,,Debit,Bibich
128870,Argentina,"Average red juice with sweet, rubbery aromas and flavors that match. It's Malbec in its most simple state: raspberry and cherry distilled into a quaffable liquid. Chilling might help.",,83,7.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trapiche
128871,Argentina,"Aromas of chewing gum, red fruits and asphalt lead to standard berry flavors, but the feel is scouring and the finish is rough. Seems like tartartic acid is the culprit here.",Amado Sur,83,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Trivento
128872,Bulgaria,"Light, delicate aromas of lemon and flowers lead on this Riesling, and on the tongue; it offers a nice intermingling of fruit, flowers and zest. It's a touch tart and angular, though, with overriding lemon on the palate, but at this price, it makes for a good everyday quaff.",,83,8.0,Bulgaria,,,Riesling,Targovishte
128873,Argentina,"A strong blast of oak comes across as resin and clove, and thus the wood doesn't augment but instead takes away from the fruit. Speaking of fruit, it's jumpy and tangy, with a finish that tastes of green olives. Overall it doesn't show proper balance or full development.",Maipu Vineyards,83,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Pascual Toso
128874,Argentina,"Very dark and charred, but at the same time it smells like a fudge milkshake mixed with espresso. It's plump but loose in structure, with generic black-fruit flavors and strange acidic kick.",,83,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Zolo
128875,US,"This is volatile and syrupy, with too much vinegary acidity and fruit that seems over-ripe and jammy. Interesting, but it probably should have been picked earlier.",Alice Vineyard,82,30.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Mourvèdre,Tagaris
128876,US,"This is a Merlot-based Bordeaux blend. The acidity is so high it almost burns. That's the wine's chief problem. Another is the tannic astringency.

128878,Argentina,"Sharp and tight on the nose, and then it stays narrow and rather punishing on the palate. It's a tangy, gritty, tough wine with tart red-fruit flavors and bitter coffee note on the finish. Malbec-Syrah-Tempranillo is the blend.",Aduentus Mediterráneo,82,,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Antigal
128879,Argentina,Waxy aromas of scented candles and canned pears define the nose. The palate is low on acid and thus tastes soft and remotely of Bartlett pear and peach.

128880,Argentina,"Lemony and stretched on the nose, with resiny oak aromas and a light hint of green. The palate has size, tannin and lots of oak, while the flavors run creamy and woody, with generic berry fruit residing under the surface. Decent for under $15, but an excess of oak creates a one-sided final product.",,85,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Viniterra

128887,Argentina,"Like most inexpensive Malbecs, there are some strained aromas here: tire rubber, stemmy fruit and cranberry.

128889,France,"While the aromas on this example are not perfectly clean, they are followed by a burst of flavor that makes up for it all.

128892,France,"Subtle in approach, in keeping with the Dopff & Irion house style, this wine shows good minerality on the nose and moderate intensity in the mouth.

128898,Chile,"A beast of a red wine, with minty, earthy aromas that sprinkle in tobacco and mint leaf.

128899,Chile,"Staunch berry and earth aromas are fine. The mouthfeel, however, is an issue due to fierce tannic bite and chunkiness.

128901,Chile,"Sharp aromas mix with softer ones, yielding a conflicted bouquet. The palate is plump as far as feel goes, with pithy flavors, honeyed citrus and lasting green bitterness.

128916,US,"The nose on this medium- bodied Merlot is pleasant with aromas of burnt coffee, soil and plush red plums.

128940,Italy,"Here's a southern Italian red with Barolo-like austerity: elegant notes of small berry fruit are seamlessly folded within layers of slate roof, ash, graphite, licorice and fine expressions rendered by volcanic soils and 18 months of oak aging. It really comes alive in the mouth, where the wine delivers power, concentration and a very long-lasting finish. This is Mastroberardino's flagship red.",Naturalis Historia,93,65.0,Southern Italy,Irpinia,,Aglianico,Mastroberardino
128941,France,"A very warm, generous, ripe wine, this comes from the most precocious of the grand cru vineyards. It is packed with yellow fruits, rich and open. This is opulence in a glass, boosted by toast and spice.",Vaudésir Grand Cru,93,86.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,William Fèvre
128942,France,"A concentrated, hugely rich wine with lively caramel and toast aromas, followed by ripe fruits. It is generous and open, with apricots and nectarines giving richness, while kiwi gives the green, crisp character. The aftertaste is all minerality. Screwcap.",Les Blanchots Grand Cru,93,60.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Domaine Laroche
128943,France,"A honeyed wine, soft and ripe. There is butter and toast, and acidity in the way of white fruits with only touches of citrus.

128944,Argentina,"Winemakers Hélène Garcin and Patrice Levêque have coaxed a ton of character from 70-year-old Malbec and Cabernet vines, and the result is juicy but dark, with asphalt and tar aromas sitting in front of tight but generous black fruit (cassis and blackberry). Finishing notes of coffee, mocha and char leave you happy.",Poesia,93,80.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Hélène Garcin
128945,US,"Corley builds its reserve Cab for the long haul. The wine is too tannic to enjoy now, numbing the palate with dry astringency. But there's great depth here, to judge by the wealth of black currant flavor that's accented by rich new oak. Cellar this puppy until at least 2008, and it should hit its prime from 2010 and for many years after.",Reserve,93,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Corley
128946,US,"Expensive, but worth it. Absolutely a first-rate dry red wine of great substance and authority. Shows full-bodied blackberry flavors with a meaty, leathery edge and hints of violets, tobacco, pepper and cocoa. Such is the tannic structure that the wine should develop through 2012.",White Hawk Vineyard,93,52.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,Luko
128947,Australia,"There's a noticeable background herbal element to this intensely concentrated wine. Dense layers of cassis and chocolate are front and center, filling the mouth with velvety richness and finishing long. Despite the power and richness, there's a structure to match, suggesting this will improve through at least 2012 and drink well until 2020.",John Riddoch Limited Release,93,45.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wynns Coonawarra Estate
128948,US,"The wine is certainly dense and layered, showing waves of blackberries and cherries, sweet leather and Asian spice, olive tapenade and beef carpaccio, and sweet, smoky new oak. It's extremely complex, and should develop in the cellar, although not for a long time. Best now through 2010.",Black Bear Block,93,55.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Zaca Mesa

128950,Australia,"Made in the winery's classically savory style, this flagship Cabernet shows a touch of bricking at the rim and some maturing aromas and flavors of tobacco, cedar and earth.

128953,US,"There have been Estate Selection Chards from Cuvaison before, but never a block bottling. This wine fully merits its status and price. Tightly angular and acidic in youth, it's very minerally, with a gunmetal tang to the oak-infused Meyer lemon, green apple and green pear flavors. One of the rare California Chardonnays not ready on release, this Chablis-style wine will be best in mid-2008, and should develop for another few years.",Estate Selection Block S,93,36.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Cuvaison
128954,Australia,"Operative words to describe this wine might include seamless and harmonious. There's such wonderful integration of fruit and oak that it's difficult to pick this wine's flavor components apart—it's a whirl of cassis and cedar, yet restrained; full-bodied, rich and dense without being heavy. Long and velvety on the finish, with enough soft tannins to last it 10–15 years.",,93,75.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Moss Wood
128955,Australia,"For the first time, Shadrach is a 100% Barossa wine, although most of the fruit is from higher elevation vineyards in the Eden Valley. Coffee, tobacco, cassis and chocolate aromas and flavors give this a decadent profile, but it retains Cabernet's aristocratic structure. It's round and rich, yet firmly built, picking up tea-like notes on the lengthy finish. Drink now–2018.",Shadrach,93,,South Australia,Barossa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Grant Burge
128956,France,"The 18 acres of Château de Grenouilles are a monopoly of the La Chablisienne cooperative. A huge, ripe wine, very fruity, with yellow peaches.

128958,France,"This is so closed up at the moment, all mineral and steel, that it is hard to feel the ripeness of the tropical fruit. As this develops, it will flesh out the yellow fruits, balancing the acidity. The aftertaste is already thirst quenching.",Bougros Grand Cru,93,60.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Jean-Marc Brocard
128959,France,"This tight, steely wine is austere initially, but opens up to show concentrated richness, with flavors of white currants, vivid green fruits and crisp, intense acidity.

128962,Australia,"For a late-release 2002, this is still very youthful, packing layers of rich cassis and blackberry fruit into a soft jacket of vanilla, cedar and toasted coconut.

128963,Australia,"From veteran winemaker John Glaetzer, this Cabernet from Langhorne Creek is something of a throwback, spending some 28 months in American oak hogsheads.

128965,US,"As usual with a Hirsch Pinot, the wine is young and thick and jammy, even a little heavy, and needs time to develop. The wild raspberry, sour cherry, cola and Asian spices have a touch of smoky new oak, while the tannins and acids are noticeable, providing a dry architecture for the ripe fruit. Should develop over the next decade, as everything comes together into balance.",Hirsch Vineyard,93,72.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
128966,France,"This wine shows that top Chablis should be aged. This is like tasting the barebones of the wine without the flesh that is still very hidden. There is suppressed power, as well as green acidity and potential richness. Wait 5 years.",Les Clos Grand Cru,93,59.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Jean-Marc Brocard
128967,France,"This shows how Dauvissat's wines need to age.

128974,US,"A good Zin, if a little rugged in tannins, with briary, wild blackberry, currant, chocolate and spice flavors that finish dry and tannic.

128977,Chile,"A little earthy and leafy on the nose and palate, but we like the wine's balance and saturation as well as its flavors of herbal cherry and berry. Finishes more roasted and warm, with kick carrying it toward conclusion. Grabby and leafy but good for $9.",Reserva,85,9.0,Maipo Valley,,,Shiraz,Santa Alicia
128978,Chile,"Forceful on the nose, with herbal, saucy, rubbery aromas. It's weighty in the mouth, with blackberry, herbal tomato and dry spice flavors.

128979,Italy,"The oak element is strong here—very strong—and one wonders if it will ever fully integrate even with more years of aging in the bottle. There's not much fruit left and what you do get is ripe and jammy. You can feel the alcohol at the back. Otherwise, the wine is dense and smooth on the palate.",Conca del Grillo,85,19.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Silvano Bolmida
128980,Chile,"Starts out kind of murky and pasty, with gummy black fruit and compost aromas. Airing helps it escape that shell, and in the mouth there's rubbery blueberry flavors mixed with mildly tart rhubarb and bramble. Good enough, but doesn't do much to push the envelope that is Chilean Syrah.",Winemaker's Collection,85,15.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Syrah,Simone
128981,US,"There's a whiff of volatile, hot fermentation aromas that overlie black cherry and smoky tar. In the mouth this is a chewy, earthy, smoky Cabernet, suitable for outdoor dining and grilled meats. The tannins are still showing a little green edge, but some extra breathing softens them up.",Berghan Vineyard,85,28.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pend d'Oreille

128983,Italy,Here's a bright and fresh Barbera d'Asti that would make a perfect companion to pizza or simple pasta dishes.

128984,US,"Given its late release, this has been in bottle for quite awhile, and is soft and already heading into midlife. The light cherry fruit is drying out, like fruit leather, and the relatively high (14.5%) alcohol starting to take over. Drink up.",Desert Wind Vineyard,85,12.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Merlot,Duck Pond
128985,Italy,"Friendly, easy-going and irresistibly cheerful, this light and luminous Asti delivers delicately fragrant tones of white flower, peach flower and honeysuckle.

128986,US,"Hendry has waited nearly four years to release this Zin, but it's not clear that age is on its side.

Best now while it still has some richness.",Block 28,85,30.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Zinfandel,Hendry
128987,Australia,"This is mainly Semillon and Sauvignon Blanc, with 25% Chardonnay and 9% Pinot Gris to round out the midpalate. Apple and citrus flavors dominate, and there is a certain plumpness to the wine but it retains its essentially citrusy character throughout.",Tilly's Vineyard,85,,South Australia,Barossa-Adelaide Hills,,White Blend,Henschke

128992,New Zealand,"Hunter's is an old New Zealand wine brand that should do better. That said, this is a solid Savvie, combining tropical fruit with fresh herbaceousness.

128993,Chile,"Quite raisiny, with an overweight personality conveyed through the nose. The palate is tannic, with black cherry and cola flavors thickened up by a full dose of raisin.

128997,Australia,"Renowned for its restraint and fine-ness, Mount Mary is an icon of Australian wine, and one that seems to perplex many American critics, including this one. Medium-bodied cherry fruit is tinged with vanilla and herb in this offering, which comes across as rather straightforward.",Quintet,85,125.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Mount Mary
128998,New Zealand,"A lean, somewhat narrowly constructed Sauvignon Blanc, the 2009 Sentinel is best suited alongside raw oysters, clams and the like, where its dry, herbal, stony character will match the shellfish's salinity.",,85,14.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Sentinel

129001,France,"A soft, relatively ripe style of Sauvignon Blanc, moving towards white fruits, even hints of lychee spice.

129002,Chile,"Slightly nutty and salinic on the nose, but mostly it's just neutral. Seems like an early maturing wine, meaning it's soft in its delivery of melon and apple flavors. Dry and a touch pithy on the finish.",Hacienda Araucano,85,12.0,Central Valley,,,Chardonnay,François Lurton
129003,US,"Bright and sharp, this assertive Viognier has strong scents of citrus rind, suggestions of stone, and cool-climate fruit flavors.

129011,Chile,"Oily and sort of muddled at first, but soon it gathers its legs and focus. The body is fairly full and round, while the flavors of citrus and melon are solid but pithy. With grapefruit and orange on the finish, it slides toward citrusy while delivering more than adequate punch and kick.",Reserva,85,12.0,Limarí Valley,,,Viognier,Viña Tabalí
129012,Australia,"This effort shows regional Coonawarra character in its minty-leafy-tobacco-like aromas and flavors alongside cassis fruit, but lacks the flesh and rich textures of the region's top examples.

129015,South Africa,"This Shiraz/Viognier starts with the fragrant aromas of Viognier—apricot, honey—mingled with the smoky spice of Shiraz. On the palate, smooth, integrated flavors of rich fruit, herbs and pepper are serious, but the wine has an easygoing edge. Good minerality keeps it clean. A versatile food wine.",,85,35.0,Stellenbosch,,,Shiraz-Viognier,Radford Dale

129017,US,"The aroma suggests a ton of oak, and that impression carries over to the flavors.

129021,Chile,"A touch stemmy on the nose along with hints of compost, leather and animal. But in the mouth, it rings true as Pinot Noir.

129027,US,"It's styled a bit like a Syrah from southern Oregon, which is to say, sharp and peppery. For Syrah it does not quite show the fruit density needed to adequately play off the heavy tannins, and the finish is a bit hot.",,85,24.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Syrah,McKinley Springs
129028,New Zealand,"This shows a slightly smoky or fumé character on the nose, then melon and citrus notes. It's on the lean, zippy side of things, without any overt tropical fruit or herbaceousness yet ending on a lime-like note.",,85,16.0,Waipara,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Mount Grey Estate
129029,New Zealand,"A blend of batches made in neutral oak and stainless steel, there's no obvious toast or vanilla to this fruit-driven Chardonnay.

129030,Germany,"Full bodied and lush, with layers of honeyed fruit: peach, melon and pineapple. The minerality of the site is submerged under a wave of ripe fruit, so either enjoy it now for its fruit-forwardness, or hold 10 years to see how the slate looks when the fruit levels subside.",Wehlener Sonnenuhr Auslese Gold Capsule,92,42.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Dr. Loosen
129031,US,"Always a strength at David Hill, this may be the best Riesling they've ever made.

Lovely acids boost the palate presence and keep it refreshing.",Estate,92,16.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Riesling,David Hill
129032,France,"There is good density here, a wine that seems well balanced and integrated. It has a solid, firm kernel, but this is balanced with great fresh acidity as well as blackberry fruits. The wine still seems to be coming together after bottling, and certainly needs 4–5 years.",,92,180.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Angélus
129033,Portugal,"A big wine in every sense, from its bold black fruits and dark chocolate flavors to its layer upon layer of tannin, acidity, wood and then more fruit. Obviously for aging, this needs at least 2–3 years.",Conceito,92,46.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Conceito Vinhos
129034,Portugal,"Parcels of old vines produce this complex wine. It has dark black berry fruits while still retaining freshness over the bone-dry tannins.

129035,US,"Strong in fruit and oak, but very rich and elegant. Shows massively ripe flavors of green apples, pears and pineapples, with a honeysuckle floral note and leesy, oaky influences.

129036,Spain,"Opaque and nearly over the top, with concentrated, roasted aromas of baked blackberry and dark plums.

129039,France,"Soft wine, the Merlot in the blend giving a round character to the texture. It is juicy, fruity, a gentle, mellow wine that seduces by its delicious ripe berry fruits.

129045,US,"A Bordeaux blend from Newton's mountain estate, this lovely wine starts out with a fat, fleshy appeal.

129047,US,"A very good but not great Cask 23, showing plenty of decadence and flair but not perhaps that extra edge of complexity. It's forward now in sweet new oak and flashy, jammy blackberries, cherries and raspberries. The tannins are quite an achievement, rich, vibrant and supple. Made from 100% Cabernet, it's full-bodied and dense, with a chocolaty finish.

129049,France,"Made only from Roussanne, one might expect a dramatically different style of Hermitage. But not so much.

129051,Portugal,"Without doubt a wine that needs aging. The tannins from both wood and fruit are dense, concentrated, layering over the delicious fruit.

129052,US,"An absolutely delicious wine. It's like a fine Pinot Noir in the silky texture, yet deeper and bolder, almost Grenache-like, in the blackberries, cherries and currants, with tangy notes of oranges and vanilla.

129053,US,"In 2007 the winery's Estate bottling seems to capture a bit more nuance and detail than the reserve, though admittedly it does not have quite the same concentration. For those who prize finesse, this is the wine of the vintage. Herbal and resiny, it's like sniffing a fine wine in a pine forest.

129057,US,"The latest in a superb lineup from Adelsheim in 2007, this single vineyard offering carries a faint scent of animal leather, giving it a musky/truffle streak. It's velvety in the mouth, lightly spicy, complex and layered, with tart red fruit flavors that run from pomegranate to raspberry to wild cherry. Cocoa powder and pencil lead add further interest to the finish. The alcohol is listed at just 12.8%.",Calkins Lane Vineyard,91,58.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Adelsheim

129062,Italy,"Luigi Baudana presents a hedonistic Barolo that is beefed up with thick concentration and a far-reaching palette of aromas, ranging from chocolate fudge to ripe raspberry.

Getting back to Sentius, a so-called “second” wine, it is dark, sexy, smooth and shows true Priorat accents of schist, coffee, cola and berry aromas. The flavors are flashy and fresh, with mammoth black cherry, plum and coffee virtually jumping from the glass.

Spice and tobacco aromas complete a finely judged wine.",Reserva,92,34.0,Dão,,,Portuguese Red,Casa de Santar
129076,US,"This is essentially DDO's reserve Pinot Noir; it requires some patience at first, because it is quite tight, almost inscrutable. With many hours of breathing it fleshes out and opens up, revealing a wine with interesting nuances of cured meat, mushroom and light earth. The fruit is a notch more concentrated and full than the regular DDO, but retains a sense of tart berry and light cherry rather than being sweet or jammy. This absolutely must be decanted well in advance.",Laurène,92,65.0,Oregon,Oregon,Oregon Other,Pinot Noir,Domaine Drouhin Oregon
129077,Portugal,"This complex blend of Syrah, Touriga Franca, Alicante Bouschet and Trincadeira is very successful.

Drink 2020 to 2030.",Liste,92,85.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Damilano
129085,Spain,"Melis is a project backed by wine industry folks from California, but this blend of old-vines Grenache along with Carignan, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is very European. It's heady but well balanced, with smooth edges and not too much fiery attitude, roughness or scratchy tannins. It's forward and big-boned, but there's enough creamy richness to make it friendly.

129107,Argentina,"A strange set of aromas makes for an unusual bouquet: violets, black cherry, flower-scented air freshener and blueberry are all part of the picture. The palate is superficial and not real deep, with candied, unconventional flavors of herbal berry and candy. Finishes jammy and off the grid.",,85,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Faustina
129108,Spain,"No one says Verdejo is an ager, but this '08 is fading. The nose is soft and peachy, with weight and vanilla.

129110,Argentina,"Typical of a Patagonian red, the profile of this Merlot is fresh, racy and snappy, Red fruit and black pepper aromas get it going, while the cherry and raspberry flavors are crisp and forward. Solid but generic red wine.",,85,16.0,Other,Neuquén,,Merlot,Areo
129111,Argentina,"Light and slightly soapy smelling, with lychee notes. The palate is full and round, with warm flavors of tangerine and lychee.

129112,Italy,"Pretty aromas of expensive leather, calfskin and roses follow through to a subtle palate of tar and violets. Cherry and wild berry flavors perfume the medium finish.

129117,Argentina,"Colorful but low in pulse, with jammy, pasty aromas sitting in front of a bulky, one-dimensional palate that offers standard blackberry fruit and mildly herbal side flavors.

129183,Chile,"Candied but also peppery and herbal, and without much depth or complexity. The palate is tight, acidic, sheering and tastes of snappy, edgy cherry and raspberry fruit.

129184,US,"Barrel fermented and aged in American oak for 15 months, this is a big and powerfully oaky Chard with dominating notes of butter, wood-infused stone fruit and apple pie along with a hint of grapefruit oil in the mouth.

129185,Chile,"As the production on this wine climbs (it's up to 35,000 cases now), the final product becomes more generic. An opening of bold berry fruit comes with a pounding mix of oaky vanilla and milk chocolate, while the palate has acidity for zest but also a lot of creamy oak.

129189,Chile,"Generally speaking, Errazuriz's progressive wines hit their marks. But this Chard seems to be substituting oak for substance.

129193,US,"A little dainty on aromas with hints of nectarine, honeysuckle and licorice. The mouth is ripe and rich with notes of roasted red apple, orangey citrus and a touch of mealy stone fruit.

Fragrant and complex, this offers pleasures for both nose and palate, with scents of leaf and spice and herb, leading into a surprisingly dense and textural blend of wild berry, rhubarb, melon and mixed tropical fruits.

129266,US,"This single-vineyard Zin is a considerable improvement over the ‘04. The alcohol in the ‘05 is far lower, almost a full percent, yielding a more balanced and harmonious wine.

129292,US,"A solid every Zin, dry and spicy, with flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and loads of anise and black pepper. Good price for a nice, easy wine.",,85,12.0,California,California,California Other,Zinfandel,Cline
129293,France,"Soft, rather bland wine, which seems to play down the crispness of good Chenin in favor of a wood-dominated style. Baked apple and cream flavors are present, with some juicy green plum acidity somewhere in the background.",,85,12.0,Loire Valley,Anjou,,Chenin Blanc,Château de la Guimonière
129294,Chile,"A little soft and syrupy on the nose, with vanilla and blackberry aromas. The palate is full but clumsy, with jammy berry flavors and not a whole lot of precision or focus. Fleshy late, and always a bit wayward. Good enough if not put to the test, but among so many Chilean Cabernets it doesn't distinguish itself.",Special Reserve,85,12.0,Maule Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Simone
129295,US,"Pretty good for the price. Dry and fruity, with polished cherry and cassis flavors. Turns a little harsh and minty, but easy to like with pizza, burgers, enchiladas.",Crimson,85,12.0,California,California,California Other,Red Blend,Stephen Vincent
129296,Chile,"This bruiser is purple in color, while the nose is deep but sort of medicinal. Time in the glass helps it along, but still it's bulky, bullish and untamed, with slightly syrupy plum and boysenberry flavors. Colorful and bold, but not that refined or structured.",Reserva,85,15.0,Limarí Valley,,,Carmenère,Viña Tabalí
129297,Chile,"The nose features eucalyptus, mint and plum aromas, while the palate is chunky and a bit flat, with soft tannins, jammy dark-fruit flavors and accents of vanilla and syrup. Gets softer as it airs out, and in the end it fades away quietly. 450 cases made.",Reserva,85,16.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère,Nuevomundo
129298,South Africa,"A very pretty nose and palate of white fruit, citrus, melon and flowers gives this white a stylish twist. A touch of toast gives the otherwise crisp, fruity wine extra dimension. Great for pairing with seafood—think meatier, richer bites like tuna or lobster.",,85,21.0,Stellenbosch,,,Chardonnay,Mulderbosch
129299,Chile,"Fairly straightforward and solid Merlot from Chile. The nose is sort of brambly, but there's reasonably fresh plum and berry aromas. The palate is acid-charged and thus not sloppy or muddled, with bright cherry and red-plum flavors. Hints of pepper and herbs accent a zesty finish.",Gran Reserva,85,16.0,Central Valley,,,Merlot,San Fernando

129301,South Africa,"Rustic and earthy with smoke, bramble, rubber, wild berries and balsamic reduction in the forefront. The mouth offers more berry and ripe plum notes, leading to a sweeter mocha dominant finish. Drink now.",Dark Lady of the Labyrinth,85,20.0,Wellington,,,Pinotage,Doolhof
129302,US,"Despite good vineyard sources, including DuBrul, Weinbau and Ciel du Cheval, this does not rise to the top ranks of Washington Cabernet Franc. The addition of 10% Sangiovese seems only to thin it out. It's astringent and herbal, with light cherry fruit.",,85,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Franc,Club Deluxe
129303,US,"Fierce in acidity, as Sangiovese tends to be, and with cherry pie flavors, elaborated with sweet, smoky oak. Somewhat one-dimensional, but pretty and bone dry, with a spicy finish. Ready now, and doesn't require decanting.",,85,22.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Sangiovese,Eberle
129304,Chile,"Aromas of cherry and raspberry bring a slight earthy stemminess, while the palate is light and zesty, with semisharp plum and pie cherry fruit flavors and a dash of red sucking candy.

129305,New Zealand,"This bargain-priced offering combines tobacco leaf with Green Gage plum in a medium-bodied format. The flavors aren't quite as fresh and vibrant as the best examples, but it'll more than do for many occasions.",,85,10.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Lobster Reef
129306,US,"A relatively soft entry, tart plum fruit, simple berry flavors and a hint of burnt toast. There is a slight burn also in the finish, that reflects the near-15% alcohol. A little chocolaty film wraps the tannins.",,85,26.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Barbera,Locati Cellars
129307,US,"A good Cabernet, although it's a bit tough in the mouth, with chewy tannins and a rusticity that comes from unevenly ripened fruit. Still, it's dry and clean, with enough blackberry and oak flavors to satisfy.",,85,28.0,California,Napa County,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Girard

129312,Australia,"Produced in association with Katnook Estate, this is an easy-drinking Cabernet with substantial oak influence.

129313,US,"Although this Cab is nearly seven years old, it's still hard and tough in tannins, and the tart acidity suggests it will remain unbalanced for the rest of its life.

129317,Israel,"The mouthfeel of this wine is beautiful, with a velvety texture and dusty tannins, and the lingering, coffee-infused finish seals the experience nicely.

129318,Chile,"Lime aromas and modest minerality are proper given its origin, but it turns softer and sweeter the more time it airs out.

129322,New Zealand,"A bit too pungent and sweaty to score higher, with pronounced and aggressive nettley aromas and flavors. It's round in the mouth, finishing herbal and green. Some will no doubt praise it for these same qualities.",Reserve,85,17.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Brancott
129323,Italy,"Here's a luminous and crystalline white wine in a screwcap bottle with linear and direct aromas of white mineral, kiwi and pear.

129326,Chile,"Plump, sweet and tropical on the nose, but also not that focused or powerful. The palate is flat in feel and a bit sticky, with vague, candied flavors of papaya and melon.

129328,US,"A good and flavorful Cab, with intricate layers of blackberries, currants, anise and cedar, and entirely dry. The drawback is sharpness in the form of green, acidic tannins. Won't age, so drink up.",,85,23.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,B Side
129329,Italy,"Here is a sweet and fragrant dessert wine with aromas of white flower, honey and stone fruit accented by a slightly drying mineral characteristic.

129333,US,"Dark, dense in structure and fairly tannic, this Syrah floods the mouth with powerfully ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, cola, leather, spices and sandalwood.

129338,US,"One of the ripest of Hartford's new Pinots, this is a full-bodied and very rich wine. It offers extreme flavor in place of subtlety, offering a massive palate wash of blackberries and cherries that veers into Lifesaver candy. The bet is ageability.

129339,France,"Very few Crozes manage to be mini-Hermitages, but this one succeeds admirably.

129343,US,"A Syrah of considerable proportions. It shows the volume and drama that most Santa Lucia red wines display, with a tremendous depth of fruit.

129347,Italy,"Here's a modern and bold blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Nebbiolo with rich, ripe fruit flavors, dense texture and impressive complexity.

129348,France,"This is a solid, finely perfumed wine, the tannins giving concentration and structure. There is some severity as well, a sign that it is still settling into the bottle.

129368,Spain,"Quite well-oaked, which is the house style for Lanzaga. There's darkness, vanilla, char, leather and a bed of black fruit. The palate has a tight but nice feel to it, with fine tannic structure propping up plum, blackberry and chocolate flavors.

129470,Argentina,"Trapiche's Broquel line has never featured Pinot Noir before, and maybe this is why. Talk about a sharp, scouring wine.

129471,France,"From Bouchard's home vineyard, this is one of their signature wines. In 2005, it has produced a luscious, fruity wine whose richness is only a part of its wonderful floating character.

129473,US,"The vineyard has been the source to some of Goldeneye's deepest, most profound wines, and the '05 certainly is big and cellar-worthy.

129474,US,"Strong's Symmetry almost qualifies as a Cabernet Sauvignon, with 71% of that variety, and the rest consisting of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. The Meritage labeling identifies it as their supreme bottling of a Bordeaux-style wine. Easily the best Symmetry ever, it is a great wine. Dry and somewhat astringent in tannins, it has an impressively deep core of blackberries and currants, with an array of sweet herbs, chocolate and tobacco.

129475,Italy,"An intriguing, fabulous dessert wine. The aromas are complex, intense and balanced on a tightrope: mature peach, honey, wet stone, peppermint and delicate mineral nuances. Picolit is an indigenous grape that suffers from a unique disorder in which a good number of berries on each cluster never mature. The remaining berries become concentrated in rich flavor and sugar. Livio Felluga's version is a masterpiece that ends with a fresh, menthol-driven finish and a crisp close.

129476,US,"Hat Trick is the best of the best of Morgan's estate vineyard, which is in the chilliest northwestern part of the Highlands. Acidity stars, giving the wine a brilliant crispness that's so clean and fine. Barrel fermented in one-third new French oak, the wine is incredibly rich and leesy. The terroir has coaxed out complex layers of pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes, apricots and very exotic tropical fruits suggesting golden mangoes and papayas.

129477,Portugal,"The legendary Mouchão, one of Portugal's most revered wines, has finally made it to this country. Made in traditional open stone fermenters, this is not a modern wine.

129478,US,"It's amazing how rich this is, given the pale, translucent ruby color. Waves of cherries, raspberries, roasted hazelnuts, cola, pomegranates, herb tea, dusty Asian spices and smoky oak change constantly in the glass, as the wine breathes and endlessly fascinates.

129479,US,"Dryness and acidity mark this terrific wine. It's one for connoisseurs, a Pinot that requires some understanding to fully appreciate, as it's not a hedonistic seducer.

The 2003 features plenty of body, a creamy, velvety texture and bright cherry fruit. Darker notes of cassis lend depth, embellished by hints of eucalyptus, tobacco and vanilla. Drink now–2015. Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.",St. Hugo,91,33.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jacob's Creek

129557,US,"This is one of the most expensive California Viogniers on the market, but it's also one of the most stylish. Structure is the hallmark. It's easy to catch Viognier's exotic tropical fruit, wildflower and spice flavors, and this one does. But what's hard is to achieve is this degree of dry balance and elegance. There's a savory minerality that underlies the peach, apricot, peach, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors.",,91,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Viognier,Joseph Phelps
129558,US,"The tannins are so rich, and the acidity so fine, that this Zin gets extra points. It's fantastically ripe in flavors, with a spectrum of red and black cherries, cassis, black raspberries, anisette, tangerines, cocoa and dusty spices. Delicious.",The Sophisticate,91,24.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Four Vines
129559,Australia,"Full-bodied and rich, Cape Mentelle's 2002 Cab Sauvignon is a slightly minty wine, but relies more on ripe cassis and chocolate flavors for power and weight. The silkiness of the tannins suggests only 2–3 more years are needed before this wine really hits its stride.",,91,45.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cape Mentelle
129560,Italy,"Chocolate, cherry, blackberry and clove linger long on the nose and open the door to more layered nuances of ripe red fruit to come.

129561,Australia,"This well structured wine with powerful tannins starts off with scents of meat, leather and coffee that gradually give way to aromas of vanilla and cedar. The oak is balanced by dark fruit flavors of cassis and chocolate, adding licorice and charcoal on the finish.

129564,US,"When first opened it is tight and herbal, with the scent of blood. But the subtle hints of rock and spice that underlie the pristine cranberry fruit need some years to unwrap themselves. This new 2006 Schindler comes out swinging, its wild berry fruit laced with earthy, barnyard funk. Tastes like an unbridled mix of fruit and soil, spice and barrel, that adds up to a vibrant, earthy, alive Pinot.",Schindler Vineyard,91,42.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Sineann
129565,US,"Ponzi's reserve shows plenty of well-defined muscle and sinew, with firm and slightly chewy flavors of red berry, cranberry and spicy red apple. The tannins are relatively smooth and ripe, and the flavors have a pleasing resonance as they weave through the finish. There have been some vintages where the new oak seemed a bit heavy-handed; not so here. This wine has the structure and balance to reward some years in the cellar.",Reserve,91,60.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Ponzi
129566,US,"This seductive single-vineyard offering from Erath strikes a perfect flavor chord, with tangy, juicy raspberry underscored with gun metal and graphite. Sleek and polished, it is a sculpted, elegant wine that demonstrates that moderate alcohol (13%) does not necessarily mean wimpy flavor. Oh, and the color is a gorgeous, transparent ruby; the look and the scent alone get you salivating.",Leland,91,40.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Erath

129570,Italy,"There's a flat or slightly oxidized quality to this wine: It opens with a deep golden color and offers aromas of mature peach, apricot, ash, almond paste and lemon zest.

129572,France,"From an average red vintage in the Loire, this shows a tight, almost stalky character, its spice and fruitcake flavors cut with dry tannins and just an edge of green pepper. Not for aging, drink this year.",,84,,Loire Valley,Anjou,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,Domaine de Montgilet
129573,France,"Obviously not in the first flush of youth, this dry rosé goes more for mature almond marzipan along with cranberry juice flavors to give some tightness to the texture. Definitely to be drunk now. Screwcap.",,84,14.0,Loire Valley,Rosé de Loire,,Cabernet Franc,Domaine des Baumard

129576,US,"Grassy and sharp, with the acidic, gooseberry and pea vine character that New Zealand versions sometimes offer.

129578,US,"Light chocolate, baking spice, clove—this wine tastes almost exclusively of barrel. There are hints of light strawberry and lunch meat in the aromas. The vines are young and seemingly the fruit has no power or varietal character; the heavy oak and hot finish do not help.",,84,20.0,Washington,Rattlesnake Hills,Columbia Valley,Tempranillo,Kennedy Shah
129579,US,"There's a good wine in here, but it's buried under so much oak, it's hard to taste it. The flavors of caramel and butterscotch swamp the underlying pineapples. Oakophiles will love it.",Island Block,84,20.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Murphy-Goode

129583,Chile,"Citrus-driven and still fairly smooth and full, with pear, white grapefruit and pineapple flavors. There's size and body to the wine, but also citrusy acidity to keep it moving forward.

129588,Chile,"A sweeter, richer, more confected wine, with aromas of buttered toast, butterscotch and apricots. The body is full but not what you'd call flabby; there's adequate acidity to cut the chunkiness. Flavors of apple, melon and mango are sweet, and there's some toast and then a mealy quality to the finish. Heavy and sugary but not a bad wine if you get at it now, before it fades to corny flatness.",El Conde Gran Reserva,84,14.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Chardonnay,Conde de Velázquez
129589,Australia,"Rubbery and tar-like at first, and those aromas just wouldn't loosen their grip. On the palate, there's some pleasant plum-like fruit and hints of espresso and asphalt.

129600,South Africa,"The sweet edge to this sparkler makes it quite attractive and a pleasant alternative to the more common dry styles typically served today. The nose offers notes of toast, apple skins and pineapple core while the mouth shows riper flavors of peaches and cream and a hint of honey. Overall, a fun and well-balanced semi-sweet sparkler.",Bliss Demi-Sec,85,16.0,Western Cape,,,Champagne Blend,Graham Beck

129604,Chile,"A bit narrow and medicinal, but overall this Cab delivers reasonably good cherry and herbal berry aromas and flavors along with some oak, coconut, citric acid and earth.

129621,US,"Tasted just at its official release, this very young Syrah was not in full form. The barrel scents and flavors were not integrated, and the fruit was standard red wine fare.

129624,Chile,"Melon, apple and pear aromas are far from complex or elevated, but the wine does smell reasonably good.

129625,New Zealand,"A bit disappointing from veteran winemaker Alan McCorkindale, or maybe this is just sliding past its prime. The modest grapefruit notes, herbal overtones and tart finish are fine, but fail to excite. Drink up.",,85,19.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Thatched Hut

A competent wine that's above average for the price.",,85,6.0,Curicó Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Quasar
129630,Spain,"A winner and a fine value from Bierzo. Luna Beberide is a model producer, and this single-vineyard wine has a pretty nose of berry, mineral, bacon and herbs.

129636,US,"Very rich and classically structured, a wine that shows real Merlot personality.

Should develop through 2012.",Michael Black Vineyard,91,55.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Coho
129637,Italy,This powerful expression of Cabernet Sauvignon opens with thick layers of spice and toasted oak that surround a juicy core of cherry and wild berry.

129639,US,"This is an enormously fruity Zinfandel that offers a flood of flavor, making it instantly likeable.

129643,France,"Think of this wine as a tough, ornery relative who shows great depth once you get to know him. Leather, chocolate and prune notes mark the aromas and flavors, and the wine shows some alcoholic warmth and drying tannins.

129646,Spain,"For a big-production wine (33,000 cases) with just 12 months of barrel aging, this is impressive. Sweet but balanced dark fruit and cola aromas are nice, while the palate is forward and tastes of blackberry and cola.

129647,US,"Though relatively young (planted in 2001) this Dundee Hills vineyard can deliver the goods.

129730,US,"What happened? This wine went from a dense and powerful 2004 version to this thin, woody and green effort. It is hard to believe that something major has not changed—vineyard sources or rows? In any event, despite its dark color, the wine has no weight; it's just a thin, generic red.",,83,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Woodinville Wine Cellars
129731,Argentina,"Better at first, when it gives green aromas and a lightness of being. But the palate runs kind of heavy, and the more you taste the heavier it gets.

129734,Chile,"A tart and sharp-edged Cabernet from Maipo? That's pretty much what this punchy, citrusy wine amounts to.

Much more zesty and tangy than you'd expect.",Gran Reserva de Los Andes,83,12.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Alicia
129735,Chile,"Deep and dense, but also mossy and funky. This wine takes an inordinate amount of time to find its groove.

129781,Argentina,"From the onset this wine struts its stuff. The nose amounts to a magnetic blend of cola, spice and exotic dark fruit, while the palate is intense with driving black cherry and blackberry flavors.

129783,Italy,"Santadi's Terre Brune is a wine that sets the bar for the region it represents: in this case, the island of Sardinia. The hot 2003 vintage delivers loads of red fruit and cherry that borders on cherry comfiture.

There's plenty of fruit to back up the lavish oak treatment, but this wine needs 3–5 years to integrate its cassis fruit with the overlay of vanilla, chocolate and toasted coconut.

129789,US,"This is the best California Tempranillo in this critic's experience. Granted, the competition hasn't been all that great, but this wine stands for itself. It's full-bodied, dry and crisply tannic, and the cherry-berry, bitter chocolate, and fig flavors have just the right touch of new smoky oak.

129791,US,"Vibrant acidity marks this wine, making the wild cherry, raspberry, cola and tangerine zest flavors racy and fresh.

129795,US,"This deceptive Pinot, from one of Oregon's newly-coined AVAs, enters with light cranberry and strawberry flavors, but keeps piling on nuances. First it adds in some baking spice, hints of cardamom and caroway, then seems to gain in weight and strength as it sails across the palate.

129802,US,"Even at four-plus years, this interesting Syrah needs a little more time to show its best because, while it's very good now, it's tight in tannins that shut the palate down.

129806,US,"The Arcus estate vineyard includes plantings from 1973 and is easily the best wine made at Archery Summit. The fruit flavors weave together black cherry, fig and currant, beautifully integrated with the bacon fat notes from the new French oak.

129813,France,"Superripe pear aromas are followed by fruit that hints at oxidation, very open and soft with an intriguing saltiness. Only towards the end does the wine show structure, with pineapple and peach flavors. The fruit is intense, but in the end, the wine seems to fall apart.",La Varenne du Poirier,84,23.0,Loire Valley,Anjou,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine des Grandes Vignes
129814,Chile,"Opens with fiery cherry-berry aromas and then some mossy dankness. The palate is tight and snappy, with basic berry flavors and then a blast of burnt toast and herbal notes.

129818,Chile,"Full and fiery smelling, with black cherry, cola and oaky aromas of butter and cream. The flavors are a touch herbal and creamy, while the fruit leans toward berry and fat plum. With airing it settles into a simple, reasonably good Merlot.",Private Reserve,84,17.0,Maule Valley,,,Merlot,Terravid

129820,Chile,"A little gritty and meaty on the nose, with vegetal notes of celery and beans sneaking onto the bouquet. The flavors are fairly generic for New World red wine, so expect plum and berry flavors with some herbal accents and a touch of core bitterness. Reflective of the variety on one hand but generic on the other.",Reserva,84,13.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Carmenère,Ventisquero
129821,Chile,"A bit sweet, confected and fluffy on the nose, especially for Syrah. And it's definitely on the heavy side as the flavors lean toward raisin and prune and stewed plum. Finishing notes of chocolate and toast come straight from the barrel, and with such a heavy outlook it's doubtful this one will age for long.",Colchagua-Apalta Single Vineyard,84,18.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Syrah,Veranda
129822,Chile,"Not what you'd call overtly fruity with its charred, reduced set of grilled meat and leathery aromas.

129826,Chile,"Big but clumsy, with unrefined aromas of berry fruit and herbs. The palate is grabbby and sassy, but it's also generous with the sappy black plum, berry and herbal flavors.

129831,US,"This Syrah, as in 2006, is the best of the Airfield reds, opening with varietal scents and showing some gamy, herbal, minty notes.

129832,New Zealand,"Almost pale coppery in color, Isabel's 2007 Pinot Gris is made in an off-dry style that's presumably meant to buffer the wine's crisp acids and cool, minerally personality.

129833,Chile,"Plenty of oak off the bat, which is what deviates this wine from the brand's standard $8 Cab. Frankly, we prefer the cheaper one; this is lemony and overcrowded with coffee and mocha characteristics.

129902,Greece,"This wine showcases the native Greek variety Robola beautifully, with its crisp, clean citrus aromas and flavors and minerally/sea salt spin. The wine has a fresh quality but offers layers of lemon and orange. The finish is like a spray of the sea on the palate. Pair with seafood and light salads.",,90,18.0,Cephalonia,,,Robola,Gentilini
129903,France,"Guigal is now making 40-45% of the entire Condrieu appellation, making the quality of this cuvée quite an achievement. Floral notes lead off, followed by hints of peach, apricot and honey, and the wine walks the requisite balance between round lushness and peppery, minerally spice. Drink now-2012.",,90,55.0,Rhône Valley,Condrieu,,Viognier,E. Guigal
129904,France,"Aged in a combination of one- and two-year-old oak and stainless steel, Guigal's 2007 Saint-Joseph is round in the mouth yet minerally at the same time, with graphite notes supporting the voluminous pear and melon fruit, right through the lengthy finish.",,90,30.0,Rhône Valley,Saint-Joseph,,Rhône-style White Blend,E. Guigal
129905,France,"There is a high level of wood here, but that is sustained by the weight of the black fruits and the rich tannins. The wood gives a vanilla character that will disappear in a year or two, leaving a solid wine that is dominated by ripe, sweet Merlot.",,90,,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Lascombes
129906,France,"The wine has developed well, with plenty of weight, but the fruit seems a little diffuse, soft, open in character. It's masking the tannin core, a wine that opens slowly and carefully.",,90,55.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pavie Macquin

129908,France,"This all-Roussanne cuvée is a broad, fat wine that somehow pulls itself together to deliver a long, mineral- and spice-tinged finish. Some nice pineapple fruit holds it together through the midpalate. Has a reputation for aging well, so this score may seem conservative in five years' time.",Vieilles Vignes,90,182.0,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,,Rhône-style White Blend,Château de Beaucastel
129909,US,"For those who want some buttered popcorn flavors in their Chardonnay, this nails it.

129910,US,"Stainless-steel fermented, technically off-dry but still quite citrusy and bracing, this continues a string of excellent Rieslings from Anam Cara.

129913,US,"Thick and substantial, this is a full-bodied, almost meaty Chardonnay with a mix of citrus and stone fruits. It was barrel-fermented, and is graced with flavors of toasted cracker.

129914,Spain,"Deep and masculine, with full-force fruit from start to finish.

129916,US,"The Ana vineyard dates back to 1976, though this wine includes fruit from newer Dijon clone plantings. Aromatic and herbal, it's annotated with briar, sassafras and rosemary.

129917,US,"A very good Opus with plenty of forward cherries and black raspberries as well as rich notes of spiced oak that give a nougat or crunchy vanilla granola sweetness to the finish.

129921,US,"The most successful of Amphora's new Pinots because of its richness and balance.

129922,France,"This has really come on since the futures tastings in 2008. Today, the wine shows pedigree, the dusty tannins ripe, fitting well with the spice, acidity and soft, generous fruit. Concentration comes through from the solid final fruit flavors.",,90,,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Labégorce Margaux

129932,Hungary,"The wine has a rustic overall character that is hard to embrace. On the nose, the lively, spicy character is appealing, but on the palate, it wants more balance.

129936,US,"The official residual sugar reading is .77%, but you don't need a degree in fruit chemistry to know that this is a sweet wine, more appropriate as a dessert sipper than as a dry table wine.

129995,US,"Good, dry Merlot, with balanced tannins and oak and ripe blackberry fruit. Those tannins take some getting used to, with an astringent lockdown quality, but this is not an ager. Decant, and drink with steaks and chops.",,87,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Rutherford Hill

129997,US,"Despite its youth this is already showing a light orange tone and the fruit is round, ripe and quickly maturing. It's drinking well, with forward flavors of berry, plum and leaf. Tannins are tight and hard, ripe but unyielding.",Yamhill Springs Vineyard,87,37.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Raptor Ridge
129998,France,"Despite being rather full-bodied, this isn't soft at all, instead offering up scents of lime and lemon and firm, assertive flavors of apple and citrus. Finishes crisp and long. This could work as a mouthwatering apéritif or perhaps with raw shellfish.",Cuvée Anne-Laure,87,12.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Arthur Metz
129999,Italy,"Here's a rosato from Tuscany that is vibrant and clean and richly redolent of forest fruit, red berry, dried sage and minerals. In fact, the herbal quality is unique and impressive. It's clean and fresh in the mouth with medium persistency.",Centine,87,12.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Rosé,Banfi
130000,US,"With its firm, dry tannins and crisp acids, this is not one of those soft, fruit-driven Merlots, but an earthy one. It shows tobacco, sage and wintergreen flavors, with a suggestion of red cherries and sweet oak. It's a nice delineation of a drier, more structured style of Merlot.",Fambrini Vineyard,87,45.0,California,Ben Lomond Mountain,Central Coast,Merlot,Beauregard

130004,France,"Made in the traditional Hugel style, this is a dry, high-acid Riesling. Scents of lime and chalk dust combine with green apple and petrol aromas to make for a classic bouquet. Modernists may find the palate a bit lean, but others will find it sharply focused, with a racy, zesty finish.",,87,18.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Hugel
130005,US,"This is a result of the increasing presence of rather rare Rhône valley grapes here in Washington. The blend is 42% Counoise, 41% Mourvèdre and 17% Grenache.

130006,US,"This bottling of Chardonnay, from one of the best white wine sites in Monterey, has kept its quality as well as its price over the years.

130007,US,"Made from Musque clone, and completely barrel fermented with sur lie aging in partial new oak, this is a good wine that can't quite overcome its feline character.

130008,South Africa,"With its elegant pale pink color, light but layered nose of strawberries, grapefruit and guava and its reasonable price, this rose from consistently solid Stellenbosch producer Mulderbosch is an accessible and affordable food wine that will please multiple palates.

Drink now.",Rosé,87,12.0,Stellenbosch,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mulderbosch
130009,US,"The winemaker added a little Syrah “to round it out,” and there does seem to be a depth and richness of chocolate and violets to this cherry-flavored wine.

130010,New Zealand,"Starts off a bit slow, with scents of underripe peach or melon that are a bit unyielding, and a hint of matchstick-like, Fumé character.

130011,Spain,"Clean, dry and ripe she goes, and that's just the way we like it. The nose on this Garnacha-Carignan blend is precise and easygoing, and the raspberry flavors are pure.

130012,France,"A light, dry style of Pinot Blanc, with apple, melon and mineral hints backed by citrus and wet stones that finish crisp and dry. As prices for Riesling and Pinot Gris have edged upward, Pinot Blanc has remained the bargain variety of Alsace, and this is a solid example, best served as an apéritif or with light fish dishes.",,87,11.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Blanc,W.

130020,Italy,"Usually a consistent value wine from southern Italy, this Negroamaro-Cabernet blend offers a fully charged nose with Indian spice, iron, cherry and leather.

130024,Germany,"Smells of waxed citrus rinds, and although there's a hint of green apple to the flavors, that same citrusy note dominates. It's a light- to medium-bodied, relatively dry Riesling that could just use a touch more weight and power.",Halbtrocken,85,18.0,Rheinhessen,,,Riesling,Sander

130027,US,"Most Oregon Syrah is grown in the south and trucked up to Willamette Valley wineries, but Cristom grows its own. Admirable effort, but it falls a bit short on flavor.

130031,Spain,"Dark cherry, raspberry, mineral and black pepper aromas start this value-driven Priorat on its way.

130035,US,"Many Oregon wineries made elegant, appealing wines in 2004, but the estate's unusual location does better in warmer years.

It's partly the acidity, which is high, and partly the gunmetal minerality, courtesy of another cool vintage in the southern Napa/Carneros region where the grapes were grown. Add in oak-infused pineapples, peaches and pears, and you have a fairly significant wine that could even benefit from some years in the cellar.",,90,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Stags' Leap Winery

130085,Australia,"Taylors (exported under the Wakefield Estate label) is a top-notch source for Cabernet Sauvignon. The 2004 boasts a big nose of cassis, mint or eucalyptus and a touch of roasted peppers. It's mouthfilling, with plenty of soft tannins, then finishes with more cassis and a hint of coffee.",,90,17.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wakefield Estate
130086,Italy,"Visually, this is a stunning wine: It's extracted and dense with purple-ruby streaks and leaves thick trails of glycerin on the glass. The nose is not as intense as you'd expect but it does dole out good portions of sweet, luscious fruit, mulberries, plums, blackberries and a touch of cookie dough. It ages 12 months in barrique.",Rocca Rubia Riserva,90,24.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Carignano del Sulcis,,Carignano,Cantina Santadi
130087,US,"This Merlot comes down on the elegant side. It's not an opulent, hedonistic wine, but one of great structure and architecture. The cherry, berry, orange and herb tea flavors have an edge of dried herbs and tobacco. Distinguished, it should hold for a couple years.",,90,34.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Frog's Leap
130088,Italy,"Mature notes of ripe peach and apricot immediately give this dessert wine's sunny, southern roots away. From sun-drenched Campania Felix, this is a viscous, syrupy treat with concentrated notes of fruit and nuts: almond, roasted chestnut and even a touch of peanut skin. This vintage is syrupy sweet in the mouth, but not as crisp.",Privilegio,90,56.0,Southern Italy,Irpinia,,White Blend,Feudi di San Gregorio
130089,Australia,"A perplexing wine to evaluate, Cullen's 2004 flagship red is a medium-weight blend of 84% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot and 3% Cabernet Franc. It's fruit-forward, with bright cherry and cassis notes, but is there enough stuffing behind that to balance the moderately astringent tannins? Give it 3–5 years and see if it blossoms.",Diana Madeline,90,75.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Cabernet Blend,Cullen
130090,Australia,"Full-bodied and youthfully tannic, but quite promising, this wine features a big core of cassis fruit and plenty of oak-derived embellishment. It's not herbal, but not pruny either, hitting the sweet spot between under- and overripe. Good now, but should hold through at least 2013.",,90,22.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kangarilla Road
130091,US,"Dry and fashionable, this has a dusty, minerally character and high acidity that's reminiscent of a good Chablis.

130093,Australia,"An intense, well-made Cabernet, with typical mint and cassis aromas and bold flavors of black currants and vanilla.

130094,Australia,"The 2004 vintage was a good one for Barossa Cabernet, and this wine delivers a panopoly of red berry aromas and flavors, all backed by darker notes of cassis and chocolate.

Lovely effort!",Covey Ridge Vineyard,90,42.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Sineann
130096,Italy,"Sardinian Carignano is one of the Mediterranean's underappreciated treasures and this expression of the variety is redolent of sweet spice, plump cherry and soft vanilla.

130097,US,"More acidic and tannic than most Cabs these days, this wine is rich in blackberry, cherry, currant, cocoa and new oak flavors. It's a high-class Cab, but one that needs time in the cellar for the astringency to resolve.

130098,Argentina,"Since Aurelio Montes of Chile crossed the Andes three or four years ago to make Kaiken, the Ultra line—be it Malbec or Cabernet—has been a consistent performer. This vintage pours on the rich, extracted aromas of black fruit and cassis, and then follows that up with similar flavors. It's full-bodied but not necessarily a heavy wine, with sweetness and chocolate but not much nuance or complexity. Drink now–2009.",Ultra,90,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kaiken

130100,Italy,"This layered and elegant wine shows the aging potential of Fiano, one of Campania's most important indigenous grapes. The nose is redolent of stone fruit, yellow melon, white mineral, flower and there's a nice element of toast or nuttiness that adds fullness and smoothness. It is aged 12 months in barrique.",Colle dei Cerri,90,26.0,Southern Italy,Fiano di Avellino,,Fiano,Di Meo

130102,Italy,"Because this wine is made from a 50-50 blend of Cab Sauvignon and Cannonau, you could call it a “Super-Sardinian.” Everything about the nose and mouthfeel are pretty much super anyways; from its abundant aromas of red fruit, dried herbs, licorice, mint and toast to its firm tannins and excellent length. The wine ages three years in oak.",Tanca Farrà,90,22.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Alghero,,Red Blend,Sella & Mosca
130103,Australia,"Give this wine a quick decanting prior to serving if you can, so that its lively cassis and floral components come to the fore.

130104,US,"Ripeness was not a problem with this wine, which is fat and unctuous. It shows complex apricot, mineral, pear, green apple and lees flavors that finish with a glyceriney taste of honey.

130105,US,"The fruit comes from the Seven Hills vineyard, on the Oregon side of the Walla Walla AVA. The fruit flavors are an intriguing mix of black cherry, plum and bourbon-soaked fig; there's nothing shy here. What is especially noteworthy is that winemaker Ken Wright has crafted a Syrah that is distinctively different from others that are using this fruit; it's more stylized, the fruit more precise, the barrel flavors more advanced.",,90,40.0,Oregon,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Oregon Other,Syrah,Tyrus Evan
130106,US,"Big, powerful and high in alcohol. The grapes evidently got superripe, giving the wine massive blackberry and chocolate-covered raisin flavors that have been liberally enhanced with smoky new oak. Tannins are pretty tight, coming from Pride's 2,100-foot elevation spanning the Napa-Sonoma border. A little awkward now.

130108,Argentina,"Chakana strikes again with this excellent value-priced Malbec. The nose hits firmly with smoke and rubber before settling on ripe black fruit notes.

Great depth and purity for a wine not meant to be complicated.",,90,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Chakana
130109,US,"The goal here, says the winery, is to craft a wine that embodies the essence of Pinot Noir. Whatever that means, this is their priciest Pinot and the one that they have designated Reserve. It's got bulk and power, and I like the way it gathers strength in the mid-palate and on through the finish. It has pretty cherry fruit and good concentration; it does not have the textural detail of the single vineyard Corral Creek.",Reserve,90,60.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Chehalem

130111,Italy,"Here's a fresh and easy blend of Trebbiano, Chardonnay and Sauvignon (at an attractive low price) that offers clean, but not very intense, aromas of cut grass, field flowers and lemon.

130112,Chile,"Fairly gritty and reduced at first, with aromas of grilled beef, leather and herbs.

130117,Chile,"Falernia hails from the northerly Elqui Valley, and its wines are unconventional and frankly all over the map as far as baseline quality goes.

130125,Chile,"Simple and sort of plastic in smell, taste and feel. Bubble gum and apple skin flavors infiltrate the palate, and the mouthfeel and finish are creamy, dry and seem to be flattening out.

130132,Chile,"Not many modern-day Carmenères are as overtly green and underdone as this, which is surprising given that it's from warm Colchagua and a good vintage.

130174,US,"Though Washington is rarely recognized for its Gewürztraminers, the grape does exceptionally well here, and Celilo in particular has become a treasured hunting ground for winemakers specializing in the grape. This one is a gem: spicy and off-dry, it expands across the palate with authority and precision. Rather than sweetly floral, it leans toward flavors that are sweetly grassy, but lets pretty rose petal highlights fill in the back of the palate.",,89,14.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Gewürztraminer,Maryhill

130176,US,"This is a lush wine. It's 95% Cabernet, with a few drops of Cab Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Distinctly Californian in the softness of tannins and low acidity, it's ready to drink now. The waves of cassis and notes of licorice, cola and new oak impress with their richness. However, this is the leanest Rubicon in years, missing the qualities of greatness.

130181,France,"A very floral wine, poised and creamy. Already there is an almond character as the wine develops, but it still hasn't lost sight of the initial fresh green fruits. Drink now; it will only develop slightly.",Grand Blanc Brut,89,75.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Philipponnat
130182,France,"It's good that Pommery has given this wine some bottle age, despite the young image the label suggests. The result is dry, but with less fruit and more secondary toast and nut flavors, a finely textured wine. It also has some weight, which balances the acidity well.",Pop Extra Dry,89,50.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Pommery
130183,France,"This is the palest of pinks. To taste, also, it is more a white than a rosé. There's just that touch of structure to add complexity to the deliciously fresh green-apple fruit flavors.",Rosé Brut,89,70.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Pommery

130193,Argentina,"The nose is like a convention of all the food groups: there's bold fruit, grilled meat, cola and even some yeasty toast.

130203,US,"Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller percentages of the other four Bordeaux varieties, this strongly tasting wine is fruity-sweet in blackberries, cherries, raspberries, cocoa and new smoky oak.

This Reserve is certainly the best wine in the range, a sophisticated wine that has seen new wood aging; this has highlighted the sweet red fruits, given point to the acidity and spice, as well as adding complexity to the black plum flavors.",Reserve,90,25.0,Burgenland,,,Zweigelt,Zantho
130345,US,"Napa Cab doesn't get any richer than this. It really sets the New World standard, with almost dessert levels of blackberries, cassis, plums, cherries, chocolate, elaborate new oak, the works. Also in the modern style are the tannins, as ripe, soft and sweet as butter. But it's probably not an ager, and will be problematic at food pairing. From Mia Klein, it's more of a tasting wine.",,90,70.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Selene
130346,France,"For a red Sancerre, this is rich, with ripe cherries and black plum skin flavors, reinforced by well-judged wood. The acidity is also well in balance, a layer that lifts the denseness of the fruit and dry tannins.",La Moussière,90,65.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Pinot Noir,Alphonse Mellot
130347,US,"Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Merlot and Syrah, this is a dry, fairly tannic wine that's a bit astringent now, and may develop in the bottle, to judge by the deep core of blackberry, cassis and cherry-chocolate. It's very elegant.",Blend 24,90,36.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Blend,B Cellars
130348,US,"Sweet enough to be served as a dessert or with cheeses but not with dessert, this is a luscious, fruity wine that simply delicious. A hint of aprict adds dimension to the superripe apple and pineapple flavors.",Late Harvest,90,25.0,California,Arroyo Seco,Central Coast,White Riesling,J. Lohr
130349,Italy,"Following a generational change, Manara is another small producer who sparks buzz and renewal in Valpolicella.

130352,Argentina,"Dark purple in color, but more leafy and murky than you'd expect on the nose.

130355,Chile,"Reasonably solid and inviting on the nose, with clean fruit and a touch of oak. The palate is spritzy and jumpy, with sweet apple, pear and melon flavors.

130359,US,"This Albariño is a pretty little wine and refreshingly different. There's subtle white flowers and quince upfront, followed by a light-bodied but intensely perfumed palate.

130363,Argentina,"Deep and jammy on the nose, and nothing if not potent. But elegance, clarity and sophistication are nowhere to be found as the wine's grapey, soupy, flat character takes over.

130369,Chile,"Sweet, candied rosé with a cute name and a clear bottle? Aren't we beyond that by now? Apparently not, so this berry cooler of a wine gets an acceptable rating along with notes that it's chunky, likable and awfully sweet.",,83,10.0,Rapel Valley,,,Rosé,Lucky7
130370,US,"A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon and 50% Syrah, the Chiripada Winemakers' Select offers up sweet red fruit with a raspberry edge.

130371,Argentina,"Two vintages of this wine are on the books, and frankly something isn't clicking.

130372,US,"A bit of an odd duck, with both confected notes and a green, herbal character, this Cabernet Franc manages to charm nonetheless.

130373,Chile,"Heat, cherry and peppery, herbal aromas get it going, followed by murky, herbal flavors and a hard feel. The finish is quite herbal, and there's more than an accent of tomato. Also a touch bitter. Run-of-the-mill Merlot at best.",,83,10.0,Central Valley,,,Merlot,Terrapura

130380,US,"INOX—from the French inoxidable—is Chehalem's stainless steel fermented and aged take on Chardonnay. It is consistently their best effort, with bright, acid-driven fruit that is a complex blend of pineapple, green apple, golden apple and Asian pear.

130383,Italy,This Fiano-based wine offers the generous pear and peach aromas often associated with this native grape from Campania plus its trademark structure and caressing consistency (it is oak aged for six months).

130384,US,"Babcock's Grand Cuvée hasn't changed its style over the years.

130388,Australia,"No Shadrach was bottled in 2002 or 2003, so this is the last vintage until the terrific 2004.

130390,France,"This goes for the tropical fruit side of Chardonnay, a big mouthful of round, rich fruit, yellow pears, apricots, lifted by a touch of kiwi. There is a final crispness to keep the whole fruit salad in order.",Vaucoupin Premier Cru,90,,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Jean-Marc Brocard
130391,US,"This wine wears its 15.8% alcohol better than any similarly heady wine out there. Yes, it's a bit hot, but the heat comes across as a slight chili pepper edge to the blackberry and dark unsweetened chocolate flavors, and the wine is, in its own way, balanced and elegant.

130392,US,"Kunde has a remarkable consistency with their estate Viognier, and the ‘06 shows off the variety at its best.

Try as an alternative to a rich Sauvignon Blanc.",,90,24.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Kunde
130393,US,"You'd have to call this a pretty wine, elegant even, with lifted cherry fruit over juicy, citrusy acids. It hits a bit of a wall around the mid-palate, but it moves through and on into a substantial finish that's balanced and clean. Herbal notes are subtle and refined, and as with all the Le Cadeau wines, this will benefit from additional years in bottle.",Diversité,90,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Le Cadeau
130394,US,"This is really a nice Cabernet Sauvignon. Soft and polished, it shows herb and cassis flavors, wrapped in rich smoky oak, with a long, dry finish. The tannins are quite strong now, giving the wine a chewy toughness and suggesting moderate aging. Hold until after 2008.",E. Passalacqua Heritage Estate,90,32.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gia Domella
130395,Australia,"There's plenty of vanillin and cedary oak in this wine, but it's easily balanced by impressive levels of cassis and blackberry fruit. The texture in the mouth is creamy and supple, and the finish is long and vanilla-laden but silky, without any harsh wood tannins. The blend is 89% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Malbec, with bits of Petit Verdot and Merlot.",Frank Potts Red Wine,90,27.0,South Australia,Langhorne Creek,,Cabernet Blend,Bleasdale
130396,Spain,"A unique take on Manzanilla Sherry, which is often light and sea-flecked but in this case is more amber, hazy and full. The nose is racy and spicy, while the palate offers dried apricots, orange peel and salt. Finishes with tang offsetting hazelnut and walnut notes. Oily, interesting and very good if you are a Sherry fan.",Manzanilla,90,10.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
130397,Italy,"Here is a modern and friendly wine that is high in approachability and low in fussiness.

The mouthfeel is succulent and sweet with chewy tannins.",Assajé,90,39.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Isola dei Nuraghi,,Carignano,Capichera
130398,Spain,"Spicy and a little woody on the bouquet, with ripe black-fruit aromas, a speck of mineral and a touch of cough drop. This is Torres' first commercial Priorat wine, and it's not a tannic specimen, yet the raspberry and dark-fruit flavors are sound and tasty. Finishes smooth, with a beam of acidity keeping it in balance. Drink now or at any time over the next few years.",Salmos,90,32.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Torres
130399,Australia,"This is a big, fat, almost sweet-tasting Cabernet Sauvignon, with ripe fruit framed by lavish French oak redolent of cedar, vanilla and toasted coconut.

A good choice for steak, and it won't break the bank.",,90,22.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tapestry
130400,US,"Smooth, crisply acidic and bone dry, this Chard shows an austere minerality and streamlined texture that makes it very food-friendly.

130402,Australia,"Big and richly oaked, this Barossa Cab nevertheless pulls off its 15% alcohol with aplomb, offering layers of blackberries, vanilla and dill.

130403,US,"Gloriously perfumed, this mixes scents and flavors of citrus rind, expensive soaps and sweet spice.

130404,US,"Dry, complex and elegant, this is a multivineyard blend that shows a fine expression of Santa Rita terroir.

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Roessler
130405,Spain,"Dark and definitely not reserved, this is a big blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot that pours on the rich blackberry, cola, chocolate and smoke character. A lot of powerful new oak backs it all up, leaving espresso bitterness and mocha sweetness on the finish. A modern wine with ample lushness.",Emeritus,90,90.0,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,,Red Blend,Marques de Griñon
130406,Australia,"From the team at Yalumba, this is an excellent value, delivering dark, concentrated aromas and flavors of cassis and chocolate, leavened with just a touch of mint.

130407,Australia,"The wine suggests the vintage's cool ripening temperatures in its hints of roasted pepper, but also features plenty of cassis and tobacco for balance. It's full-bodied and rather tannic; another few years of cellaring are in order.",St. Andrews,90,50.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wakefield Estate
130408,Australia,"A dark, earthy take on Cabernet, without the obvious cassis character that often overtakes Australian Cabs. Instead, the aromas and flavors lean toward black olive and tobacco. Tannins are fully ripe and soft, making it easy to drink now, although there's enough tart acidity for balance.",Sami Two Vineyards,89,35.0,South Australia,Barossa-Langhorne Creek,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dutschke
130409,Spain,"Overall this Callet-led blend might exceed its more oaked, richer brother known as Son Negre. Àn has a rooty, oak-driven nose with hints of herbs and tobacco, while the palate is dark and tasty, with blackberry, cherry and cured meat flavors.

130410,Chile,"Like the Chilean Merlot of olden days, this one is fairly mulchy and astringent. And it's also a bit old tasting, with some core berry fruit but mostly earthy flavors and forced spice. Some red fruit on the finish helps it, but still there isn't much essence to this wine.",Viejo Feo,83,11.0,Maule Valley,,,Merlot,Viña Tinajas
130411,Chile,"A hot and chunky wine with slightly chemical/medicinal aromas leading to gummy raspberry and strawberry flavors.

130415,Chile,"A decent attempt at a serious blended white wine, but age and other things aren't working in its favor.

Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC.",Special Reserve,83,23.0,Limarí Valley,,,White Blend,Tamaya
130416,Chile,"A bit aggressive and hot at first, and then mossy and earthy. The palate delivers weight and forceful acidity, while the berry flavors are robust but grating and weighed down by a lot of warm, woody overtones.

130422,Chile,"Just like the prior vintage, this wine may be organic but it's not all that good. The color is opaque purple and the nose is jammy like Jungle Juice.

130608,US,"Nice and drily acidic, with a minerally, citrusy mouthfeel. That's good, but there's a touch of dirtiness, a moldy taste that lowers the score a lot.",Union Island White,82,15.0,California,California,California Other,White Blend,Bixler Vineyards
130609,Austria,"Very candy shop in its aromas and flavors, a wine that is flagrantly perfumed and touched by wood. The wine is so spicy and perfumed that it is hard to discern the fruit.",Contessa,82,35.0,Burgenland,,,Chardonnay,Giefing
130610,Italy,"There's a touch of red apple skin or apple sauce at the start that is followed by slightly awkward notes of bubblegum and cotton candy. This is a strange Negroamaro-based rosé with aromas of chopped mint or herbs at the back. The mouthfeel is bright, tonic and firm.",Negroamaro,82,,Southern Italy,Salice Salentino,,Rosé,Villa Mottura
130611,US,"A hard wine to like. It's acidic and raisiny, and despite the official alcohol reading of 14.7%, tastes far higher, with a hot, chile pepper burn.",Clockspring,82,16.0,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Amador Foothill Winery
130612,France,"This Riesling will suit fans of neutral Italian whites. The nose is shy and retiring while the palate is light on its feet, with notes of lemon and wet stones. Bracing acidity, making it a good partner with light fish dishes.",Reserve,82,22.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Jean-Baptiste Adam
130613,Chile,"There isn't a whole lot of good going on here. The nose is cheesy and smells of animal hide and leaves, while the palate is far too acidic, which puts a tight, dry, sour spin on the wine's cherry and raspberry fruit. Sharp and angular on the finish as well.",Reserva,82,13.0,Maule Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hugo Casanova

130620,US,"This wonderfully rich young wine is enormously powerful in blackberry preserves, crème brûlée, mocha and cassis flavors. There's lots of new oak, but it's well integrated, and the tannins are softly gentle, yet ripe and complex.

130622,US,"The Schramsberg sparkling wine owners jumped into the Cabernet game a few years ago, and it was an impressive debut. The '03 shows they're in it to stay.

130624,US,"Steve Leveque, the winemaker at Chalk Hill, is doing everything right. Everything he touches is gold, including Cabernet.

Inky black in color, it leads with a blast of toasty, mentholated oak on the nose, backed by waves of blueberries and mint. Then the flavors call to mind dark chocolate and coconut, accented by almonds and the recurring blueberries. It's creamy-textured and finishes long, with supple tannins that deftly dry your palate; they're almost unnoticeable yet still provide structure. Drink now–2012, maybe longer.",Ben Schild Reserve,94,48.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Schild Estate
130628,US,"Tasted blind, I thought this was Russian River. It has the classic balance, complexity and flavors of that region, showing cherries, cola, rhubarb pie, pomegranates and spice, with a full-bodied dryness and long, ageworthy finish.

130631,US,"I had to double-check the price on this brilliant wine because it's much less than other Napa Cabs. It's a fat, sweet, fleshy wine, instantly appealing for its delicious blackberry, blackstrap molasses, cherry, violet and sweet oak flavors, yet it's a cellar guarantee. The tannins are finely ground and wonderfully ripe, giving the wine a firm lushness that lasts through a long, satisfying finish.

130634,US,"This is a tremendous young wine, enormous in fruity stuffing. It's fairly tannic, but the Grenache-like cherry, cassis, plum and fudgy chocolate flavors are so powerful, so evocative, nothing could mask them. Grilled steak will tame it, but this is a good cellar candidate to open between 2008 and 2015. You can also decant for a few hours.",Coach Insignia,94,70.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Fisher
130635,US,"The vineyard is in Calistoga. The wine, 100% varietal, has lots of new French oak. Seriously good, it shows all the hallmarks of a flashy, important Napa Cab, with rich, perfectly sculpted tannins, a deeply impressive structure, and intense, long-lasting black currant, spice and toasty oak flavors.

130637,US,"What a roll this winery has been on the last several vintages. The '03 is huge, showing masses of forward, classic Cabernet fruit. Just erupts with dark berry-cherry, plum, boysenberry and coffee flavors with a rich, butterscotchy, gingersnap cookie note. But the tannins bite from this hilly vineyard.

130638,US,"Big and mouthfillingly juicy, a humongous Pinot with enormously ripe cherry, raspberry and vanilla pie filling flavors, and buttery, smoky oak.

130639,US,"A beautiful wine, pure and gentle yet powerful. Softer than Napa, maybe earthier, with lush red cherry and vanilla cream flavors sprinkled with a dash of crème de cassis and dusty cocoa.

130640,US,"I loved the '03. This one's right up there.

130641,US,"A Napa winemaker told me that “olive” is not a fashionable word to use with Cabernet. Maybe, but the olives here are beautiful.

130642,Australia,"Not great by Grange standards, but still a fabulous wine, the 2001 Grange boasts an intoxicating, heady bouquet of rich chocolate and coconut. It follows that up with deep, plummy fruit that's full-bodied and lush yet quite tannic, promising decades of ageability.

130645,US,"Soft, ripe and dry, this wine, with a little Merlot and Cab Franc, is largely from Beckstoffer's Tokalon Vineyard, with a dollop from the winery's Spring Mountain estate.

130649,US,"A Bordeaux blend based on Cab Franc, this is a little lighter in body than traditional Cabernet Sauvignon, but shows the hallmarks of great Napa wine in the soft, rich, sweet tannins and ultraripe cherry purée and milk chocolate flavors, compounded with rich toasty oak.",Proprietary Red Wine,92,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Corley
130650,Australia,"Rather restrained, this is a dark, concentrated wine built for some time in the cellar.

130652,Australia,"Even Jim Barry's entry-level Cabernet—The Cover Drive—is a hit.

130653,US,"Hendry has a good track record with Cabernet, and although this isn't their best effort, it's an interesting, moderately ageworthy wine.

130670,Spain,"Plenty of new oak is announced via aromas of coconut, mint, vanilla and burnt toast. but offsetting that is lively berry and cola flavors. As it opens and settles in, you get a wall of fierce tannins that aren't likely to fade any time soon.

130685,Australia,"A disappointing effort from this stalwart Clare Valley producer, but still a good wine, with pretty aromas of crushed stone, mint and lime.

130687,Italy,Sweet aromas of ripe berry fruit and some earth tones create a slightly awkward nose that lacks balance.

130688,US,"Soft, simple and superripe, almost candy-sweet, with jammy cherry and raspberry flavors. Could almost be a dessert wine. On the plus side, it's clean and vibrant. If you like your Zins cola-like, it's for you.",Old Vines Block 817,83,32.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Zinfandel,Cantara
130689,Chile,"Round and ultra oaky on the nose, with creamy mocha aromas. The palate and finish follow suit, meaning a creamy oak feel and flavor dominate.

130705,Australia,"In the heat of the 2008 vintage, it may have been a mistake to further dry 20% of the grapes for this wine.

It is packed with acidity and firm green fruits, leaving a twist of lemon and nuts on the finish.",Le Mesnil Blanc de Blancs Brut,95,300.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Salon
130772,France,"Gosset packs this prestige cuvée in a traditional skittle bottle. Almost bone dry to taste, this is full of nervous energy, pink grapefruit flavors, crisp acidity and layers of intense almond and toast flavors.",Celebris Brut,94,150.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Gosset
130773,France,"An attractively perfumed wine, with white flowers, cut grass and thyme. To taste, it is soft, with the delicacy of Chardonnay giving an elegance to the intense green, crisp flavors. This should be a long-lived wine–at least 10 years.",Grand Brut,94,85.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Gosset
130774,South Africa,"Very ripe and powerful, this Cabernet is built for aging. Dry, firm tannins overlay cassis and herbal flavors, while cedar and toast aromas come from new French wood aging. Sourced from a top Franschhoek Valley vineyard, this is impressive.",,94,46.0,Franschhoek,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Boekenhoutskloof
130775,France,"Philipponnat's 1522 cuvée is a reference to the date of the first record of Philipponnat as grape growers in Ay. It's one of their top wines, and shows off the food- friendly, rich style typical of this producer. It's ripe, rounded, full-bodied, and dominated by Pinot Noir giving it great depth of flavor. It's also a wine meant for aging.",Cuvée 1522 Grand Cru,94,85.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Philipponnat
130776,France,"A blanc de blancs, vinified in wood (15% new). It is rich, creamy, and still young with citrus and tropical fruits vying for dominance at this early stage. Wait for this wine to develop over the next five years—it will be magnificent.",Cuvée des Caudalies Grand Cru Brut,94,120.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,De Sousa & Fils
130777,South Africa,"Over a quarter of a century ago, this was one of the first South African Bordeaux blends. It is still one of the best, a ripely tannic, firm wine that owes a lot to the structure given by ripe grapes from mature vines. Great acidity, great black currant fruits, and great style.",Rubicon,94,30.0,Stellenbosch,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Meerlust
130778,France,"Gorgeous, delicious fruit, with flavors of crisp apples and lemon zest underlined by an intensity of structure and flavor. There is just great depth to this impressive wine. The only flaw is that it is too young—wait another five years.",Extra Cuvée de Réserve Blanc de Chardonnay Brut,94,99.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Pol Roger
130779,US,"Although this wine is drinkable now, it has the stuffing to improve through 2009 or so. It's absolutely delicious in forward, almost jammy red cherry, sweet rhubarb pie, cola and mocha flavors, but also has high acidity and dusty tannins, all wrapped in the most elegantly silky mouthfeel you can imagine. The minerally tightness suggests mid-term cellaring.",Rosemary's Vineyard,94,65.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Talley
130780,France,"A delicious, welcoming, generous wine that also manages to keep the pure, mineral character of Chardonnay. It has a very direct, linear, steely taste. Great acidity plays a part, as do ripe, fruity flavors and fine balance. This wine should develop well, but it's delicious now.",Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs Brut,94,150.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Taittinger
130781,France,"Dominated by Chardonnay, this wine has great depth of flavor, benefiting from the 13 years-aging on lees before disgorging.

130782,France,"Certainly an apéritif style, this is still a rich Chardonnay, toasty, developed, with white flower aromas and honey and citrus flavors, that hint at tropical fruits. This is a beautifully balanced wine, flowing through its development towards maturity, but still with good aging potential.",Amour de Deutz Blanc de Blancs Brut,94,206.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Deutz
130783,France,"Dehours makes a range of single cépage Champagnes from specific parcels of old vines. This parcel of Pinot Noir in Mareuil-le-Port was aged in wood before blending, giving a superbly ripe, quite toasty, spicy character. It does need time, and is obviously a wine for aging, but even now it has great, ripe peach and lemongrass flavors. Not imported.",Collection Blanc de Pinot Noir,94,,Champagne,Champagne,,Pinot Noir,Dehours

130785,South Africa,"Series C is the Cabernet-dominated version of a wine that brings together the winemaking talents of California winemaker Zelma Long and her viticulturist husband Phil Freese, along with Warwick Estate's Mike Ratcliffe and San Francisco-based importer Bartholemew Broadbent. Coffee, chocolate and dark berry fruits dominate this brooding wine that shows intensity and power. Yet it never becomes heavy or overripe—here there is a good sense of balance that lifts the wine, especially in the aftertaste.",Series C,94,70.0,Paarl,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Vilafonté
130786,US,"Here's a Pinot that stands out even among its appellative peers. The usual cherry and cola fruit is there, but there's a thyme-and-lavender edge that calls to mind certain southern French wines, and a savage, sweet leather and animal character that practically cries out for duck or game. The wine is very dry, fairly oaky, and young in raw, juicy acidity. Give it until 2007 to soften.",,94,60.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Wedell Cellars

130788,France,"One of the few houses still to ferment in wood (Krug is another), Alfred Gratien cultivates an intense style of wine, which has toasty, buttery characters as well as richness. From 1997, this wine is lighter than other Alfred Gratien vintages, showing more acidity than richness, but there is still a stylistic similarity there.",Brut,93,95.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Alfred Gratien
130789,US,"Made from the Dijon clones so popular in the mid-'90s, this is a tremendous wine. It's dark and vigorous, with massive cherry pie, raspberry tart, white chocolate fudge and coffee flavors, properly dry and rich in fine tannins. I have given it a point less than Wedell's outstanding '03 Pinot simply because this wine is so rich, so dense that it's lost a bit of varietal character. But there's no denying its deliciousness.",Hillside Vineyard,93,95.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Wedell Cellars
130790,US,"This is the most ageworthy of Fife's current wines, the one to put your money on. Even at this age, it's still drily tough and tannicly astringent. But it's a fine wine, and there is no doubt it has yet to show its stuff. Buried deep is a solid core of blackberry and cherry fruit yearning to get out. This is a wine to buy in multiple bottles, and begin opening in 2009, one by one. Petite Sirah and Syrah.",Max Cuvée,93,38.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Rhône-style Red Blend,Fife
130791,South Africa,"The Nieuwould family has farmed at Cederberg for five generations—hence the name. This top Cabernet from the estate vineyards comes from old vines, giving huge concentration and elegance.

130792,France,"This Deutz prestige cuvée has a blend of red and white grapes (as contrasted with the blanc de blancs Amour de Deutz).

130793,France,"Better known for its blends dominated by Pinot Noir, Roederer is following the fashion for blanc de blancs in this very dry, but ripely toasty, full-bodied Chardonnay. It has superrich fruit, but still keeps a sense of proportion in its acidity and green plum flavors.",Blanc de Blancs Brut,93,74.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Louis Roederer
130794,US,"As full-flavored as this is, it maintains the delicate elegance Pinot should have. It strikes the palate with great balance, a composite of fine acidity, easy but complex tannins, and superb cherry, tea and oak flavors with an underlying minerality. Showcases the greatness of Arroyo Grande Valley as a source of some of the best Pinots from California.",Les Galets,93,60.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Laetitia
130795,Portugal,"Slightly richer than the Charleston Sercial, the Boston Bual boasts knockout aromas of toasted nut oil, orange peel and hints of dark honey or maple syrup.

130796,US,"Oh, what a rich Zin this is. It's like biting into a chocolate truffle that melts in your mouth. Then comes the blackberry liqueur, cherry pie, cinnamon roll.

130797,France,"Very dry on the palate, this is nevertheless a rich, full-bodied wine, from a parcel of old vines. The flavors are still young, but show the promise of intense fruitiness, white fruits, and currants. Just a touch of toastiness reveals the fact the wine was aged in barrels before blending.",Collection Blanc de Pinot Noir,93,37.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Pinot Noir,Dehours
130798,France,"A tour de force from this cooperative, whose vines are concentrated in the grand cru vineyards of Mailly.

This is still young, and will certainly age.",Les Echansons,93,89.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Mailly Grand Cru
130799,US,"For many wineries, this would be their top Pinot. For Rochioli, it's their basic bottling.

130802,Spain,"Having never tried this Viura-Malvasia blend before, we say it's nicely done. The nose rings of baked apple and deftly applied oak, while the palate is fresh but also deep and textured. Flavors of apple and pear are accented by vanilla and toast, and overall it's composed and shows character. Drink now through 2012. Only 250 cases made.",1894,89,50.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,White Blend,Cosme Palacio y Hermanos

130804,US,"With alcohol under 13%, this spicy, well-constructed Pinot Gris is decidedly cut in a European mold.

130806,Portugal,"Initially, this is a fruit-dominated wine, with a cherries-in-syrup flavor. Only gradually do the tannins and the stalky but rich texture come in to suggest aging potential. The wine finishes with the fresh edge typical of 2007.",Conceito Vintage,89,61.0,Port,,,Port,Conceito Vinhos

130808,France,"Almost half of this wine's production of 1,800 cases came to the U.S., which should make this broad, mouthfilling white relatively easy to find.

130809,Spain,"Despite its age, you can still smell sawdust, dry oak and resin on the nose. The palate is acidic and drying, with tight plum, cola and raspberry flavors.

130818,France,"With its dry, tight texture, this is an austere wine. The fruit is full of piercing black currant acidity, structured with firm tannins.

130832,US,"Imagine a Sauvignon Blanc with the weight of Chardonnay, and that's what you get with this single-vineyard wine. It's amazing, because the wine never saw oak. Still, it has a vanilla richness on top of pineapple, peach, anise and honeysuckle flavors. Maybe the correct comparison is of a white Cabernet Sauvignon, with the complexity that implies.

130833,US,"This is always a drily tannic wine in its youth, but it's also one of the most ambitious Cabs produced from Dry Creek Valley, and is worth attention. With a drop of Petit Verdot, it's young and jammy, explosive in black currant and chocolate flavors, with plenty of smoky oak. Although the tannins are big, they're completely ripe and sweet. Four-plus years of age have softened them.

130835,Spain,"Potent and raring to go, with lots of young oak and intense fruit that causes the wine to change in the glass in the blink of an eye. What we can tell at this early point of development is that it is saturated, healthy, balanced and clean. There's vibrancy and full tannins, with lip-smacking acidity.

130848,US,"Give this dramatic young Pinot time to grow up. It's super-young in jammy cherry, raspberry, licorice, cola and smoky new oak flavors, and while the tannic-acid structure is first-rate, it's a little too unresolved for full enjoyment.

130851,Italy,"Cabernet and Merlot are combined in 70-30 proportions. The aromas are elegant and tightly packed: Cherry, blackberry, molasses, maple syrup and tobacco leaf make up the core.

130852,US,"This is a gorgeous Cabernet, but it's pretty young, and while it's delicious now due to the ripe fruit, it really needs time. Wrapped in fresh, tight tannins, it displays powerful red and black currant, blackberry, cherry, chocolate and vanilla oak flavors, and shows the elegant, important mouthfeel of a top Napa Cab. Give it until after 2008, if you can keep your hands off, and will come into its own after 2010.",Estate Grown,93,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clark-Clauden
130853,Italy,"This vintage of this Cab-Sangiovese-Merlot blend is uniquely attractive and refined, offering a modern, direct approach and delivers pristine aromas of black cherry, blackberry, exotic spice, leather and pipe tobacco. In the mouth, it boasts thick tannins and excellent length.",Excelsus,93,81.0,Tuscany,Sant'Antimo,,Red Blend,Castello Banfi
130854,Italy,"Lupicaia (a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot) is said to be influenced by the eucalyptus trees that border the vineyard. Indeed, spicy green notes reminiscent of pungent peppercorn distinguish this wine and are at the core of a complex embroidery of aromas that include black fruit, spice and vanilla. Hold for five years.",Lupicaia,93,180.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Castello del Terriccio
130855,Italy,"Proprietor Maurizio Fuselli's 100% Syrah from coastal Tuscany—his debut vintage—could not be more encouraging.

130856,Italy,"This vintage of Solengo is slightly more floral and delicate when compared to the more robust and generous 2004 vintage.

130858,Australia,"Brian Croser's efforts with Tiers Vineyard Chardonnay have finally paid off in a big way.

130859,US,"A worthy followup to the '05, possibly even richer and more balanced.

Short, slightly sharp finish.",Portfolio Collection,80,26.0,Pennsylvania,Pennsylvania,,Chambourcin,Chaddsford
130871,Chile,"Right off the bat this fails to impress. The nose has a chemical-like burn and weird, unfamiliar aromas. All this portends an industrial-tasting wine with odd infiltrations of butter and green vegetables. Barely acceptable.",,80,10.0,Central Valley,,,Carmenère,Corinto

130876,Australia,"Starts off with mulberry, cola, vanilla and clove, and persists that way across the creamy-textured palate.

130877,Uruguay,"While this ranks as one of the best Uruguayan reds we've come across, it's not a slam dunk. First off, there's the price; $60 is a lot to spend for any wine, let alone one from the frontier. But getting past that there's pretty fruit, purity, texture and balance to this prestige-aimed effort. And it finishes with alluring tobacco and earth notes. The blend is Cab Franc with Merlot, Tannat and Cab Sauvignon.",El Preciado Premier Gran Reserva,89,60.0,San Jose,,,Red Blend,Castillo Viejo
130878,Uruguay,"Weighty and rich, but the melon core to this Uruguayan Viognier is solid. The palate pumps round apple with walnut shadings, and the finish goes to melon, papaya and banana.

130879,Uruguay,"Earth, saddle leather and roasted berry aromas lead the meaty nose to a round, mildly tanninc palate that's holding full plum and berry flavors.

Good by local standards.",Adagio Espressivo,86,30.0,Canelones,,,Red Blend,Toscanini
130880,Uruguay,"Among the Uruguayan wines we've tried more than once, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Tannat and Merlot has integrity. It's light and herbal on the nose, with red fruit and spearmint aromas leading to a palate of cherry and red raspberry. Feelwise, it's tight and tough, but with food it will show fairly well.",Rio Colorado,86,35.0,El Colorado,,,Red Blend,DeLucca
130881,Uruguay,"Maybe this wine weighs in a bit stewy and heavy, but along the way it has some virtues, namely an attractive rum-raisin quality to the bouquet and intense black-fruit flavors. It's a chunky wine that stumbles along the palate, but you have to admire it's richness and stuffing. The blend is Tannat, Cabernet and Merlot.",TCM,85,19.0,Canelones,,,Red Blend,Toscanini
130882,Uruguay,"This blend of several grapes led by Tannat is a touch gritty and stewed. Yes, it has its qualities such as jammy berry and a nice, fleshy feel.

130883,Uruguay,"Buttercup and other flowery aromas give it a good start. The palate is fairly plump and creamy, with apricot, melon and nutty flavors. Toward the finish it tilts a little toward banana. Not typical Viognier, but this is Uruguay.",Posada Del Virrey Reserve,84,13.0,Colonia,,,Viognier,Dante Irurtia
130884,Uruguay,"Deep and baked on the nose, with soft, fleshy blackberry and plum flavors. On the palate the wine's tannins are tame and the fruit seems exceedingly rich.

130886,Uruguay,"Very expensive for a novelty, and without coming down too hard on it, it's fat and raisiny with a heavy ripeness that is tough to swallow.

130887,France,"A big, rich wine, showing its gorgeous fruit easily. But with a core of dryness, the ripest apricots touched by caramel, it should age well over many years.

130889,Spain,"Beautifully composed, with power and just as much precision and pizzazz. The nose offers lightly baked berry fruit notes, leather and spice, while the palate is loaded with tobacco, exotic spices and the finest natural berry flavors Spain has to offer.

130890,Austria,"A very direct wine, which just shouts Pinot Noir. There's no mistaking the ripe cherry aromas and fresh fruit, packed with acidity, just edged by some rustic character. The tannins are here, but the fruit is overwhelming.",Reserve,89,40.0,Kremstal,,,Pinot Noir,Malat
130891,Italy,"This producer buys wine to age and bottle under the estate label.

130892,Argentina,"Like its little brother Calvulcura, this wine is Cabernet Sauvignon mixed with Merlot. It's a big boy with stewed berries, prune and licorice on the bouquet. Below that heavy nose is a palate that's sweet and ripe, and arguably too much so.

130894,Austria,"A firmly tannic, young Pinot Noir with red berry fruits under this strong surface dryness.

Cécile is Willi Bründlmayer's daughter.",Cécile,89,62.0,Kamptal,,,Pinot Noir,Bründlmayer
130895,Argentina,"Movie popcorn, baked fruits and plenty of toast and vanilla work the entry, while forward flavors of apple and pear are kicked up a notch by full acidity.

130897,Italy,"Despite its deep concentration and evident power, here is a food-friendly wine (think pheasant stuffed with mushrooms or polenta with wild boar) that balances brawn with soft tones of vanilla, nut and bright fruit.

130899,Austria,"Pure strawberry aromas lead in to delicious, ripe, sweet fruits. It shows the highly drinkable nature of the St. Laurent grape, with red cherry fruits and light touch of tannin.

130901,Germany,"Intensely sweet, as you might expect, with scents of honey, dried apricots and clover.

130902,Austria,"A single-vineyard Pinot Noir, full of ripe, juicy, fresh fruit that is rounded and filled out with wood aging and flavors of vanilla. But at the heart this remains a red berry and cherry fruit-flavored wine. Screwcap.",Siglos,89,30.0,Burgenland,,,Pinot Noir,Gesellmann
130903,Italy,"This base Amarone comes from a company in rapid expansion thanks to smart investments in the vineyard (100 acres) and winery.

130905,Germany,"A strongly minerally wine, the 2005 Maria v. O. boasts perfumes of heating oil and smoke, while the flavors are of apple, pear and citrus, all wrapped in a petrolly shroud.

130906,Argentina,"Round, pretty and ripe; a dead knock-off for modern-style Rioja. There are sun-baked aromas but not the cooked type, with a palate that pushes dark berry flavors and chocolate.

130907,US,"Great Zin. It's robust and brawny, in the way of Zin, with the rustic wild berry, nettle, chamomile and spice flavors you expect from the variety, but shows good control in the smooth tannins and modulated alcohol.

130911,Argentina,"A blasting bouquet of oak and affiliated cinnamon and spice are wave one, while next up there's dark fruit and a wealth of vanilla.

130916,Argentina,"If you want ripe-fruit aromas and flavors along with spice, pepper and coffee accents, this well-oaked but reasonably restrained Malbec is your ticket.

Young and juicy, it's delicious now, and should develop through 2012.",Landslide Vineyard,92,33.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Simi
130933,US,"Rich as sin, the '04 Rockpile Zin got enormously ripe but has been fermented to dryness, at the cost of very high alcohol. The flavors are a wonder. It's all about chocolate, crème de cassis, anisette, and the most wonderfully rich, spicy buttery, toasty vanilla bean.",Rockpile Road Vineyard,92,35.0,California,Rockpile,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rosenblum
130934,Australia,"Winemaker Roman Bratasuik calls Kangarilla “quite a warm spot,” and that character is evident in this wine's dark blackberry and plum flavors, soft, open-knit texture and warmth on the finish. It's a lush, sexy wine with tons of appeal in its youth—why wait?",Kangarilla,92,70.0,South Australia,Clarendon,,Grenache,Clarendon Hills
130935,US,"Owner Kenny Kahn reserves the “Best Barrel” designation for his best wine. This year it's a Malbec. Pours inky black, and explodes with blackberry pie filling, chocolate, plum sauce, licorice and cedar aromas. Drinks as powerfully rich as it smells, offering immense flavors and luxuriously smooth, velvety tannins. Very soft. Drink now through 2009 before the fruit fades.",Best Barrel,92,75.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Malbec,Blue Rock
130936,US,"Immensely ripe, just explosive in young Cabernet flavors, and wrapped in those Howell tannins that require extensive cellaring. The wine, nearly 100% Cab, is totally dry and very oaky, from 100% new, small French barrels. But it's easily big enough in black currant, cherry and cocoa flavors to handle all that wood. Drinkable now, after decanting, with rich, fatty meats, and through 2020.",,92,86.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Atlas Peak
130937,US,"Dark, ripe and tannic, it's an ager, but there's something about it now that's instantly appealing. It is a dry wine but with a honeyed sweetness and glyceriney richness. Oozes blackberry, lead pencil, currant, cedar and mocha flavors leading to a long, balanced finish.",Reserve,92,70.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frank Family
130938,US,"This is a very fine Cabernet Sauvignon-based wine. It's immense in extracted black currant and chocolate flavors that are framed in soft, luxurious tannins. Acidity is soft, too, but adequate. The overall impression is of high quality. Despite the mountain origin, it doesn't seem like an ager, though, so drink now through 2009.",Elivette Reserve,92,90.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Blend,Spring Mountain Vineyard
130939,US,"There aren't a lot of wines coming off this appellation, and most of them are red. But this is a wonderful Chard. Ripe and detailed, it combines tropical fruit, mineral and oak flavors, and is dry and tart in acids. This is one of the few California Chardonnays I would age for up to ten years.",Du Pratt Vineyard,92,28.0,California,Mendocino Ridge,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Chardonnay,Steele
130940,US,"The vineyard is in the Green Valley, and the acidity is very high, giving a bright purity to the kiwi, Key lime pie, pineapple custard and crème brûlée flavors.

White Burgundy is the model, expressed California-style.",Keefer Ranch,92,28.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Armida
130941,US,"Juslyn's top wine is just under the legal limit to call it Cabernet Sauvignon. It's surprisingly soft and accessible for a Spring Mountain Cab, offering immediate pleasure with its juicy, upfront blackberry liqueur and cocoa flavors. It's certainly a complex, balanced, elegant wine, and quite drinkable now. But it should hold and even improve for a decade.",Estate Red Wine,92,90.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Blend,Juslyn Vineyards
130942,Australia,"It's nice to know that some Australian wineries and importers have kept a lid on prices. Reilly's 2003 Old Bushvine is a 75-25 blend that showcases Grenache's soft, caressing texture. It's full-bodied but silky, with sweetly ripe cherries matched by bold lashings of vanilla and spiced with hints of clove and cinnamon. Drink now.",Old Bushvine,92,17.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Grenache-Shiraz,Reilly's
130943,US,"Shows all the hallmarks of great Mondavi Reserve. Ageworthy and complex, with enormously ripe, rich fruit, classic chocolate, cassis plus cream and spice from new oak.

130945,US,"Plenty of richness here, mangoes, pineapple custard, Key lime pie, not to mention smoky, caramelly, butterscotchy oak, but there's also a streamlined, sleek minerality that leaves a lip-smacking steely feeling behind. Part of that is acidity. Really fine wine.",Bien Nacido Vineyard,92,28.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Steele
130946,US,"Here's a young Cabernet that's rich in complex, sweet tannins. The fruit shows all the hallmarks of the vintage, wonderfully ripe in blackberry, cherry, blueberry and chocolate flavors with an extravagant coating of toasty new oak.

130947,US,"The winery's Calistoga Cabernet is lush and opulent. This one is much firmer in acids and tannins, a more structured wine, although equally oaky, but it needs cellaring to show its best.

Alberto,91,38.0,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Malbec,Bodega Noemía de Patagonia
130950,Spain,"This wine is made from old-vines Verdejo and it shows more minerality and intensity than something made from younger grapes. The nose has wax, mineral and citrus aromas, while the palate shows passion fruit and pineapple flavors. Grows on you nicely with structure, acidity and a smack of Rueda terroir.",Finca la Colina Cien X Cien,89,23.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Vinos Sanz
130951,Italy,"The emphasis here is the purity of territory-driven aromas: You'll get distinct volcanic notes of granite, campfire, pencil lead and minerals. There's little fruit here, but the tannins are very firm and dusty. This 50-50 Aglianico and Piedirosso blend has highly recognizable qualities that identify its southern Italian origins.",Conte Artús,89,19.0,Southern Italy,Sant' Agata dei Goti,,Red Blend,Mustilli
130952,US,"This may be a wrong estimate, but the wine tastes like it was made from younger vines in this large vineyard. It has that fresh, rude, jammy quality that trades complexity and ageworthiness for immediate appeal.

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Roessler
130953,Australia,"Softer and more approachable than the winery's powerful 2005, this wine offers lush plum, leather and loam notes, accented by a touch of cracked pepper.

130954,US,"This is a high acid style of Chardonnay, reflective of a vintage that was one of the coolest in a decade or more.

130955,US,"This is quite a hefty young Chard. It takes the basic elements of ripe, potent fruit, oak, and Burgundian-inspired technique and elevates it all, a Chard on steroids. The peach, tropical fruit, pear, candied ginger and charry oak flavors have an acidic scour. Drink now and for the next 5 years.",Vintner Select Cuvée,89,47.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Pride Mountain
130956,Argentina,"Black plum, cola and chocolate define this textbook Malbec. The wine has body, heft and lots of fruit, but also some complexity and character. Flavors of black cherry, plum and cassis are layered and fairly boisterous, while the mouthfeel is firm and just slightly tannic. Just right for red meats and pastas.",Premium,89,12.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Piattelli
130957,Argentina,"Initial aromas of clove and cinnamon suggest a lot of barrel action, but give it a few minutes and the wine settles on ripe black fruit, dark spice notes and richness.

130960,US,"With no oak, the pure, brilliantly ripe Chardonnay fruit shines through in this rewarding wine.

130963,Spain,"The gold tint may look imposing, and it does signal a richer-styled wine. But let this heavier, more ripe Albariño roll over your palate and you'll probably wind up liking its citrus and nectarine flavors but softer body. Finishes with apricot, kumquat and vanilla notes. An interesting wine to drink now.",Premium,89,17.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Valdumia
130964,Australia,"A crisp medium-bodied Cab with good varietal definition, Strathewen Hill's 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon boasts slightly minty cassis-inflected fruit, vanilla and chocolate notes and a smooth mouthfeel.

130967,Australia,"Textbook Coonawarra Cabernet, with touches of minty herbs embellishing cassis and cedar. It's medium-bodied, with a refined tannic structure and touches of smoke on the finish.

130969,Australia,"Everything about this wine is big, from the boisterous nose of cassis, herbs and tobacco, to the bold flavors of cassis, vanilla and tobacco. The finish is long and loud, like the volume's been turned way up. Ultimately, it lacks a bit of elegance and finesse; if that emerges with aging, this rating will seem conservative.",The Coppermine Road,89,65.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Cabernet Sauvignon,D'Arenberg
130970,US,"Although this is a rather light and tart wine, it has unusual flavors of cured ham and lots of herbal power in the finish, which is leafy and tannic. It might be better as a component in a blend, but as a stand-alone it shows some genuine terroir.",Ridgecrest Vineyard,89,44.0,Oregon,Ribbon Ridge,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Chehalem
130971,Italy,"Aged 15 years in oak, Donnafranca Marsala is a new product from these historic cellars with notes of resin, maple syrup and honey roasted almonds.

130972,Australia,"A very good effort, this may be among the last great values to emerge from Australia, as smaller crops and changing currencies will undoubtedly take their toll. It's remarkable that McLaren Vale fruit can go into a $12 bottle. Black cherry fruit is presented on a medium-bodied, softly tannic frame, embellished by hints of cola and eucalyptus. Finishes soft, with a fine texture of charcoal dust and lingering cassis flavors.",,89,12.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Razor's Edge
130973,US,"Il Luce is a new vineyard, adjacent to Abetina and just one acre in size. This young wine shares a similar high acid tang with its much older sibling, reminiscent of fresh orange juice, and the acids are wrapped into tannic, medium dark cherry fruit. Flavors of chocolate and espresso peek out behind the ripe tannins. The Abetina has more subtle depth, but this shares a very similar weight and balance. It promises good things in the future.",Il Luce Vineyard,89,100.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Ponzi
130974,Argentina,"Cola, blackberry and cassis dominate the bouquet, with cedar making a cameo. The palate shows no shortage of tannins, while the flavors yield to the usual suspects: cassis, black fruit, etc. To call it a young buck would be accurate. It's tough, robust and tannic, yet there's a lot of fruit and power to uncover.",Premium,89,12.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Piattelli
130975,Argentina,"The nose is forceful and strong, with char and the dark-fruit aromas that Shiraz and Malbec are known for. The palate pops along, propelled by healthy acids and moderate tannins. And the finish is fairly plush before it fades away quietly. A little more depth and length and we'd really be singing this wine's praises. As is, it's a rock-solid blend.",Estate,88,16.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Shiraz-Malbec,Doña Paula

130982,US,"This is quite a fine Zinfandel that shows the benefits of a relatively cool vintage in Paso Robles. The fruit is entirely ripe, but without the Porty sweetness that can mar Paso reds in a hot year.

130985,Italy,"You'll love the beautiful clarity of aromas that this pristine, fragrant wine offers: citrus fruit, peach, honey and sweet exotic fruit.

130986,Argentina,"Root beer and tree bark aromas give this a rooty, savory, almost baked quality. But the palate is ripe and pure, with cassis, black cherry and fresh prune flavors.

130990,US,"This Syrah does what Paso does so well with big reds. It's soft and lusciously fruity and almost decadent.

130992,Argentina,"This is probably the best varietal-level Chardonnay Norton has produced. It's oak-tipped, with butterscotch and spice aromas offering some character to the nose.

130999,US,"There's real richness in the fruit of this dry wine. It just explodes in blackberry, cassis, blueberry and cranberry flavor. The oak influence, while subtle, adds notes of toast.

131000,US,"A Cab/Merlot/Syrah blend, it's full-bodied and tastes of grapes and cherries. It has a firmly tannic spine that carries it solidly past the first impressions of pretty fruit and into more substantial territory.

131012,Chile,"Dry, earthy and leafy, with herbal red-fruit aromas. The palate has a lean scratchiness to it along with snappy, drying, roasted berry flavors. Burns a bit on the finish and overall it doesn't bring enough body and ripeness to the table.",Armador,83,12.0,Maipo Valley,,,Merlot,Odfjell
131013,US,"Good blackberry fruit in this wine, but the tannins are pretty strong, and so is the acidity, which gives a sharp, green mint feeling that grows stronger through the finish. Ready now.",,83,24.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Syrah,San Simeon

131015,US,"Stiff and leathery, this 100% varietal Carmenère is barely ripe, with alcohol at 12.6% and green, stemmy tannins.

131019,Italy,"There are pungent aromas here of alcohol and fruit, that when coupled with the wine's naturally high acidity, rip through the palate with determination and force.

131022,Chile,"Oily, chunky and smelling of cider. The palate seems more flat and cloying than it should be for Casablanca, and the flavors are jumbled melon and generic tropical fruits.

131051,US,"Just delicious, a really fine Syrah notable for its balance and complexity. Dry and smoky, it has plum, blackberry and coffee flavors, with a streak of sweet anise and leather.

131052,France,"From a 3.75-acre parcel of this grand cru, this is stunning red Burgundy, amazingly complex, lushly fruited and—yes—ageworthy.

131057,France,"From the ripe, open 1995 vintage, this is a round wine with flavors of lemons, grapefruits and almonds. The angles of acidity have been turned into curves as it develops and softens.

131058,South Africa,"A big, fat, juicy wine that nonetheless preserves elegance and freshness. There's a touch of eucalyptus and mint, plus an  herbal character.

Give it three to four years before opening.",,93,27.0,Stellenbosch,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Waterford
131059,US,"Dense, delicious and dry, this Cab comes from between the Silverado Trail and the Vaca Mountains.

131060,Argentina,When this powerhouse icon red was introduced with the '97 vintage it was heavily weighted to Cabernet Sauvignon. But now Malbec accounts for 32% of the blend. The result in this excellent year is a forward wine with laser-beam acidity framing bright blueberry and cassis flavors. It has perfect structure and avoids any of the softness and heaviness that sometimes plague New World super reds.

131061,France,"Creamy, fruity aromas already suggest a light, frothy wine. And that's just what this is, fulfilling all the specifications for a rosé.

131062,France,"A superbly ripe Champagne that has all the open generosity of the 1998 vintage. Peach and apricot aromas are followed by flavors of hazelnuts, honey and spices.

131063,US,"Only 500 cases of this intense, immature wine were produced. Grenache brings bright red cherries, while Syrah contributes weight and tannins and a darker, more brooding streak.

131064,US,"Somehow, Kent Rosenblum has figured out how to craft these big, high-alcohol, hot-country Zins and keep them balanced and dry. This single-vineyard Zin bursts with chocolate-filled raspberry and cherry candy flavors, and the alcoholic heat actually works with the wine, lending it a toasted pepper note. What a California experience.",Richard Sauret Vineyards,92,25.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Rosenblum
131065,South Africa,"The second vintage from this joint venture between Remhoogte owner Murray Boustred and new partner Michel Rolland. This blend includes Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinotage. It is an impressively perfumed wine that gets away from the juicy Pinotage flavors and goes for a densely packed, woody taste, with great black plum flavors.",Bonne Nouvelle,92,45.0,Stellenbosch,,,Cabernet Blend,Remhoogte
131066,South Africa,"The estate wine from Remhoogte in which Michel Rolland is both consultant and partner. This Bordeaux Blend is serious stuff with dry tannins that promise good aging.

131068,New Zealand,"Toasty and mealy on the nose, but those characters are well balanced by honeyed peach and citrus scents. Tasted over two days, on the first it seemed quite open and welcoming, lush and richly textured, while on the second it had closed down a bit and seemed tighter and more citrusy. Finishes long, with marked smoky notes.",,92,45.0,Martinborough,,,Chardonnay,Dry River
131069,New Zealand,"This, one of New Zealand's cult wines, should retail for about $85 when it hits a select few retailers' shelves this fall. Although not perhaps the strongest vintage in Martinborough, the 2004 Dry River Pinot Noir features incredibly kaleidoscopic forward fruit that ranges from cherry to plum to mixed berries and back again. It's lush and round, yet still structured to age, with a long, silky finish.",,92,,Martinborough,,,Pinot Noir,Dry River
131070,US,"Tasted in March, 2009, this Pinot was dark, rich and tannic. Clearly too young to really show its best now. But it's an ager. Give it three or four years to let all the parts come together, when the cherries, blackberries, spices and oak should begin to become silky and sweet. Will improve through 2015.",Ashley's,94,50.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Fess Parker
131071,US,"This Cab is built for the cellar. Don't even think of touching it before 2010, and even then, it will still be tannicly tough.

131072,US,"A polished and classic Stags Leap Cab, showing the velvet glove quality of approachability, but the iron fist of ageability.

Complex and compelling.",Mesa,94,50.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Riverbench
131076,US,"The 2002 Cabernet Sauvignon was the only other stand-alone Cab made from Rulo. This is 100% Cabernet, and a pure expression of Red Mountain. That purity is a hallmark of Rulo; clean and expressive, with a tight focus. Dense, ripe, black fruits, black olive, earth and rock, with a kiss of spice.

131078,Argentina,"Adrianna is a higher-elevation, higher-acid single-vineyard Malbec, and it's a component of the otherworldly Argentino blend. On its own, it's fresh, healthy and sturdy. The nose offers smoky, jerky, rubber and black-fruit aromas, which are backed by exotic herb, plum and boysenberry flavors. Firm, delicious and finely structured. Drink now through 2012.",Adrianna Vineyard,93,123.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
131079,US,"This bottling, which is Randall Grahm's hommage to the Northern Rhône, has varied over the vintages, but with this 2006, hits the mark as never before. Made with a splash of Grenache, it's full-bodied, bone dry and compelling in the intricacy of flavors. The blackberries, black cherries, licorice, and raspberries have elements of roasted meats and wild mushrooms sautéed in butter, tamari and a few drops of balsamic, liberally dusted with black pepper. Unique and compelling, and should develop over the next six years.",Le Pousseur,93,20.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Syrah,Bonny Doon
131080,France,"Moody, complex and brooding, this is a superb wine and an exceptional value.

131081,US,"This new Uriah marks a return to form; big, brawny, chewy and complex, yet generous and complete. The blend continues as before—54% Merlot, 33% Cab Franc, 7% Petit Verdot, and 6% Malbec, all estate-grown. The wine opens with barrel scents and flavors of tea, tobacco and wood smoke. The cherry-flavored fruit saturates the tobacco notes, gaining mass and turning into cherry cobbler as it does.",Uriah Red Wine,93,50.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Spring Valley Vineyard
131082,US,"This is all Clifton vineyard fruit and 100% varietal. It is superb; dense, laced with smoke, lightly peppery, tight, supple and extremely concentrated.

Great middle, good length.",Silo Reserve,93,35.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Rulo

131086,US,"This is Merry Edwards' personal vineyard, and as the vines gain age, the wines get better and better. The 2006 is young and grapey and needs time in the cellar to come around. It's a powerhouse of a wine, stuffed with black and red cherry, currant, Dr. Pepper and Asian spice flavors. Impresses for the sheer depth of flavor and overall balance. Best after 2010, if you can keep your hands off it.",Meredith Estate,93,54.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
131087,US,"All estate-grown and barrel fermented, this ripe and delicious white wine opens with scents of sweet hay, then is quickly wrapped in flavors of lemon zest, grapefruit and candied citrus. There's a dusty note as well, and the richness keeps bringing in more nuances—of English Breakfast tea, sweet stone fruits and lightly tropical papaya. Supple, round and luscious, it has excellent length and a clean exit.",,93,18.0,Washington,Snipes Mountain,Columbia Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Upland Estates
131088,US,"A blend of several vineyards located near the winery, in the valley's famed Middle Reach, this is the biggest and richest of Williams Selyem's Spring 2007 releases.

131091,US,"This is a seriously good Pinot. It's easy to imagine drinking it at a great restaurant, with a fabulous steak. The tannin-acid structure is just perfect, and the texture is silky. Yet tasted at the age 18 months, it's a bit heavy in jammy cherries and raspberries, which suggests aging. Try holding off until 2011–2015.",Toboni Vineyard,93,56.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista

131093,US,"There's a fine Pinot in here, but it's like buried treasure. Currently locked down with tannins, the wine shows extravagant flavors of dusty Asian spices, rhubarb, pomegranate, cola, cherryskin and sandalwood. Desperately needs time, but should be very fine. Drink 2011 through 2015.",Bien Nacido Vineyard,93,50.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Fess Parker
131094,US,"This is a reserve bottling of Goldschmidt's regular Vyborny bottling. It's essentially the same wine, but far more tannic, and perhaps a touch more concentrated. Dustily dry and astringent now, it seems like a guaranteed cellar candidate, with its rich core of blackberries, currants, mocha, herbs, anise and cedar. Better after 2011, and for many years.",Single Vineyard Selection Vyborny Vineyard Plus,93,150.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt
131095,US,"For the first time the fruit was sourced from Conner Lee vineyard old vines. It's a glorious wine, a near-perfect mix of citrus and stone, kissed with honey and dust, lightly buttery. Fermented mostly with native yeast, this is one of the best Washington Chardonnays of a very good vintage.",,93,32.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,JM Cellars
131096,Spain,"Dense and dark, with huge black-fruit aromas, toasty oak, chocolate and balsamic notes. Numanthia is ripe, rugged and intense, with in-your-face black fruit, coffee and burnt-toast accents. The feel and finish are deep as a cool well, and smooth as a whistle. Masculine to the max, and pretty close to being ready to drink. Best to hold until the fall or winter. 12,000 cases made.",Numanthia,93,60.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia
131097,US,"This lush, intricate and complex Pinot Noir really brings out the best of Russian River Valley. The fruit is enormously ripe, suggesting mashed cherries, blackberry jam, red licorice, cola and peppery spices, and the tannin-acid structure is just about perfect. The texture is right down the middle between silky-light and full-bodied. Beautiful now and through 2012.",Salzgeber Vineyard,93,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WesMar
131098,US,"This is always a tight, dry, tannic Pinot Noir due to its cool, low-yielding vineyard. The '06 is a very fine example. It's astringent and closed, but with a luscious heart of black cherries, red currants and Dr. Pepper cola. With decanting, it's fine now with something rich, like wild mushroom risotto, and should develop through 2012.",Wildcat Mountain Vineyard,93,40.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacRostie
131099,Hungary,"A deep, lush nose of honey, marmalade and lemon leads into fresh, bright fruit and acid undertones melded with luscious honey, orange peel and quince.

131100,US,"This Cab-based Bordeaux blend is very dense in fruit and also very Tannic with a capital T. Such is the astringency that it may never go away before the blackberry and black currant fruit drops out. Nonetheless it's dry and savory and, in its own Rockpiley way, classic. Drink with superrich barbecue, well-marbled grilled beef and such. Tasted twice.",Buck Pasture,89,50.0,California,Rockpile,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Mauritson
131101,Greece,"Succulent raisins, red berries and spice lead this enticing red from Greece. Fine tannins, an elegant, soft mouthfeel, and layers of dark fruit, cedar and cocoa add to the appeal. A lovely wine with a poised character.",Hgemon Grande Réserve,89,65.0,Nemea,,,Agiorgitiko,Nemeion Estate
131102,France,"Starts off scents with toasted hazelnut that give it an almost white Burgundy-like bouquet, then adds crisp, linear notes of citrus.

131103,Portugal,"A wine that is layered with new wood that dominates the fruit. The tannins are all from this wood, freshly sawn, leaving the obviously fine fruit lagging behind. It needs at least three years to come into balance.",Quinta de Ventozelo Reserva,89,25.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta de Ventozelo
131104,US,"Made in a very oaky, Sonoma Coast style that emphasizes enormously ripe fruit and crisp acids.

131105,France,"Like most Tardieu Laurent wines, this is lushly textured stuff. Honey and peach notes mingle easily on the nose and in the mouth, fading out just a little too quickly on the finish.

131106,US,"The fine vineyard expresses itself in the ripe flavors and textural balance of this Pinot Noir. It shows flavors of baked cherries, red currants and cola, with smoky pie crust notes from oak. A bit tight and aloof, so give it a good decant. Now–2012.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,89,40.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sonnet
131107,Italy,"Tight, polished and bright, this expression of Nebbiolo (with 10% Vespolina) would pair with game meat, pork ribs or succulent lamb chops.

131108,US,"Very rich in blackberries and cassis, with an herbal grounding of sage and tobacco and a dusting of freshly crushed black pepper. You'll find hard-edged tannins and some sharpness to the mouthfeel. A few years of aging are warranted, but this isn't a wine for the long haul. Decant if you drink it now.",,89,35.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mauritson
131109,France,"Filled to the brim with bold upfront fruit--peaches and pears tinged with honey and truffle--the chief possible complaint is a certain lack of subtlety (who really needs it?).

131110,US,"Oranges and tangerines are the dominant flavors of this lively, dry white wine. It's marked by brisk acidity, with a touch of creamy oak.

131111,Portugal,"The second wine of the Bruno Prats and Symington family joint venture, this is a deliciously fruity wine, but with a fine elegant backbone of light tannins and smoky wood.

131112,Portugal,"Perfumed wine, deliciously aromatic but also structured. This is balanced, intently tannic.

131114,France,"Siaurac, at 153 acres, is the largest estate in Lalande de Pomerol. The 2007 shows the relative lightness of the vintage, but boosts it up with chocolate and dark plum flavors. The wine finishes freshly, but still with tight tannins.",,89,31.0,Bordeaux,Lalande de Pomerol,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Siaurac
131115,France,"This nicely made Crozes features plenty of heft, but also a sense of focus and freshness that gives it immediate appeal.

131117,US,"This barrel selection actually was given less exposure to new French oak than the estate bottling, a telling fact, which demonstrates Anam Cara's commitment to fruit and terroir.

131119,US,"Outside of a couple of Michigan wineries, Adelsheim may be the only domestic producer of this obscure white grape, a cross between Pinot Noir and Gouais Blanc.

131120,Spain,"An earthy, bulky wine with aromas of saddle leather, crushed spice and raisin. The palate is snappier than the bouquet, as blackberry and plum fruit show accents of dill, herbs, leather and soy sauce. A legitimate, muscular Rioja made in the so-called modern style. Drink now through 2014.",Jarrarte,89,33.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Abel Mendoza
131121,Spain,"On the spot and sweet, with black cherry and roundness on the nose. Plays above its price league via ripe plum and berry flavors, bounce, body and build.

131125,Spain,"Floral and sweet on the front side of the nose and more dark, grilled and coffee-like on the back end. The palate is more juicy and snappy than some, with no shortage of acidity.

131127,Italy,"This is an easygoing Chardonnay-based sparkling wine (made in the classic method in which secondary fermentation occurs in the bottle) with pristine aromas of mature fruit and a touch of freshly baked bread. The quality of the effervescence is steady, creamy and tonic.",Brut 25,89,26.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Chardonnay,Fratelli Berlucchi
131128,Germany,"This richly concentrated wine offers plenty to like: dried apricot aromas, ripe melon and orange marmalade flavors and plenty of sugar. But there's a slightly mushroomy edge to the aromas and flavors, and this slightly fungal note persists through the finish, giving rise to some worry about how this wine will develop in bottle.",Trittenheimer Apotheke Auslese Goldkapsel,89,49.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Grans-Fassian
131129,Portugal,"Oily-textured wine, flavored with mango and peaches. It's so soft and unctuous that freshness seems to have been left behind. In its place is the ripest fruit giving an open texture and an opulent aftertaste.",Fitapreta Branco,89,15.0,Alentejano,,,Antão Vaz,Fitapreta Vinhos
131130,Spain,"Big, meaty and broad, with thick, masculine coal, pepper and blackberry aromas. This marks a nice comeback for Abadia Retuerta, which had some weak wines in 2002 and '03; this single-vineyard Syrah is lush, loaded and bursting with char, chocolate and deep fruit.

Probably better in another year or so.",Pago Garduña,93,110.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,,Syrah,Abadia Retuerta
131131,Italy,"What sets Gaja's super Tuscan apart is the extraordinary softness it offers both on the nose and in the mouth.

131132,Italy,"This vintage has some Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot in the blend to back the Sangiovese and Merlot, and is more complex and complete.

131133,US,"Mountain fruit is the key to understanding this 100% Cab. By that is meant a unique combination of firm, astringent tannins and fabulously concentrated blackberry and currant fruit that absolutely demands aging. It's obvious that the terroir these grapes come from needs an appellation other than Alexander Valley, for there's nothing soft or herbal going on here.

131134,Italy,"This Bordeaux-inspired blend (2005 is the second vintage made) represents the collaborative effort of Lodovico Antinori and Michel Rolland.

131135,Italy,"Cabernet Sauvignon blended with 10% Merlot create a vibrant wine with beautiful intensity and underlying tones of milk chocolate, prune, blueberry and spice.

131136,Italy,"The intensity of this powerhouse Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot blend is outstanding, and so is the density of its aromas.

It's bold and syrupy and overwhelms the palate with its enormous bounty.",Carmione,93,35.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Pratesi
131137,US,"Here's a Cab that makes a play for supremecy in a very crowded field. The wine, which contains a drop of Merlot, is solidly in the modern, international, Napa cult style. Soft and appealing for its blackberry, currant, plum and vanilla oak flavors, it's drinkable now, but such are the tannins that it will be better after 2008.",,93,125.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pillar Rock

131139,US,"Parducci's '03 True Grit was a sensation. The '04 is a worthy successor. Dry, tannic and amazingly rich, it floods the mouth with blackberry, cherry, currant, leather, coffee, carob and peppery spice flavors that go on and on in the finish.

131140,Italy,"This expression of Petit Verdot from Maremma in southern Tuscany boasts thick concentration and lively aromas of prune, plum, black fruit, root beer, peppercorn and licorice.

131141,US,"The vineyard, long a source for Beringer's Cabs, is in the north-central valley, east of the Silverado Trail, just below Howell Mountain. It shows the hard, tough tannins of Cabs from that neck of the woods. Flavors of red currants, cherries and cocoa are rich and vibrant, but the wine is too astringent to open now.

131142,Italy,"Smelling this wine is like entering a spice box: Saffron, cumin, cardamom and cinnamon all put in minute appearances.

131145,US,"This is from a cool, southeastern corner of the large Sonoma Coast AVA. In this cool vintage, you can taste the fog in the crisp acids and dense tannins.

131146,Italy,"Luscious, modern and concentrated, this wine delivers chocolate, exotic spice, succulent cherry, currant berry and lively buoyancy. It also has some notes that recall rubber or latex, but those don't distract.

131148,Italy,"A concentrated, inky black wine with woodshop tones that are still very evident.

131151,Spain,"In 2001 (the best Rioja vintage prior to 2004) this wine cost $15 and rated 87 points. Now it's $42 and it's worth it. Smooth and inviting on the nose, with coconut, toast and black fruit aromas. In a word, the bouquet is inviting. And the palate seals the deal; there's a creamy feel and loads of fruit and vanilla to fill the gaps.

131152,Spain,"This is far and away the best Mirto of all time. It's ripe and brawny, with bacon and black-fruit aromas that put it squarely into the Nuevo Classic mold.

131153,Italy,"This Cabernet Sauvignon emphasizes delicate, feminine aromas that are rare to find in the variety. Small berry, toasted almond and herbs are buoyant and fresh.

131155,Spain,"Complex and showing so much of what we love about Ribera del Duero. Baking spices, mature fruit and leather grace the stately bouquet, while the palate sings a pretty tune of berries, plum and brown sugar. There's thrust and potency to the mouthfeel but also a toasty, rich, mocha character. Drinking good now but should hold in there for another five to eight years.",Gran Reserva,92,75.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Alidis
131156,Italy,"A perfect collaboration between two celebrated Tuscan estates, this plush wine is stacked tall with pretty aromas of cola, sweet spice, root beer, clove, toast and forest fruit.

131160,US,"A splendid, near-perfect Pinot, although it's very young and will benefit from time in the bottle. Few Pinots offer richer, more massive flavors.

131161,US,"From the wildest, most remote and exotic stretch of the Sonoma Coast: you can taste the salt of the sea in this wine, as you can in a Manzanilla Sherry. It gives a tang to the lemondrop, pear and honeysuckle flavors, with their lick of cold granite. So pure and vibrant, so savory, so compelling. Grows more fascinating with every minute in the glass.",Estate,97,42.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Failla
131162,US,"Filled with black and red berries and stone fruits that have a smoky, grilled edge, this dramatic Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend hails from several great vineyards, mainly Stagecoach, which is up on Atlas Peak.

131164,US,"Superb, opulent, just wonderful. Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon.

131167,US,"A very fine Cab from the estate, which is in the north-central part of the Rutherford appellation. Judging from the tannins, it's too youthful to drink now, with a tight, astringent mouthfeel and fleshy, unintegrated oak. But the flavors are extraordinary. They flood the mouth with the essence of Cabernet, with ripe blackberries, black currants, raspberries and mocha, and the spicy finish lasts for a full minute. Give it until 2013, and it should provide great drinking through 2019, at least.",Red Wine,95,140.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Quintessa
131168,US,"Drier and earthier than many Napa Cabs these days, this wine has subtle sage and sweet licorice that grounds its fruitier flavors of blackberries, cherries and raspberries. Very beautiful are the tannins, which are rich and pure, suggesting perfect ripeness. The small Bosché bottling has been a premier one for the winery for many years, and this '05 is one of the best in memory. Should age effortlessly for at least a dozen years.",Bosché,95,70.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Freemark Abbey
131169,US,"What a wonderful wine. So pure, so fine and so Bordeaux-esque, like a fine young Margaux that needs time. Made from 100% Cabernet grapes, it shows classic blackberry and black currant flavors, beautifully oaked, with smooth, polished tannins and a fleshy mouthfeel. A feminine wine, it has great charm now, and should develop in the bottle for many years.",Rennie Reserve,95,100.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Flora Springs
131170,US,"A terrific Pinot Noir that's so delicious, you can't stop drinking it, and also shows a wonderful, classic coastal complexity. With tangy acidity and ultrarefined tannins, it gives the essence of wild raspberries and cherries. There's a feral quality to the fruit; you can detect notes of mountain eucalyptus, fennel and lavender. Oak adds the perfect touch of smoke. Just lovely, now and through 2014.",Pearlessence,95,40.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
131171,US,"An amazingly rich, complex and ageworthy wine. Made from 100% Cabernet grapes, it shows firm, plush flavors of blackberries and black currants, with a sour cherry candy tartness that's clean and piquant in the mouth. But the wine is also very tannic, giving a dry astringency through the finish. Should reward time in the cellar. Best 2012–2018.",Hillside Reserve,95,100.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Flora Springs
131172,US,"Piña has a spectacular record with this wine, and indeed with all their Cabs from Howell Mountain. The '07 is notable for its superb structure. It has pristine tannins and a good, dry mouthfeel, with very rich flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate and cedar that are grounded with notes of anise and sweet herbs. Very fine and dramatic, this 100% Cab should develop for at least the next eight years.",Buckeye Vineyard,95,85.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Piña
131173,France,"A beautifully ripe wine, layered with the richest fruit, the acidity offering a bright moment within the richness. Botrytis is there, like a hard core for the pillow of ripe apricots, lychees, spice and fine freshness.",,95,,Bordeaux,Sauternes,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Clos Haut-Peyraguey
131174,US,"A tremendous wine that easily merits being Barnett's most expensive release. Shows the ripe blackberry and black currant flavors and new oak that are so easily achieved, with yet near perfect tannins and a dryness unusual in a Cabernet this fruity. The combination of opposites makes this mountain wine noteworthy, as well as ageable. Now–2017.",Rattlesnake Hill Estate Bottled,95,125.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Barnett
131175,US,"All Maresh vineyard grapes are behind this gorgeous and feminine Pinot, with soft and evocative scents of truffle, chocolate and raspberry. Brilliant winemaking that takes all the elements of great Oregon fruit and puts them into unique focus, with winemaker Kelley Fox's trademark blend of biodynamic earthy/fungal flavors, elegant berry/cherry fruit, and just a touch of milk chocolate. The alcohol just reaches 13%.",Audrey,95,65.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Scott Paul
131176,US,"This is a very high-class Cabernet. You can tell from the sumptuous tannins and the overall balance and elegance. It's soft and gentle enough to drink now, with voluptuous waves of blackberries, black currants, anise, chocolate and cedar, yet shows a density that suggests midterm ageability through 2015 or so.",H.B. Vineyard,95,225.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Peju
131177,US,"The vineyard is in Oakville, and the wine, which is 100% Cabernet, shows classically firm tannins and Oakville's signature blackberries and black currants. Oak adds fleshy, smoky notes that are perfectly in keeping with the fruit. Very dry, this is a wine you want to cellar. Best after 2012, and will develop in a good cellar for many years afterward.",Holy Smoke Vineyard,94,85.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Flora Springs

131179,US,"Oregon has always made great Rieslings, yet few of the state's winemakers have ever made it a priority. Trisaetum's James Frey is out to change that, and is off to a great start. This 2008, like its predecessor, captures the complexity, grace and compelling charm of the grape. Dense and still light, it brings honey, tea, lemon, nectarine, jasmine, lime, caramel and sweet nut flavors together, a riotous jumble that is beyond delicious. But wait; it will improve with cellaring.",,94,24.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Riesling,Trisaetum
131180,US,"This Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend is very fine, and shows the classic structure of Rutherford. The tannins are rich and dusty, and there's a sour candy taste to the red and black cherries, enriched with smoky oak. With a long, richly spicy finish, it should easily negotiate the next 6–8 years in the cellar.",Estate Bottled Rutherford Red,94,80.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,William Harrison
131181,France,"Packed with botrytis, this is a wine whose sweetness is suppressed by richness.

This is a wine whose journey is just beginning.",,94,,Bordeaux,Sauternes,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Lafaurie-Peyraguey
131182,US,"Coniglio specializes in appellation-specific bottlings from Napa Valley. With this Cab, they have captured the essence of Diamond Mountain.

Rich and appealing, it should develop over the next decade.",,94,60.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Coniglio
131183,US,"Dense and intricately constructed, this Pinot Noir always is a big, rich fruity wine. The 2007 is perhaps emblematic of the vineyard, showing massive flavors of cherries, blueberries and wilder, foxier berries that have an exotic note. The tannins are thick, and the wine is entirely dry. Very fine, a chef's dream to pair with perfectly matched food. Fine now, with a few hours of decanting, and should develop through 2013, at least.",Klopp Ranch,94,57.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
131184,US,"This has a surprising amount of vanilla cream in the flavors, plus soft, seductive raspberry fruit. The fruit comes from the oldest part of the Maresh vineyard—38-year-old self-rooted vines. The wine is a pale rose, yet substantial in the style of a classic Pinot from Eyrie. After some hours breathing it opens up with elegant, seductive aromas and some caramel streaks, delicate and perfectly proportioned.",Maresh Vineyard,94,50.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Kelley Fox
131185,Spain,"Make room in the cellar for this heavyweight! Talk about a monster wine; but there's also finesse, character and style to it. Alabaster is the top wine from the Eguren family's new Toro winery, and it's big, tannic and loaded with spice, molasses and syrupy black fruit flavors. Rich, long and fierce on the finish, with tannins and heat to resolve. Best from 2012 through 2020.",Alabaster,94,250.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
131186,US,"A very good wine, rich and softly drinkable now, with voluptuous tannins. It's extraordinarily ripe in blackberries, black cherries, anise, chocolate, spices and cedar. Doesn't seem all that much better than the winery's regular '06 Cab, at less than half the price, but it's quite opulent and will develop for a decade.",Estate Bottled Reserve,94,105.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Peju
131187,US,"This is a restaurant wine. It's really fancy, really good and really food-friendly. Although it's rich in fruit and oak, it possesses an underlying tension, with acidity and tannins all vying for center stage. You're always looking for the center of gravity.

131188,US,"Pristine is the word that comes to mind. Also pure, transparent, lucid.

131189,US,"The top wine from Ken Wright in 2008, this beautifully elegant wine clocks in at just 13.3% alcohol, yet delivers a mouthful of delicious flavors.

131190,France,"Savennières is a new vineyard acquisition for Jo Pithon, with vines planted on 2.5 acres in 2000.

131191,Austria,"This 2003, with its hot year provenance, shows lush fruit, chocolate flavors, and a long, superrich spicy aftertaste. What it does miss is acidity, suggesting it is a wine that will age relatively fast. But for those who like denseness and power, this is one to go for.",Salzberg,89,88.0,Burgenland,,,Red Blend,Gernot and Heike Heinrich
131192,Austria,"The “more” is Cabernet Franc, added, according to Hans Feiler, “in just a tiny touch.” And, although the French wood caramel and vanilla flavors are powerful, there's just enough to catch the perfume of the Cab. But, with its dark fruits, this is much more about long-lived Zweigelt.",Zweigelt & More,89,36.0,Burgenland,,,Red Blend,Feiler-Artinger

131195,US,"Here's a pull out all the stops, bells and whistles Chard that aims to compete at a high level. Barrel fermented in 80% new oak, aged on the lees and put through full malolactic fermentation, it's rich, creamy, buttery and exotically flavored in opulent toasted barrel and tropical fruits.

131196,Argentina,"Full, dark and minty, with aromatic notes of coconut and ink. One look, sniff and sip tells you this is a dark, ripe wine with extract.

131201,US,"Another successful Pinot, similar to the '04— may be a bit crisper and more elegant, but with the same lovely cola, cherry, strawberry, root beer, dusty spice and vanilla-oak flavors. Probably offering its most exuberant side now and for a year or two.",Olivet Lane Vineyard,89,30.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pellegrini
131202,France,"By contrast with the Chenin Sec from Château de Fesle's La Chapelle vineyard, this is unoaked.

131203,France,"A freshly perfumed wine, with attractive bright cherry flavors that have a lift and crispness to them. The tannins are persistent and dry, layering with the plum skin acidity.

131207,US,"Not as rich and opulent as the great '02, the '03 nonetheless is elegant, showing true mountain character. It's dry and tannic, with blackberry, currant, plum and cherry flavors.

131208,France,"Round and full, what this lacks in minerality, it makes up for in richness, its white nectarine and peach flavors and New World fruitiness. For a Pouilly-Fumé it is big, but it's also likely to age quickly.",,88,20.0,Loire Valley,Pouilly-Fumé,,Sauvignon Blanc,Hubert Veneau
131209,US,"Beautiful young Zin, built along balanced, Napa Cab lines.

131211,US,"No winery has associated itself more with Petite Sirah than Foppiano. That understanding shows in this wine, which wrestles the variety's rustically wild nature into something resembling submission.

131214,Argentina,"At 15% alcohol and with a nose full of prune, blazing oak and simmering blackberry jam, this is not for the weak. In fact, it may not be for the strong, because while we like the wine's sun-baked, ultraripe personality, we also acknowledge that it's teetering on the brink and probably won't age for very long.",Reserve,88,23.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Andeluna

131220,Greece,"As with the previous year's bottling, this wine is shut down with tannins and toasty oak. Dark and polished, with flavors of black fruits, coffee and spice trying to emerge, the wine's nose gives it away as an ager, offering damp earth, later transforming to coffee, spice and rich, dark fruit.

131230,US,"The grapes seem like they were picked earlier than others, making for a lean-style Pinot Noir that's high in acids and minerality. It's almost austere, although maybe “restrained” is a better word. Dry and tannic, but with a deep core of cherry compote fruit, the wine needs a little time.

131231,Australia,"Ross Estate is only several years old, but winemaker Rod Chapman is a long-time veteran, and his North Ridge Shiraz is a knockout for the price. Dense aromas of fruitcake and spice ease out of the glass, while the flavors follow a similar trajectory—rich and a touch syrupy, with dried-fruit and spice notes that are distinctly Barossa.

131244,US,"Rodney Strong has vineyards across the county, from cool to warm, and winemaker Rick Sayre is a master blender. This is a terrific wine at this price. It's rich and opulent in blackberry, cassis, cocoa and sweet oak, with ripe tannins and a beautiful balance. At this enormous production level—nearly a quarter-million cases—this is a tremendous achievement.",,90,19.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
131245,US,"At four-plus years, the wine is hanging in there, maintaining fruit and freshness and picking up some aged, dried pineapple and peach character. It's an interesting wine, picking up textural complexities, but needs to be drunk soon.",Reserve,90,28.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Mosaic
131246,US,"Made in a tight young style that requires cellaring, the wine opens with a minty, cigarette ash and char aroma, then turns much sweeter in the mouth. Ripe cherries, blackberries, cola and sweet spicy oak flavors dominate, leading to a tannic finish.

131248,US,"The vineyard is on benches between Rutherford and St. Helena. The wine is immaculate Cabernet in the modern style, soft and rich in blackberries and cherries that are so ripe, they veer into melted chocolate.

131249,New Zealand,"Shows all the intensity you could want from a New Zealand Merlot (there's just 7% Cab Franc and 1% Cab Sauvignon in the blend), but seems to be in a bit of an awkward stage right now. Back in June it showed great finesse and elegance to go with its power, but tasted again in September it seems chunkier, with some rough edges of wood and alcohol poking out.

And the finish is complementary and offers some chocolate as an aftertaste. Drink now and over the next two years.",Gran Sangre de Toro,88,15.0,Catalonia,Catalunya,,Red Blend,Torres
131254,Spain,"Youthful and exuberant, with a generous blend of lead pencil, molasses and plum/berry aromas.

131263,Spain,"Darker and a touch more stewy than the winery's less pricey old-vines effort.

131275,US,"The Del Rio vineyard, in southern Oregon's Rogue Valley AVA, has pioneered the cultivation of Syrah in that part of the Northwest. As the vines acquire some age, they are coming into focus, and the rough tannins seem to be more in balance with the fruit. These wines are somewhat similar in style to the Syrahs from the Okanagan valley of Canada, and they offer an earthy mix of flavor that puts the fruit under earth, soy, coffee and smoke.

Pungently herbal, yet neither stemmy nor vegetal, this lights up the nose with penetrating, resinous scents.

131319,US,"The second release of this vineyard designate. This is several steps up from the generic reds that characterize the lineup. It's got more focus and stuffing, more density and texture, than anything else. There's an interesting mushroom component. The fruit is tight and tart, and the acids a bit flush. This is not a particularly elegant wine, but it hangs in there with extended flavors, finishing with toasted almonds.",Andrews Vineyard,88,20.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sagelands
131320,US,"There's a sweet herbal quality to this Zin, bringing to mind fresh green thyme, rosemary and lavender.

131321,US,"This completes the 2005 Syrah quartet for Waters Syrahs. Very well made, both soft upon entry and substantial in midpalate, this mixes berries and cassis, accented with bourbon barrel, coffee grounds and smoke. If there is a complaint, it's that it's been pushed to 14.6% alcohol, and suffers somewhat as a result from a hot finish.",Pepper Bridge Vineyard,88,40.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Waters

131323,US,"With peach, citrus and flower flavors and a dry, creamy texture, this has the richness of an oaky Chardonnay and the acidity of Pinot Grigio.

131324,US,"Made in a nice, light style, this is Demetria's least costly of the three latest Pinots, but it's also the most charming, with appealing cherry, cola and spice flavors.",Jours de Bonheur,87,35.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Demetria
131325,Australia,"Inspired by a trip to Tuscany, Hamilton planted Sangiovese in the mid-1990s, and while this wouldn't be mistaken for Chianti, it does have Sangiovese's classic cherry and tobacco flavors. It's less full-bodied than the other Hamilton offerings, making it more of a picnic red, or one to pair with chicken rather than steak. Multiple U.S. importers.",The Mongrel,87,20.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Sangiovese,Hugh Hamilton
131326,Italy,"A smoky, dusty mineral quality sets the tone for this elegantly polished Pinot Nero that, ultimately, delivers high intensity thanks to its assorted aromas of blue flowers, cola and rose tea.

131328,US,"Mixed into the blend are smallish proportions of Muscat, Pinot Grigio, Riesling and Gewürztraminer, and this is not really trying to be Chardonnay.

131329,US,"This is what Valley of the Moon does so well—make a varietally true wine with some complexity, and offer it at a mid-priced range.

131330,New Zealand,"A good warning against holding Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc too long. This wine is already losing some fruit, showing a touch of asparagus or green bean. It's still impressively complex and weighty, with a rich, slightly oily mouthfeel, but deserved to be tasted earlier in its life.",Clifford Bay Reserve,87,31.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Villa Maria
131331,US,"From organically grown grapes, this off-dry Gewurztraminer shows a nice mix of orange blossom and varietal spice.

131334,Argentina,"A little more complexity than normal, as the nose offers dry spices like nutmeg and cinnamon. The palate deals your typical mix of cassis and black cherry, while the structure is defined by balanced tannins. A little weak in the middle and short on the finish, but at this price that's being picky.",Maipu Vineyards,87,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pascual Toso
131335,US,"Soft and lush, the flavors are just delicious, ranging from cherries and cassis to cola, cocoa, gingersnap cookie, rose petal tea and Asian spices. With every sip, you find something new.

131339,US,"There's a touch of raisiny overripeness in this dry Syrah, not a lot, but just enough to confuse the palate. Other than that, the wine is as smooth as can be, with a chocolate and bitter cherry finish.",,87,22.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,Burgess
131340,Argentina,"About five years into its existence and Colomé has found its groove in this excellent, luscious Malbec-Cabernet blend.

131342,Argentina,"Inky dark and an outstanding example of high-end Malbec. This is the finest Alta we've tried; it is ripe as can be but not raisiny.

131344,US,"It's nice that they've held back this wine for a few years before releasing it, because it's beginning to meld together in a very delightful way.

131457,US,"Kudos to Azalea Springs for bottling this with a screwtop. The vineyard is between St. Helena and Calistoga, at the foot of Diamond Mountain.

131462,US,"A brilliant dessert wine. It costs a lot of money to pick a wine like this, which is carefully selected on an almost cluster-by-cluster basis, but the results speak for themselves.

131464,US,"Despite a burst of tannins and acidity that make this wine somewhat aggressive, it's absolutely delicious, and should reward 3–5 years in the cellar.

131465,US,"This is one of the most tannic Cabs Far Niente has produced in quite a while. It's really not drinkable now, despite very complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, licorice, tobacco and plums, along with plenty of smoky new oak. Made with a few drops of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, which add perfume and flowers, it's a wine that won't come into its own for quite a while. Hold until 2013, at least, and it should provide interesting drinking for years after, in a proper cellar.",Estate Bottled,93,115.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Far Niente
131466,Spain,"A touch doughy on the nose, with prune and blackberry aromas that are neither pushy nor aggressive.

131467,US,"Quite a fine wine, although like Flora Springs' other '07 Cabs, it needs time in the cellar to come around. Grown in the Pope Valley section of eastern Napa, it shows ripe, flashy flavors of blackberries, cherries and chocolate, but those tannins are tough and hard.

131468,US,"Disconnected in its youth, with separate oak and fruit elements that need time to find each other and marry.

131472,US,"From the steep Sonoma slopes of Mount St. Helena comes this tannic, concentrated young 100% Cabernet.

131473,US,"This is a Zin for the cellar. It's fine now in rich fruit, but fairly tannic, and there's some tension of parts that 3–4 years should resolve.

131474,US,"An extraordinarily rich, tannic and dry wine, which despite its big structure is relieved by potent flavors of cherries, blackberries, plums and cedar, with savory touches of anise, sage and black pepper.

131475,US,"Here's a big, thick, ripe Pinot Noir. It's not clearly a whole lot better than Morgan's regular Double L Pinot, which costs far less. But it is more powerful in the intensity of blackberries and cherries, as well as oak. If power in California Pinot Noir is your thing, go for it. Should age well for up to eight years.",Hat Trick Double L Vineyard,93,85.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Morgan
131476,US,"Very fine and high-toned, a Cabernet that shows real class and pedigree.

Should age well through 2015.",Reserve,93,56.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Summers
131477,New Zealand,"Simply put, this is one of New Zealand's flagship reds, and it is a shame it is no longer being imported to the U.S. Lifted hints of dried flowers and herbs impart great complexity to the aromas, and the wine's cassis, cedar and chocolate flavors come across as intense without being overbearing. This is firmly structured, with plentiful but fine tannins. Drink 2015–2025.",Coleraine,93,,Hawke's Bay,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Te Mata
131478,US,"Easily the best Merlot in memory from Lake County, this one stands next to anything from Napa Valley, which is just over the hill from the vineyard.

131479,US,"Tastes and feels like all the parts are very good. The tannins are polished, the fruit is ripe and complex, the oak is elaborate, and there's a nice bite of acidity in the background. The blackberry, black currant, carob and cedar flavors are enticing and dry. But this wine is too young. It has a youthful rudeness that demands 5–7 years in the cellar. The score reflects potential.",The Philanthropist Yountville Estate Vineyard,93,52.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Markham
131480,US,"Longplay's 2008 reserve is quite different from its non-¬reserve stablemate. The aromas include more earthy barnyard scents, the color has a hint of maturity, and no new oak was used. As a result, this wine could pass for one with a few more years under its belt; its flavors more suggestive of fruit pastry, figs and plums, leather and compost. Complex and detailed, it's a lovely effort.",Jory Bench Reserve Lia's Vineyard,93,30.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Longplay
131481,US,"Delicious and appealing, a palate-flattering wine that offers a gorgeous structure.

131483,Spain,"Outstanding Sherry with complexity, richness and character. The nose has a salinic zest to it, making it no wallflower, and of course there's raisin and prune. The palate is formed, sculpted and balanced, with peanut M&M;'s candy, roasted fruit, chocolate ice cream and more. A beauty with power and poise.",Matusalem Oloroso Dulce Viejo,93,45.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,González Byass
131484,US,"Beautifully soft and limpid. So pretty and polished now, with ultrafine tannins framing ripe, dry flavors of black and red cherries, currants, chocolate, herbs and smoky sandalwood.

131485,US,"When Petite Sirah is at its best, and this one is, it offers incomparable structure and flavors. Nothing quite like it anywhere, with its inky dark color, big, thick tannins and ripe, exuberant flavors of berries, currants, mocha, leather, tobacco, cedar and peppery spices. What's especially nice about this bottling is the dryness and moderate alcohol. A superior wine that should age for the better part of a decade.",,93,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Petite Sirah,Summers
131486,US,"Four vineyards – Ribbon Ridge, Momtazi, Maresh and Shea – are included here. Soft and seductive, this wine caresses the palate with silky fruit. Aromatically it weaves together red fruits, truffles and clean, earthy scents. It reaches just over 13% alcohol; truly Burgundian yet with an Oregon flair to the fruit flavors. It puts the lie to any notion that this was a poor vintage. Challenging to be sure, but great wines were made in 2007, and this is one of them.",La Paulée,93,30.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Scott Paul
131487,Spain,"This is the tier-two wine from the Egurens' new Toro project, and it's stellar. Intense aromas of black fruit, char and mint start it out, and next up come cola, roasted black fruit, clove and cured-meat flavors. Oak is forward now, but it should settle in a year or so. A dynamite Toro to drink from 2011 through 2018.",Victorino,93,71.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
131488,US,"Dominique Lafon consults on these wines, sourced from a vineyard now almost 30 years old.  Evening Land is among the wineries who sense an opportunity to make refined, elegant wines from the terroir of this little-known region. Lovely aromas, complex scents and flavors, pine and herb, cranberry and raspberry, earth and seafoam—lots of nuances here.",Seven Springs Vineyard La Source,93,67.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Evening Land
131489,Spain,"A wonderfully balanced and giving wine with sweet raisin and prune aromas and an overall richness akin to crude oil. Flavors of baked black plum, brown sugar and molasses are both juicy and rich, and then toffee and mocha take over on the finish. Sweet and thick for sure, but with discernible fruit and vitality.",Noe Viejo,93,45.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Pedro Ximénez,González Byass
131490,US,"How tasty this fresh wine is. It's all about cherries and raspberries, with overtones of chocolate, vanilla, sweet licorice and pepper. Yet the wine is thoroughly dry, and balanced with rich acidity. It's not only delicious, it's complex. Contains a little Malbec, which brings body.",,90,16.0,California,El Dorado,Sierra Foothills,Grenache,David Girard
131491,Spain,"Spice, herbs, smoked meat and a dark core work in harmony on the bouquet. The palate on this well-made Reserva packs black cherry, cassis and plum, and that's followed by a stylish, smooth finish that comes on buttery at first and then settles in. Doesn't overwhelm but complements food nicely. Tasted twice.",Reserva,90,40.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Conde de la Salceda
131492,Spain,"Very colorful and properly ripe, with lush berry aromas backed by coffee notes. The palate is lush and balanced, with deep blueberry, black cherry and cola notes. A truly committed wine with a smooth, unctuous finish as the final chapter.",,90,15.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Syrah,Alceño
131493,Argentina,"A lovely, crisp-styled Malbec (with 10% Merlot) that does the Río Negro region of Patagonia proud. A Lisa is in its inaugural vintage, and the wine boasts toast, mineral and black fruit both on the nose and in the mouth. Not exactly streamlined but tighter than most Malbecs. Drink now into 2008.",A Lisa,90,24.0,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Malbec,Bodega Noemía de Patagonia
131494,US,"Smells and tastes sharp, but this acidity is expressed in sweet peppermint and wintergreen that adds a piquant, tart touch to the cherry and cocoa flavors. This is a really lovely Pinot, velvety, elegant and balanced, a wine that some other producers would charge far more for.",,90,18.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,La Rochelle
131495,France,"A nice straw/pale yellow color, the nose on this wine is subdued, with hints of grain, lime and slate, but the palate perks up with plenty of citrus flavor leaning toward lime. Balanced, with a smooth feel and tiny bubbles, this delicious sparkler will instigate caviar dreams.",Brut,90,18.0,Burgundy,Crémant de Bourgogne,,Sparkling Blend,Léonce Bocquet
131496,US,"Owner/winemaker Oded Shakked was until recently the longtime winemaker at J Wine Co.

Drink now.",Dakine Vineyard,90,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Longboard
131497,Australia,"There's no doubting the quality of this wine, which exudes class and refinement. It's not as plush as some other Aussie Grenaches, but deftly marries kirsch, vanilla and dried spices into an integrated and complex whole. Firm on the finish, with a bit of a tart edge.",Aerope,90,102.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Grenache,Two Hands
131498,US,"The best thing about this wine is the acid-tannin balance. Sure, it's ripe in blackberry and blueberry jam and cocoa flavors, but so are plenty of other red wines. But it has a cool-climate structure that makes it impressive. The Sangiovese in this blend with Cabernet Sauvignon lends a peppery, meaty note.",Due Amici,90,28.0,California,Arroyo Seco,Central Coast,Red Blend,Ventana
131499,US,"A very good Cab, a little young and in need of cellaring, but such is the fruit that you can drink it now. It's plush in black currant, crème de cassis and new oaky flavors wrapped in soft, velvety tannins, with a chocolaty, licorice finish. Should hold for a good ten years.",Leonardini Vineyard,90,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Whitehall Lane
131500,Spain,"Starts with roasted, leathery aromas that feature hints of burnt beef and berry compote.

131501,US,"I like this Merlot for its full-bodied richness and depth of flavor. It's so much better than the '02.

131502,US,"Wonderful Merlot, rich and complex, with the classy mouthfeel that Napa provides so effortlessly.

131503,Australia,"Another top-flight Dead Arm, the 2003 boasts attractive scents of leather, spice, vanilla and boysenberries. The palate is lush and creamy, carrying earthy dark-fruited flavors enlivened by a bright streak of acidity. Turns chewy on the finish, suggesting short-term cellaring is in order. Try after 2008.",The Dead Arm,90,65.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,D'Arenberg
131504,US,"What a complex, delicious wine this is. A blend of five Rhône varieties, mainly Roussanne, it has the richness and mouthfeel of a barrel-fermented Chardonnay, but a very different taste.

131506,US,"Almost dessert in a glass, so rich and chocolaty, with such powerful baked blackberry and cherry pie flavors, and a gooey, honeyed softness. Just look at those glycerine stains.

131507,US,"Last year's bottling was a hard act to follow, but Mauritson's done it again. The vintage was cooler and this wine seems crisper and zestier but no less flavorful, bursting at the seams with ripe lemon, lime, peach and wildflower flavors. Turns as rich as honey on the finish, but it's a dry wine.",,90,16.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Mauritson
131508,US,"Starts off very oaky, with masses of sweet buttery char, crème brûlée and vanilla notes. What's under all that? Delicious blackberry pie filling and polished cherry cola.

131509,US,"If you know those Argentine Malbecs, you know what you're in for. This is a dark, huge, tannic, explosive red wine, with massive blackberry and cherry, cocoa and sweet leather flavors. It's perfectly dry, but quite a bit softer than those from Argentina. Drink now with barbecued steak.",,90,25.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Malbec,Mosaic
131510,US,"With a lighter structure than Cabernet Sauvignon and flavors veering toward cherries rather than black currants, this fine wine is deliciously drinkable now.

131511,Australia,"Inky purple-black in color, this looks like a heavyweight, and lovers of big, rich wines likely won't be disappointed. It's full-bodied, verging on heavy, with chocolaty plum and prune flavors that nevertheless stay surprisingly fresh on the long finish. It's approachable now, but how long it will last is a tough call.",RWT,90,75.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Penfolds
131512,US,"Drinks very soft and forward and is accessible now, with plenty of upfront cherry pie filling, blackberry jam, cocoa and cola flavors.

131513,US,"Napa brings classic elegance, Amador a lusty exuberance, to this very fine Zinfandel.

131514,Italy,"Because this sparkler goes through secondary fermentation in the bottle (metodo tradizionale) you can count on rich, saturated tones of honey, apple pie, roasted nuts and cookie dough.

131516,US,"The vineyard is in the southern part of the valley, near Carneros, and the wine shows fog-influenced acidity that cleans and refreshes the exotic fruit, flower, mineral and spice flavors.

131517,US,"There aren't lots of Cabs coming off this mountain but it's a pretty good guarantee of quality. This is a tannic young wine, rather dry and astringent now, but it has a huge core of molten cherry and blackberry fruit, with enough balance for the long haul.

131518,US,"Beautiful Zin, lush and decadent and heady. Hits you with the most wonderfully ripe chocolate, blackberry and cherry marmalade, licorice and spice flavors that are so rich, they would be gooey without the balancing acids and tannins.

131519,US,"This is a great price for a dessert wine of this deliciousness. It's all apricot jam, honeysuckle and vanilla spice, and tastes botrytisy too, with a richly honeyed mouthfeel.

131521,Argentina,"Smooth and consistent Malbec from Cafayate is what Michel Torino is all about. Don David is a higher-aiming effort, and while it shows a touch of northern Argentina's herbal, sun-affected characteristics, it's also a well-balanced, formulaic Malbec that hits all the markers: good color, nice body, friendly tannins and plenty of oak.",Don David Reserve,88,15.0,Other,Cafayate,,Malbec,Michel Torino
131522,Austria,"Light and fresh, this relies on its clean lines, even with that slightly funky edge of Pinot Noir. It has its pure red fruit flavors and acidity; the tannins suggest structure, offering some firm, food-friendly tastes.",,88,41.0,Niederösterreich,,,Pinot Noir,Zull
131523,Argentina,"Pronounced oak is the opening blast, and amid the shy red berry and tomato leaf aromas there are hints of leather, mint and coconut. All these scents indicate that heavy wood was thrown at the wine, so while the power and goals of the wine are admirable, it's weighed down presently by a touch too much resin. Maybe that'll drift with time but that's not for sure.",Selección de Bodega Single Vineyard,88,35.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Doña Paula

131525,Argentina,"A good finisher, with early minty, resiny aromas giving way to broader, more typical ripe aromas and flavors. The mouthfeel is lively courtesy of vivid core acidity, while the berry and cherry flavors come across ripe and grabby. The more air you give it the better it'll perform.

131527,US,"They kept the alcohol nice and low, only 12.7%, resulting in a light-bodied, Sancerre-style wine of delicacy and finesse.

131528,US,"One of the richest Zins on the market now. Enormous in blackberry, cherry, raspberry, blueberry and every other kind of berry flavors, with a coating of melted milk chocolate, sweet red licorice and Fig Newton.

131531,Italy,"Located at the foot of the town of San Giorgio in western Valpolicella, Boscaini's top cru seems to have been affected by the hot vintage.

131532,Argentina,"Soft, easy and totally ripe, this easygoing blend of Cabernet and Merlot should win over most consumers because it's a friendly sort that's endowed with cola, plum and abundant richness.

131537,Italy,This producer fought against Mother Nature and the wet 2002 vintage with 36 months of barrique aging.

131538,US,"Nice and lush. The flavors of cherry, cassis, anise, milk chocolate and cinnamon spice are just delicious, and there's a good texture, too.

Shows the promise of this mountainous Lake County appellation.",,88,25.0,California,Red Hills Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Syrah,Vin Nostro
131561,US,"Here's a bright, exotically fruity Chard that satisfies all around for its lime, kiwi, butterscotch, fig, honey and toast flavors and brisk, cleansing acidity. Drink this yummy wine now.",Edna Ranch,88,17.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Vina Robles
131562,Italy,"Here's one of those edgy, sassy Italian whites that pairs so magically with pasta or simple seafood. A crisp, lean texture aids in its ability to wash the palate clean but the wine also has just enough creaminess and staying power not to be overwhelmed by the food served with it.",Stellato,88,24.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Vermentino di Sardegna,,Vermentino,Pala
131563,Australia,"From a higher elevation—and hence cooler—region of Australia, this is a light to medium-bodied Cabernet that avoids excessive leanness, offering up a mélange of plump cassis, leather and tobacco. It's not the most powerful Cab, but offers elegance and length at an affordable price.",,88,13.0,New South Wales,Southern Highlands,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cuttaway Hill Estate
131564,Australia,"Conventional wisdom is that 2004 was a better Margaret River vintage than 2003, but this wine suffers a bit in comparison to its older sibling. Thankfully, it's still very good, with plentiful cassis and red plum fruit, soft tannins and crisp acids.",The Reserve,88,30.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Evans & Tate
131565,Italy,"Scirafi is less intense in terms of the immediacy of its aromas, but the wine does come alive in the mouth. Flavors of apricot, raison, dried fig, almond and honey are enjoyable and long-lasting.",Scirafi,88,26.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Passito di Pantelleria,,Zibibbo,Abraxas
131566,US,"This is a light but classy take on Oregon Pinot, with leaf and herb in front of spicy cranberry and sour cherry fruit. The balance is fine-tuned and the wine carries the elegance of the grape through a persistent finish.",Oregon,88,35.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,I'M
131567,US,"Hall made its reputation with Rutherford Cabs grown in the Sacrashe vineyard. This valley-wide Cab was made from grapes from all over the valley, Atlas Peak and Oak Knoll to St. Helena. The wine is very good, with ripe, modern-style cherry, cassis and oak flavors and ripe tannins, but it lacks the elegant complexity of the Sacrashe bottling. Best now and through 2010.",,88,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kathryn Hall Vineyards
131568,Australia,"Katnook's introductory tier of wines includes this dense, superripe Cabernet Sauvignon. Hints of smoke, spice and dried herbs on the nose give way to almost pruny fruit and deep chocolate flavors. Tannins are creamy-soft, making it approachable in its youth.",Founder's Block,88,25.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Katnook Estate
131569,US,"“Nu” seems to be Kunde's way of letting us know that this is an unoaked Chardonnay. It shows pure, untrammelled Chard flavors of green apples, peaches, pears, kiwis and limes. It's also a very crisp wine, as it did not undergo the malolactic fermentation.",Chardonnay Nu,88,18.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kunde
131570,Australia,"This Cabernet fits the steakhouse red formula to a T. Ripe, lusty fruit—blackberry in this case—is matched by a big whack of vanillin oak.

131571,Australia,"Clean, correct and undoubtedly well crafted, this blend of 82% Cabernet and 18% Merlot features aromas of cassis, graham crackers and mint, then adds hints of vanilla and chocolate on the palate. It's a friendly, balanced style that should have broad appeal. Drink now–2015.",,88,19.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Wildberry Estate
131572,US,"This is a very nice bottle of Pinot, with sweet flavors of strawberry preserves. Spice and jam-packed, it's all about the fruit, ripe and round and delicious. The 18 months in French oak have not overloaded it with toast or vanilla; just a dash of sweet barrel flavor.",Signature Cuvée,88,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley Vineyards
131573,Australia,"A real crowd-pleaser, the 2005 Shingleback may not have quite the complexity of the 2004, but it's still a fun, approachable wine. Cola and coffee notes accent plum and blackberry flavors, while the broad texture coats the mouth with soft tannins. Drink now–2012.",,88,22.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Shingleback
131574,Spain,"Heavily oaked and loaded down with butter and resin, this is a wine for those infatuated with the obscure. The blend is 90% Callet and 10% Fogoneu, and don't ask us to give you the history of these Mallorcan grapes. Suffice it to say that this wine is broad, a bit stewy and very different. It's not heavy like an anchor but it has its chunky shoulder pads to deal with. Only 25 cases made.",Son Negre,88,110.0,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,,Red Blend,Ànima Negra
131575,US,"Does just what you want a Cab at this price to do, offering soft, immediate pleasure with extra points for complex elegance.

131576,US,"Phelps is, of course, a red wine house, but they do a credible job with Sauvignon Blanc.

131577,US,"This Pinot overcomes a somewhat murky appearance by offering an interesting mix of earth, tomato leaf, pepper and granite, along with very tart red fruits. It's textural and chewy, with substantial tannins, but it's also flavorful and dense, and for the relatively modest price it shows some real muscle.",Cali's Cuvée,88,24.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Left Coast Cellars

131579,Argentina,"Fairly smoky at first, with background aromas of varietally appropriate game, leather and animal.

A good wine with pure dark fruit flavors.",,88,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Chakana

131582,US,"What a terrific Merlot. Cool Carneros is a natural home to the variety, and this wine is so ripe in blackberry, cherry, coffee and leather flavors, and so dry and balanced. The tannins are pure and supple. All in all, it's just a tremendously rewarding red wine.",Heritage Reserve,92,30.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Merlot,Schug
131583,New Zealand,"This is a full-bodied, lush, creamy Chardonnay, but it has something extra to recommend it—a long, mouthwatering finish. The aromas are toasty, but the oak is well integrated and softly frames rich melon, peach and citrus flavors, while secondary accents of butter-toasted nuts and vanilla add layers of complexity.",Reserve,91,46.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Chardonnay,Clearview
131584,France,"While the Amour de Deutz, the other blanc de blancs from Deutz is very much in the apéritif style, this blanc de blancs is more of a food wine. It has structure, lemon zest, peaches and other white fruits and a touch of honey. Already somewhat evolved, but still fresh.",Blanc de Blancs Brut,91,94.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Deutz
131585,US,"Racy acidity characterizes this ripely fruity, oaky wine. It's strong in pineapple, apricot and tangerine cream flavors, while plenty of new French oak contributes a spicy, vanilla-infused smokiness. A bit obvious, but certainly a delicious, captivating Chardonnay.",Barrel Select,91,38.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Foley
131586,US,"Ripe, rich and silky, with black cherry, cranberry, cola, leather, cocoa, heirloom tomato, balsamic and spice flavors, this is a heck of a good Pinot. It's dry and balanced, a fine showcase of its celebrated terroir. The juicy acidity is a bit raw, but the wine should mellow by 2007.",Rancho Santa Rosa,91,38.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Foley
131587,Portugal,"In a recent series of entry-level Madeiras, this was a standout, offering excellent complexity and richness at a reasonable price. Nuts, toffee and dried fruit aromas and flavors swirl together, balancing moderate sweetness with harmonious acids. Long on the finish.",5 Year,91,21.0,Madeira,,,Sercial,Blandy's
131588,South Africa,"An opulently rich wine from very ripe fruit giving soft tannins, a delicious layer of red berries and mature Cab flavors.

131589,US,"Give credit both to the terroir and Quivira's long experience, for this is a beautiful Zinfandel.

131590,US,"The vineyard, in a warmer part of the valley, is old, but the wine has intense, youthfully jammy flavors of raspberries, cherries and blueberries, with Zin's great edge of peppery spice. It's a big, audacious wine, but never loses poise despite very high alcohol.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,91,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
131591,US,"Rhône specialist Dennis Fife turns to a vineyard between St. Helena and Calistoga for this Syrah, and the warm vintage has yielded a ripe wine. But Fife has complete control, keeping the rich cherry-chocolate flavors while maintaining a balance of acidity, tannins and dryness.",Max Vineyard,91,32.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,Fife
131592,US,"This is the most balanced and enjoyable of Fife's current crop of Zins, a wholesome, complete wine that captures Zin's wild side and tames it.

131593,US,"This is a fine, dry wine that proves how amenable the region's cool climate is for making great Syrah. The fruit is lush, filling the mouth with raspberry, cherry, mocha and vanilla flavors, with a cedary, leathery complexity. Notable for the smooth, supple tannins.",Dixon Ranch Vineyard,91,24.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Cerro Caliente
131594,US,"Very good Syrah, with tight, astringently young tannins courtesy of the region's cool climate.

Excellent value for the price.",SRH,91,18.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Syrah,Lafond
131595,US,"Big, rich, ripe, mouthfilling—there's nothing subtle about this Pinot. It's huge in cherry pie, cola, pomegranate, rhubarb pie, cocoa and sweet, smoky oak flavors. Backing them up is superb acidity and a dry, racy minerality. This succulent young Pinot should age well for the next five years.",Edna Ranch,91,28.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Tolosa
131596,New Zealand,"From a top vintage in the region, this is the sort of wine that has won such acclaim for Central Otago. Deep, dark color, bold aromatics and a full, lush feel on the palate imbue this wine with the complete package. Black cherries predominate, but there's also a spicy, wild, briary note on the finish. Drink now-2010.",,91,,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Quartz Reef
131597,France,"This is the first vintage of a cuvée named, so the advertising has it, after a figure who is both romantic and modern. It is certainly a fine blend that shows ripe fruit, some layers of toast to go with some honey and fresh white fruits. It should age, but, as an apéritif wine, it's ready to drink now.",Cuvée Allegra,91,65.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Jacquart
131598,South Africa,"A classic Bordeaux blend, dominated by 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, Premiere Selection is a ripe wine, layered with sweet fruit dominating firm tannins.

131600,New Zealand,"A distinctly different style of Sauvignon Blanc than that found in Marlborough, this is riper and rounder, with more potential for evolution in the bottle. Notes of citrus custard mark the bouquet, while the flavors veer toward melon and fig, with hints of peach or nectarine. It's velvety textured, and long on the finish.",,91,20.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Te Awa
131601,France,"This is a delicate style of wine, very classic Pommery. But it does have delicious, crisp fruit, apples and cream flavors. It is still young, very fresh and green—needs more time in the bottle.",Louise,91,180.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Pommery
131602,France,"Unusual in the Philipponnat range (normally dominated by Pinot Noir), this blanc de blancs is a blend of Chardonnays from the Côte des Blancs and from the Montagne de Reims.

131603,Spain,"An old-school wine done really well. It starts with cherry, tobacco and light coconut aromas before moving on to juicy boysenberry and citrus flavors that are boosted by CUNE's trademark acids. Muscular, wiry and structured, but with restraints. Think Barry Bonds before Balco.",Imperial Reserva,91,45.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
131604,Argentina,"One of the year's best red wine values has to be this fully ripe and totally structured Malbec made by Alberto Antonini (winemaker for Altos Las Hormigas) and Hector Durigutti. The color almost gives away its power; and if not, the aromas of marinated meat, plum and blackberry essence will. Saturated, thick and modern, but made right. Perfect with beef.",Punto Final,91,11.0,Mendoza Province,Perdriel,,Malbec,Bodega Renacer
131605,South Africa,"A classic Bordeaux blend, featuring 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Franc. It is packed with great cassis flavors that mesh well with the coffee and mocha flavors, dry tannins and hints of spice from 24 months in new wood.

131606,US,"Showing fine varietal character in the racy, silky mouthfeel, high acidity and wonderful dryness, this Pinot brims with cool-climate cola, tart red cherry and cranberry flavors that are so ripe, they finish almost chocolate like.

131607,New Zealand,"Made from young vines in the Awatere Valley, this lovely Sauvignon features a bit of smoky pungency on the nose, then honeyed citrus and stone fruit flavors before turning minerally and taut on the finish. Drink now. Not imported.",,91,,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Foxes Island
131608,Portugal,"Mildly syrupy in texture, this is an intensely sweet Madeira balanced by racy acidity.

131612,Italy,"Italy's first cru Verdicchio, Le Moie offers loads of citrus-and lime-like nuances on the heels of stone fruit, field flowers and fruit candy.

131614,US,"Arrowood's Saralee's always is balanced and dry, but quality varies by vintage. The '03 is a very good wine, rich in licorice-accented cassis and pepper flavors, with a generous coating of smoky oak. It's not a big wine, or ageable, but it does have grace and elegance now and for a year or two.",Saralee's Vineyard,87,40.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Arrowood
131615,US,"This is a waxy, rather soft rendition of Sauvignon Blanc, and the pretty fruit flavors mix grapefruit, citrus and pineapple. There is very little suggestion of Sauvignon Blanc's herbal or grassy side; the grapes seem to have been ripened past that point, though not all the way to California-style, tropical fruit flavors. All in all this is a well-crafted, smooth and flavorful wine, with a portion barrel-aged for extra complexity.",Grand Estates,87,11.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Columbia Crest

131617,Italy,"There's a unique quality to Bressan whites that almost always gives them away. You could describe it as sappy pine nut or chestnut honey and this Verduzzo is a prime example of what I mean. Make no mistake, this is a sophisticated and evolved wine with excellent length and deep golden saturation. But it's also an acquired taste.",,87,30.0,Northeastern Italy,Venezia Giulia,,Verduzzo,Bressan

131621,US,"Not a shy wine, but quite lively on the palate, loaded with high-toned fruits and bright acids. This is an interesting flavor mix, not jammy despite the high alcohol. The mainly red fruits are a bit jumbled together, and hints of leaf and fresh herb are scattered throughout. It's interesting and complex; a little on the green side.",Twilight Hills Red,87,30.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Red Blend,Merry Cellars
131622,France,"Putting aside the chic lipstick pink bottle (and the pink plastic box it comes in), this is a pleasing, soft wine, with white fruit flavors which lend crisp point to the easy palate. It is certainly dry, but it is also relatively soft, a well thought out blend.",Pop Rosé Extra Dry,87,50.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Pommery
131623,US,"Scents of stone and anise lead into pretty floral notes. Clean and racy, this comes across with a pleasing minerality. There's a good leesy texture to the midpalate. The only quibble is that it turns a little bit soft and soapy as it hits the finish.",Dry,87,16.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Riesling,Steppe Cellars
131624,US,"From Clifton and Coyote Canyon vines, this tastes of quinine, lime and citrus; it's sharp, fragrant and quite young. The finish falls off into hot, acidic, slightly bitter phenolics, but improves as it breathes. It's one of those gin and tonic-style Viogniers that pack plenty of flavor but turn a little harsh at the end.",,87,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Viognier,Syncline
131625,US,"Although this is pretty tannic, with a sandpapery grip that finishes with astringency, it's fancy and layered. Waves of blackberries, cassis, coffee, cherries, leather and pepper-cinnamon spices wash over the palate, leaving the impression of importance. Still, it's not an ager. Best now and for a couple of years.",,87,30.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Wild Oak by St. Francis
131626,US,"This is just a little too soft, sweet and ripe, although it retains the classic structure and elegance you demand from the venerable name Eisele. The flavor of sugared crushed blackberries, cherries and caramelly vanilla suggest drinking now.",Family Estate,87,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Volker Eisele Family Estate
131627,US,"The blend includes 5% Viognier, an interesting choice that brings in floral scents and provides counterweight to the ramped up oaky seasonings. It's a curious mix that doesn't quite knit together, but makes for a more complex wine than you would expect. There's some sweet spice in the finish.",,87,11.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Snoqualmie
131628,US,"Does a nice job of balancing Viognier's exotic personality with the demands of elegance. The flavors are all here, peaches, pears, pineapples, honey and vanilla, among others.

131629,Italy,"Here is a luminous, golden-hued Grigio with opulent notes of honey, savory apricot and apple-nut.

131631,Italy,"One of the most attractive aspects of this fresh white blend is its structure: The wine is silky and smooth and seemingly weightless at the same time.

Try it with grilled shrimp in a cilantro pesto sauce.",Cà del Magro,87,16.0,Veneto,Custoza Superiore,,White Blend,Monte del Frá
131632,US,"Not quite on a par with the '01 or '02, this is more like the 2000 Marinus.

Elegant, but not an ager; drink now.",Marinus,87,40.0,California,Carmel Valley,Central Coast,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Bernardus
131633,France,"In a young, fresh style, this is full of white fruits, crisp acidity and pink grapefruit with a sugar touch. The aftertaste, though, is relatively soft, but still in balance with the rest of the flavors.",Tsarine Premier Cru Brut,87,46.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Chanoine

131635,US,"The wine is almost honey-colored, and scented with sweet hay and clover. That impression of sweet grass carries over into the mouth, and it adds life and lift to the rather rich and heavy fruit. Don't look for it to improve or to age beyond a year or two. The blend includes 7% Sauvignon Blanc.",,87,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sémillon,Covington

131638,Australia,"Only the third vintage of Tempranillo for Hamilton, it's rather crisp and firm, with fresh blackberry fruit framed by vanilla and tobacco.

131643,Germany,"This youthful auslese is still showing a lot of postfermentation estery characters: it's very perfumed and floral, with such tropical notes as banana and pineapple.

131728,Spain,"Honey and corn syrup aromas tell you this is rich, but what you don't realize so easily is how complex and expansive this Muscat is. The flavors of honey, banana and clover start out as sweet and unctuous, but then they unfurl to show depth, complexity and length.

131804,Australia,"The 2003 Billi Billi Shiraz features slightly medicinal flavors of cherries and rhubarb accented by scorched chocolate notes and a hint of eucalyptus. The texture is creamy-smooth, while the finish lingers elegantly. It's a pleasant counterpoint to some of the heavyweight Shirazes from South Australia, at a bargain price.",Billi Billi,90,15.0,Victoria,Victoria,,Shiraz,Mount Langi Ghiran
131805,US,"Here's a plush, supple Cab, rich in cassis, cherry, coffee, herb and spice flavors that are wrapped in lush, sweetly ripe tannins. It's a very dry wine, and balanced enough to benefit from mid-term aging. Hold until 2007, then best through 2011 or so.",,89,30.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau Chevalier
131806,US,"Cathy Corison brings her deft touch to this blend from various Napa vineyards. It's a soft, comforting wine, classic Napa Cab, with black currant and smoky oak flavors edging into chocolate. It's opulent and proper rather than exciting.",,89,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Corison
131807,New Zealand,"This winery seems to be at the top of its game in recent vintages, and this Pinot Noir is a good value as well. Slightly dusty, floral notes add complexity to its spice and cherry aromas, while the mouthfeel is silky but not too soft. Finishes with hints of tea and rose petals. No need to wait on this one; drink now.",Vintage Widow,89,23.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Jackson Estate
131808,Spain,"This producer is doing a very good job with its superaffordable, no-dosage cava. The nose is lightly floral, with the accent on apple blossom. The palate is solid and crisp, with appropriate white-fruit flavors. Crisp on the finish, with a lively feel. A pleasurable sipper for sure.",Brut Zero Reserva,89,10.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Castellblanch
131809,Australia,"From the same Bakers Gully Vineyard as Clarendon Hills' Bakers Gully Shiraz, this is a full-bodied Shiraz with bold vanilla and saddle leather aromas and flavors of brambleberries. Rustic notes include hints of rubber or Band-Aid, but they're in the background, while warm berries, vanilla and roasted coffee notes lead the way. Drink now.",The Vincent,89,40.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Tapestry
131810,New Zealand,"Yields in 2005 were so low that “we had to send out search parties at harvest time,” jokes winemaker Peter Caldwell. This is a dark, almost inky, wine, with aromas and flavors of black cherries and plums, all wrapped in a slightly herbal edge of drying tannins. Hold and see if another year or two takes some of that edge off.",Runholder,89,30.0,Martinborough,,,Pinot Noir,Te Kairanga
131811,New Zealand,"Fresh, vibrant and tropical, this is a plump Sauvignon Blanc that replaces the green flavors of Marlborough Sauvignon with riper notes of cassis and pink grapefruit. Long on the finish.",,89,18.0,Martinborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Te Kairanga
131812,Spain,"A gem in the semisweet category, with touches of melon and banana on the nose. The palate pours on the sweet apple cider and warm citrus, while the finish is on the mark. This is a generous, no-brainer of a bubbly: Just uncork, pour, sip and smile.",Extra Dry,89,10.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
131813,US,"Shares so much of the quality of the Reserve that, at 30 bucks cheaper, you might as well buy this one. Soft, elegant and delicious in blackberry pie, cassis and chocolate flavors, it has wonderfully ripe tannins and finishes totally dry.",,89,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vin de Manies
131814,Spain,"Purple in color, with a sweet, fragrant bouquet featuring mostly plum and strawberry but also a touch of rusticity. Bold and full of cherry-cola flavors, while the feel is downright plush and proper. A very nice (and new to the market) wine from Torres; and there's no knocking its value qualifications.",Malena,89,10.0,Catalonia,Catalunya,,Garnacha,Torres
131815,Greece,"Dark earth, graham cracker and plush purple fruit aromas introduce a wealth of blueberry and black plum flavors wrapped in oaky spice. The wine is smooth from eight months in new French oak, though the oak could not fully tame such ripe, heavy tannins. Can be drunk over the next decade. A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Limnio.",Metoxi,89,20.0,Mount Athos,,,Cabernet Blend,Tsantali
131816,Australia,"Like many McLaren Vale Shirazes, this one seems to fall somewhere between the full-blown Barossa style and the herb- and spice-driven styles of cooler climates. There's a minty edge to the blackberry fruit, espresso notes similar to those found in the northern Rhône, and firm tannins on the finish. Try after 2008.",,89,21.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Wayne Thomas
131817,US,"Here's a well-behaved young Zin, dry and fruity, with firm tannins and acids that will cut through barbecue. The cherry, blackberry, cola and peppery pomegranate flavors will play beautifully against a rich, savory barbecue sauce.",Beeson Ranch,89,30.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
131818,US,"Seems made in a less ripe style, a minty, wintergreen wine with hints of barely ripened blackberries and some briary wild berries. Drinks bone dry and fairly tannic. If you're into an earthier, more French Bordeaux style, try this one. Will benefit from a decade of aging.",Tietjen Vineyard,89,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Elyse
131819,US,"Big, thick, soft, gooey, delicious, a little hot, that begins to describe this Rhône blend, which is Syrah, Grenache and a dash of Petite Sirah. It's all essence of cherries, melted chocolate, coffee, vanilla, cinnamon.",Revelation Red Wine,89,32.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,Epiphany
131820,Austria,"When Silvia Heinrich, Johann Heinrich's daughter (whose name is on this bottle) pushes the alcohol up to 14%, she somehow loses the intense varietal character. What we find instead is a powerful wine, with layers of wood, big spice and pepper and rounded black fruits, but one with no sense of place.",Cupido Péché Mignon,88,69.0,Burgenland,,,Blaufränkisch,Johann Heinrich
131821,Austria,"For Johann Heinrich, this wine is a celebration of Blaufränkisch. It goes back to a more rustic era in one sense, losing freshness, but gaining in depth of flavor, in structure and light wood flavors. It's worth aging for 2–3 years.",Vitikult,88,24.0,Burgenland,,,Blaufränkisch,Johann Heinrich
131822,US,"What an easy-drinking Zin, and it has real complexity, too. The flavors are of rich, chocolaty cherry, raspberry and blackberry flavors, with Zinny spices, while firm tannins and good acidity provide a rich structural balance. This is a lip-smackingly good Zinfandel.",,88,19.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Plungerhead
131823,Austria,"Friendly and fruity, made for everyday consumption, showing spice, red cherries and a flavor of minerality that manifests itself in the acidity. Partial aging in older barrels has softened the pure intensity of the fruit, but without adding wood flavors.",,88,19.0,Burgenland,,,Zweigelt,Paul Achs
131824,US,"This is a really nice Chardonnay. Sebastiani knows how to make a balanced varietal wine, and this clean, ripe Chardonnay completely satisfies, with fruity flavors and a rich balance of creamy oak, coastal acidity and spicy oak.",,88,13.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sebastiani
131825,US,"This is the kind of wine that goes with just about anything that goes with red. It's dry and completely balanced in acids and tannins, with a good mélange of cherries and mushroomy, earthy notes, and a silky, velvety mouthfeel. Really hard to find anything not to like.",,88,16.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Syrah,Sobon Estate
131826,Germany,"Citrus and green apple flavors mark this rather light-bodied auslese. It's crisp, clean and fresh, with tart lemon-lime flavors on the finish and some modestly minerally undercurrents. Drink now.",Auslese,88,13.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Rudolf Müller
131827,Italy,"A beautiful Venetian villa is surrounded by 200 acres of vineyard and is the setting in which this fine Amarone is crafted. Rhubarb, plum, black cherry exotic spice, espresso and caramel are backed by toast and cedar notes. It has chewy length, refreshing crispness and good power on the finish.",,88,60.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Tenute Galtarossa
131828,Argentina,"Hard black fruit and notes of tire rubber and tar indicate that this is a dark, masculine wine. And while it does offer power, it's actually quite racy and balanced in the mouth. Flavorwise, expect black raspberry and some bitter cocoa. Overall, there's nothing unripe about it.",Finca La Linda,88,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Luigi Bosca
131829,Austria,"This is the second level wine made from Pinot Noir by Gerhard Markowitsch. But it still exhibits great varietal flavor, with those piercing acid edges balanced with delicious red cherry fruits. Great freshness.",,88,,Carnuntum,,,Pinot Noir,Markowitsch
131830,Austria,"Fresh mulberry and blueberry fruits with a mineral edge give this structure and freshness; layered with firm, dry tannins. The acidity accentuates the juicy, chewy flavors. It could be drunk now, but 2–3 years aging will soften those tannins.",,88,,Carnuntum,,,Blaufränkisch,Markowitsch
131831,Austria,"A firmly tannic wine, solid and concentrated, which shows great spicy Zweigelt varietal flavor, as well as dense black cherries and toast. This is a wine that needs some aging, maybe over 3 years.",Vom Heideboden,88,16.0,Burgenland,,,Zweigelt,Nittnaus Hans und Christine
131832,US,"This is a new brand from Jess Jackson. The wine is quite interesting—absolutely dry, very tannic, acidic and austere, with a bitterness to the cherryskin flavors. Yet it possesses polish and elegance. Work is needed, but this is a Merlot to watch.",,88,35.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Pelton House
131833,Italy,"The Cantina Negrar line (this cooperative is also responsible for the well-known Domìni Veneti line) offers good value and this delivers dark concentration and ripe aromas of mature fruit, raisin, coffee grounds and leather.

131834,France,"Richness combined with minerality. Quince, honey and white pears are the dominant characters in this powerful, round wine; however, with its hot pepper element, this tastes of its alcohol. The acidity is here, but lost in the wood.",Le Bel Ouvrage,88,30.0,Loire Valley,Savennières,,Chenin Blanc,Damien Laureau
131835,Argentina,"Interesting Argentine Cabernet, with rooty, baked aromas that settle in and impress if given time. The palate is balanced by subtle red-fruit and earthy flavors, while the feel is stocky and grabby courtesy of strong tannins. A good wine with a lot of positives.",,88,17.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca Sophenia
131836,Germany,"Light to medium in body, this is a clean, fresh auslese, not a big, sugary blockbuster. Pineapple and honey aromas lead the way, adding green apple, mint and citrus flavors as the wine crosses the palate. To some, it may seem a bit green and underripe despite the ample residual sugar, while to others it will a welcome respite from many of the overripe ausleses that are actually declassified BAs.",Valwiger Herrenberg Auslese,88,29.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Dr. Zenzen
131837,US,"A little rugged in tannins, but rewarding for its wealth of cherries, cola, licorice, spice and sweet oak. Finishes dry and quite long. Could pick up some nuance in a few years.",Chamisal Vineyards,88,38.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Domaine Alfred
131838,Argentina,"After you chop your way through the black forest of char, roasted berry and coffee aromas, you'll encounter a pretty large mass of flavors that include blackberry, cola, root beer and cinnamon. It's a fairly packed and saturated wine at 14.9%, and the finish of mocha and chocolate accentuates the wine's oak elevage. Best for those who like ripeness and size. The blend is 60% Merlot and 40% Cab Sauvignon.",Calvulcura,88,25.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,Antucura
131839,US,"Kudos to the winery for picking at low brix and for keeping the residual sugar so low so that the wine is absolutely dry. It lets the palate really appreciate the acid-brightened flavors of exotic fruits, wildflowers, and, especially, Asian spices. The wine could be more concentrated, but it's still a good sipper.",Rhinefarm Vineyard,88,25.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Gewürztraminer,Gundlach Bundschu
131840,Austria,"St. Laurent is a speciality at Johanneshof Reinisch (they make 4 different wines from this varietal).

131842,Germany,"Ultraripe tropical fruits—even including hints of bananas—dominate this wine's heady aromas. Acids are soft, and alcohol fairly elevated—12.5%—for a wine of this prädikat.

Best for fans of hefty, New World reds.",Winemaker's Selection,88,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Andeluna
131844,Italy,"As far as Amarone goes, this version delivers general satisfaction and good quality but is also muddled by ripe flavors of strawberry comfiture, mushroom and wet soil that is probably due to overly mature fruit. Beyond those aromas are penetrating cherry flavors and a solid structure.",,88,40.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Aldegheri
131845,US,"I'm not sure Howell Mountain is the best place for Merlot, because the dry, rugged terrain imparts strong tannins that seem weird in this supposedly gentle red variety. This 100% Merlot has big cherry, blackberry, cocoa and sweet new oak flavors wrapped in a firmly astringent, sandpapery texture. Decanting will help. So will a rich, fatty steak.",,88,75.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Merlot,Luna
131846,US,"rich, very exotic, decadently drinkable, like an entire fruit store in a glass.

131847,US,"Crisper and a bit leaner than the Paso Robles offerings from J. Lohr, this is a flawlessly made Napa Cab, offering up plenty of smoke- and cedar-accented cassis fruit. With its structure and balance, it should drink well for up to 10 years.",Carol's Vineyard,88,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,J. Lohr
131848,US,"The winery was one of the first to specialize in Cab Franc, and Premier Etage is their reserve-style bottling. The '03 is a very good wine, but misses the richness of the '01 and '02.

131849,Italy,"Alfredo Buglioni, formally in textiles, bought this beautiful property in 1993 and is now completely dedicated to wine.

131850,US,"This is a tough wine in two ways. It's rather hard and brittle in acids and tannins now, and it's also tough to predict its future. It's rich in currant, blackberry jam, coffee and cedar flavors, but there is an undertow of raisins that could compromise its longterm viability.",Alexis,88,70.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Swanson
131851,US,"Released in October, 2007, this would have benefited from additional time in the bottle, but there's no reason you can't cellar it.

131852,Argentina,"A lot of different aromas are vying for attention; there's spearmint, potting soil, tobacco and black fruits. The palate is saturated and pretty deep for what can best be described as a “value” wine. Flavors of blackberry and dark plums are wholesome and tasty. It's nicely balanced on the whole, with medium tannins.",Reserva,88,9.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz,Nieto Senetiner
131853,US,"The Stoller bottling from Chehalem shows some dark, musky flavors, with black cherry fruit wrapped around whiffs of smoke and the commonly found Oregon notes of tomato leaf and bud.

131857,US,"Tasted in September ‘07, this Cab was pretty high in tannins, giving it a tough astringency some folks won't like. But the wine is clean and complex, with blackberry, tobacco and sage flavors.

131860,Australia,"Kilikanoon's blended Cabernet is a solid effort, it just falls short of the consistent excellence of the winery's Rhône varieties.

Well, the fact that it's varietal Petit Verdot from the Duero River Valley, which is not common; that and the fact that it's a mind-boggling $200.

131883,New Zealand,"This is a full-bodied, supple rendition of Marlborough Pinot Noir, boasting smoky, slightly herbal-peppery scents and bold cherry and plum fruit. There's a suggestion of sassafras or cola as well, which gives this wine an almost Californian flavor. Long and velvety on the finish.",Hatter's Hill,90,29.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Delta Vineyard
131884,Spain,"No complaints—just praise for this clean, easy red from a great vintage. The nose is crisp and fruity, with welcome citrus and wood notes. Blackberry mixed with vanilla and chocolate create a pleasant palate, while the finish is round and tinged by mocha.",Glorioso Reserva,90,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
131885,France,"This Chardonnay-dominated wine (70% to just 30% Pinot Noir) is the top cuvée from the quality-conscious Beaumont des Crayères cooperative. It is a well-balanced wine, with some toast from barrique vinification. It's ripe, already quite soft and ready to drink. Not available in the U.S.",Nostalgie Brut,90,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Beaumont des Crayères
131886,Argentina,"A classic modern wine with plenty of vanilla, almond and baked apple on the rich, nutty bouquet. Flavors of peach, toasted nuts and bread are stylish and elegant, while a beam of acidity keeps it perfectly balanced. A great little find from Argentina.",Finca La Escondida Reserva,90,16.0,Other,San Juan,,Chardonnay,Andean
131887,France,"This wine is all about finesse and elegance. Aromas of grapefruit and other citrus fruits are enticing. On the palate, the wine is toasty, with orange marmalade and honey flavors, and fresh acidity.",Brut,90,60.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Laurent-Perrier
131888,Argentina,"It's not often that Bonarda makes a point, but this new one from Trapiche's Broquel label is exemplary. The bouquet pumps out mint, tobacco, black cherry and toasted oak, while the blackberry-drenched palate is pure pleasure. With a steak, this is a sure bet. And it won't break the bank.",Broquel,90,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Trapiche
131889,South Africa,"A very pure line of blackberry and dark cherry flavors distinguish this wine. It is certainly structured—underneath the fruit there are plenty of fruit and wood tannins—but the ripe fruit flavors dominate. Based on fruit from the Jonkershoek valley, this shows a fine minerally side, compliments of the granite subsoil.",Stark,90,27.0,Stellenbosch,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stark-Condé
131890,US,"Balanced and elegant, yet with all the briary, wild character of Zin, this wine, a blend of Russian River and Alexander Valley, captures the spirit of Sonoma Zin. It's nice and dry and balanced, with polished blackberry, blueberry, mocha and spice flavors.",Knotty Vines,90,19.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rodney Strong
131891,New Zealand,"This medium-bodied Riesling combines relatively high alcohol (13%) with ample residual sugar to add even greater richness and mouthfeel. But because of its excellent levels of acidity, it doesn't come across as particularly sweet or heavy. Tangerine, apple and spice notes linger elegantly on the finish.",Rastasburn,90,25.0,Central Otago,,,Riesling,Peregrine
131892,US,"A blend of grapes from two vineyards, including Bien Nacido, this polished Pinot shows the crushed hard spices and deep, black-cherry flavors typical of the appellation. It's still a young wine, brimming with acids and tannins, and is drinkable now, but has the stuffing for medium-term aging. It's a good value for a Santa Barbara Pinot of this quality.",,90,25.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Byron
131893,US,"There's massive flavor in this wine, made from young Dijon clone vines. It's a real bomb blast of juicy apricot, pineapple custard, white peach nectar, tapioca and honeysuckle, with a tangy mineral flourish. Almost too rich for its own good, but retains balance, with good acidity.",Clone 76,90,35.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Foley
131894,US,"This is from the talented team at Foley, a Rhône blend of Syrah, Cinsault and Grenache. Pale in color, the wine is extremely dry, with high acidity and nuanced flavors of rose petals, dried herbs, grapefruit zest and dusty white pepper. One of the best rosés of the vintage, it's terrific with bouillabaisse.",Rose Wine,90,12.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Rosé,Foley & Phillips
131895,South Africa,"The bouquet may take a while to come around, but when it does you'll know what you're in for. Strong tropical fruit aromas have a citrusy side, leading to a very tropical mouthfeel with a smooth, oaked feel and solid acidity. Its 60% Sauvignon Blanc offers grippy grass and grapefruit flavors, while 40% Chenin Blanc adds mango and nutty notes. Finishes with warm, spicy oak.",The Old Man's Blend,90,15.0,Coastal Region,,,White Blend,Groote Post
131896,US,"I love this wine for its acidic dryness, which is Sauvignon Blanc's first duty. The wine has a refreshing tartness, relieved by rich lime zest and green apple flavors, with a scour of grapefruit. With no oak at all, it's one classy sipper.",,90,20.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Hall
131897,France,"Charles Heidsieck's rosé has a reputation for aging well—but 1999 seems to be an exception, since it is already mature. It shows some good biscuit and baked-cookie flavors, but still retains its strawberry jam fruits. It is rich, soft and very fruity, with the acidity only showing from the background.",Brut Rosé,90,80.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Charles Heidsieck
131898,Portugal,"The name sounds Italian, but this is made in Portugal's Douro Valley, up in the hills near the Spanish border. According to the importer, it's a blend of indigenous Códega, Viosinho and Rabigato grapes. Whatever it is, it shows skillfully managed barrel treatment in its lush, rich, creamy texture and vanilla notes, but those elements seamlessly blend with ripe citrus (think oranges or tangerines) and gingery spice. A long finish cements this wine's impressive quality.",Branco Reserva,90,12.0,Douro,,,White Blend,Castello d'Alba
131899,France,"A full-bodied style, dominated by flavors of almonds, which indicate that this is moving from fruity youth to maturity. But there is still plenty of acidity there.

131900,US,"Ed Filice is the winemaker at Tolosa Winery, in Edna Valley. This Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon blend is dry, fairly tannic, soft and ripe in dark fruit and milk chocolate flavors, with a nice licorice and pepper edge. At its best now, it shows real complexity and elegance.",Joseph George Cépage,90,30.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,La Filice
131901,US,"While this Zin is clinically dry, it's so explosive in cherry, rhubarb, pomegranate and cola flavors that it's almost sweet, like pie filling. The acids and tannins rush in at the last minute, balancing it with a dusty dryness. It's a classically ripe coastal Zin, and savvy sommeliers will have fun figuring out what to pair it with.",Feeney Vineyard,90,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
131902,South Africa,"This mature wine is the top Bordeaux blend from the Malan family estate. With rich, red plum and black jammy fruits, this wine does not hold its big, bold tastes back. But with great, spicy flavors and a layer of dry tannins that appears at the end, it will stand up to rich foods.",Tiara,90,30.0,Stellenbosch,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Simonsig
131903,US,"Here's an industrial strength Petite Sirah, from vineyards in the hotter, northern part of the valley. It's a bold, powerful wine that slams the palate with blackberry marmalade and chocolate flavors that coat the mouth and last for a long time. For all that, this only-in-California wine is fully dry. Be warned, the alcohol is 16%.",Pickett Road,90,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Petite Sirah,Rosenblum
131904,France,"A richly soft, creamy wine, dominated by flavors of white currants and chives, this is full-bodied and still young. There is enough ripe acidity and full-flavored fruit to see it develop well over five years.",Minéral Blanc de Blancs Brut,90,50.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Agrapart & Fils
131905,US,"This isn't a cheap wine, but it's a good value compared to more costly Russian River Pinots. It's classy, showing Pinot's silky elegance with delicious cherry, cola and tea flavors. Hard to imagine a more versatile Pinot; will go with everything from salmon to steak.",,90,25.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Alderbrook
131906,Spain,"One of the best red wines we've tried from Alicante. It's based on Monastrell, with other grapes thrown in. The result is a complex winner that smells like dark cherries and tastes like a swirl of raspberry, plum and chocolate. Very well balanced considering how warm 2003 was.",Beryna,90,17.0,Levante,Alicante,,Red Blend,Bodegas Bernabe Navarro
131907,Portugal,"Incredibly nutty on the nose, with hints of citrus and caramel. On the palate, lemon and orange flavors take off, although hints of honey-roasted nuts continue in the background. This is a fresh, mostly dry-seeming Madeira with a long, intense finish.",Colheita Medium Rich,90,32.0,Madeira,,,Bual,Cossart Gordon
131908,Argentina,"Rock steady from opening to close. The nose is earthy and toasty, but it's the dark-fruit notes that score the major points. Zesty and full of ribald black cherry, raspberry and chocolate flavors. Finishes with another helping of fudge, and in the final analysis it fills the tank to the brim.",Reserve,90,42.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Melipal
131909,South Africa,"From one of the Cape's coolest wine regions, this Marlbrook, grown in Constantia, has great structure and dry tannins that reveal cassis fruit underneath. It is very dry at present, a sign of aging potential, but also means it will be a great accompaniment to rich meat dishes. Not imported.",Marlbrook,90,,Constantia,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Klein Constantia
131910,Italy,"A fabulous Friulano-based wine (with 10% Malvasia and 10% Ribolla Gialla), Carat is a rich and intense wine that will certainly last another five to 10 years in the cellar. Its quality is evident thanks to the velvety and rich feel the wine imparts in the mouth and its bright aromas of peach and apricot. This wine has extraordinary length on the finish too. To be released fall 2009.",Carat,92,34.0,Northeastern Italy,Venezia Giulia,,White Blend,Bressan
131911,US,"A lovely Sauvignon Blanc that shows classic Napa balance, with a savory crispness that invites pairing with goat cheese, grilled veggies or roasted halibut.

131913,US,"A beautiful example of a fine Alexander Valley Cab, with dusty tannins and an herbal, thyme and sage note to the ripe blackberries, cherries, currants and cedar.

131914,US,"Nothing shy about this powerhouse Syrah. A barrel selection from Morgan's cool-climate vineyard, it's bone dry and strong in acids and tannins, with underlying flavors of blackberries, sour cherries, tobacco, mint, anise and spices, especially crushed black peppercorn.

131915,US,"This is a new bottling for Phillips Hill, and a promising one.

Just beautiful, and should develop through 2013.",Corby Vineyard,92,40.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Phillips Hill
131916,Portugal,"A serious, impressive wine, packed with the dark tannins of Touriga Nacional. It also has an elegance that gives it shape, structure and surprising poise for such a rich, juicy wine.

131917,US,"Bright and spicy and loaded with great, clean, pure fruit flavors. This is exemplary for the '06 vintage; a wine of lovely purity and focus.

131918,US,"Few winemakers in California understand acidity better than Randall Grahm, and he provides plenty of it in this brilliantly clean, bone-dry wine.

131921,Argentina,"Smoky and sultry smelling, with berry jam aromas and ample subtleties. The palate is tannic and lively, like a good, masculine youngster should be.

Could use a year, but it's drinkable now with steak.",Henry Gran Guarda,91,50.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Lagarde
131922,Australia,"Greenock is a highly regarded subsection of the Barossa, and this is a fine example of Shiraz from that region.

131923,Spain,"The nose is all dense blackberries, while the palate is deep, flashy and ripe, with flavors of black cherry and blackberry.

Drink now through 2012.",Élite,91,36.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Muruve
131924,US,"This is quite a good Pinot Noir, and one to drink now for its silky deliciousness.

Hard to imagine anyone not liking it a lot.",Coster Vineyard,91,42.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Vision Cellars
131925,Australia,"The aromas of this wine are undoubtedly complex: meaty, stewy, cedary and jammy—there's a lot going on, just not all going in the same direction. Yet it seems to come together on the palate, where it offers a creamy, mouthfilling texture, turning chewier on the finish. Hints of chocolate, coffee, molasses, mixed berries and peppery spice make for a rich, intense blend of flavors. Drink now–2020.",,91,38.0,South Australia,Langhorne Creek,,Shiraz,Brothers in Arms
131926,US,"There's a lot of oak on this Chard, sourced from multiple vineyards, and the barrel influences currently dominate, with the vanilla, butterscotch and caramel flavors many people confuse with the taste of Chardonnay itself. In this case, the underlying pineapple, pear and green apple fruit is ample enough to support all that weight.",Tré Terre,91,34.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
131927,US,"Herbal, peppery, tannic and slightly green, but very flavorful and interesting. Green coffee bean flavors are pure varietal; the tannins are tight and compact, with penetrating flavors.

131928,Portugal,"Made from the vineyards of Casa de Santar, this is the result of an exercise in old-style white wine making, but without the oxidation.

131929,Hungary,"A beautiful, aromatic nose of honey, orange, apricot and spice unfolds extravagantly in this elegant dessert wine. Poised tones of honey, citrus, caramel and vanilla are rich but clean on the palate, thanks to a good acidity. The wine ends with a tart grapefruit spin.",Aszú 6 Puttonyos - 500 ml,91,100.0,Tokaji,,,Tokaji,Disznókö
131930,Germany,"Right now the aromas are a bit tight—even steely—with just modest hints of apple and lime, but the fruit comes to the fore on the palate, exploding with baked apple and spice flavors, balanced by zippy acids. Best from 2011–2015.",Ürziger Würzgarten Spätlese,91,26.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Karl Erbes
131931,Australia,"This likeable blend of 45% Grenache, 30% Shiraz and 25% Mataro (Mourvèdre) features a mix of intense red fruits—raspberries and cherries—and minty, herbal complexity.

131933,US,"With different vineyard sources and blend from the excellent 2006, this is still a clear improvement, with true varietal character. White pepper, clove, herb, earth and still-sharp, angular berry fruit; fading into baking chocolate finish. The listed alcohol remains under 14%.",Reserve,91,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Waterbrook
131934,Australia,"A large, relatively new winery in Western Australia's Margaret River GI, Watershed has turned out an admirable 2004 Shiraz, boasting a cool-climate note of cracked pepper that accents its raspberry and mint aromas and flavors. It's crisp and medium-bodied, creamy upfront, then turning firmer on the finish. Drink or hold 3–4 years.",,91,19.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Shiraz,Watershed
131935,Portugal,"Many see the Touriga Nacional in the Dão as superior to the same grape in the Douro.

The structure is solid, with a firm, spicy elegance.",,91,32.0,Dão,,,Touriga Nacional,Quinta dos Roques
131936,Portugal,"A tight, juicy wine, with powerful new wood aromas and flavors. The tannins are taut, dense, with a steely mineral edge, cranberry skin structure, followed by bright acidity. Like other Alvaro Castro wines, this needs time to age.",Quinta da Pellada Reserva,91,,Dão,,,Portuguese Red,Alvaro Castro
131937,US,"Ripe, lush and immediately attractive, this Chard offers rich tiers of pineapple custard, pear marmalade, vanilla, buttered toast, toasted coconut and Asian spice flavors.

131938,Germany,"Knyphausen's 2007 Erstes Gewächs wines from Erbach make a stunning couple. The Marcobrunn comes across as slightly cooler, not quite as rich or dense as the Steinmorgen, but possible more elegant. The apple, melon, citrus and mineral notes are delicately interwoven on the long, classy finish.",Erbacher Marcobrunn Erstes Gewächs,91,,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Baron Knyphausen
131939,US,"The 2005 Ursa is similar in style to the previous blends – 55% Merlot, 28% Cab Franc, 7% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Malbec and 3% Petit Verdot. A nice ripe vintage, it's a beefy version of this popular Bordeaux blend, with more black fruits than red, and somewhat rugged, substantial, lightly earthy tannins. As always, it remains forward and accessible, drinking quite nicely, but a bit more cellar worthy in this excellent vintage.",Ursa,91,39.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Baer
131940,Italy,"Notes of fresh melon and peach come as a big surprise if you consider the wine's age. Apparently, its built to last thanks to tones of vanilla, banana and toasted nut. It has a raw, nutty characteristic and a spice-driven finish. Drink now.",Vigneto Rizzardo,87,36.0,Veneto,Colli di Conegliano,,White Blend,Masottina
131941,Argentina,"A touch of coconut and cream accents the dark-fruited bouquet, while the palate is less overtly oaky and more emphatic with its plum and berry flavors. No doubt this is a chewy, ripe, fruit-forward style. It's not for aging nor contemplating; best to just drink it down with meats and pastas.",,87,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Mil Piedras

131943,Argentina,"A touch of oak on this wine leads to a kiss of vanilla and wax on the nose alongside melon and peach scents. The palate is full of zing and lemon, and underneath there's more in the way of orange marmalade. Finishes long and lemony, with some natural heat.",Don David Reserve,87,15.0,Other,Cafayate,,Torrontés,Michel Torino
131944,Argentina,"Dynamic aromas of honeysuckle and mint gumdrop precede intense honey, orange, tangerine and marmalade flavors. This is a thicker, more oily style of Torrontes than the commonly seen watery ones, and it makes a statement via its viscosity and power.",Cuma Organic,87,13.0,Other,Cafayate,,Torrontés,Michel Torino
131945,Italy,"This wine offers a nice mix of typical Sauvignon aromas such as fresh fruit, sage and tomato leaf, and also appears less sharp than other versions of the grape with low-key acidity that is never pointed or thorny.",Indra,87,20.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Sauvignon,Girlan

131948,US,"There's heat in this high alcohol wine, but it's okay, a chili pepper burn that's works with the fruity, herbal flavors the way a hit of jalapeño heightens a mango salsa. Although the wine is a bit sweet in the finish, it's a natural for barbecue.",Snow Vineyard,87,36.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Peachy Canyon
131949,US,"A non-vintage blend of 42% Cabernet Franc, 29% Cabernet Sauvignon and 29% Sangiovese, this is built upon strong, herbal tannins.

131950,US,"There's a deep, ultraripe core of cherry and blackberry fruit to this wine that's almost shriveled. You can sense that hint of raisins in the finish, which is very dry and on the astringently tannic side. It's a nicely fashionable wine, but not an ager, so drink now.",Ellen's Block,87,30.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Russian Hill
131951,Italy,"SalvaTerra is a relatively new estate with high altitude vineyards at the back of the Classico zone, just before the hills of Valpolicella soar up to the Dolomites.

131953,US,"A pure Sangiovese, it shows the lighter colors of the grape, and offers quite soft, round fruit flavors of plum and ripe strawberry. Full-bodied (for Sangio) and almost lush, it's a user-friendly style that de-emphasizes the grape's natural acidity and ripens it to almost 15% alcohol. There's not a lot of detail here, just round, sweet fruit.",,87,28.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Sangiovese,Walter Dacon
131954,New Zealand,"Plummy yet herbal at the same time, this Pinot from the folks at Craggy Range hints at rhubarb and beet greens, but relies on a sturdy core of sour plum to carry it. It's a bit chunky, with a dusting of tannins on the finish. Imported by Kobrand Corporation.",Cupids Arrow,87,18.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Wild Rock
131955,US,"Nice spice and strawberry fruit. The blend is a mish-mash—half Merlot, the rest Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Cab Franc, Viognier and Malbec. Not that it makes a huge difference in a rosé, but it does seem a bit diffuse as a result. Nonetheless, a good sipping wine.",,87,15.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Rosé,Kestrel
131956,Argentina,"Chardonnay in sunny, high-altitude Cafayate will always prove challenging, but this wine gets it right. There's a lot of spicy forward oak, and thus the palate is expectedly creamy and tinged with vanilla, cinnamon and white pepper notes along with pineapple and mango fruit. The feel and body are both correct and textured. It's sweet and oaky but well made.",Don David Reserve,87,15.0,Other,Cafayate,,Chardonnay,Michel Torino
131957,Italy,"Although this wine opens with a lively ruby color, it segues into tired, somewhat lifeless aromas of resin, tar, cherry liquor, earth and deep toasted notes.

131958,France,"On the soft side, this ripe, full wine is typical of the vintage.

131968,US,"There is a little bit of leathery funk in some of the barrels, but it's subtle enough to be a feature rather than a flaw. Dark, tarry and smoky, this is a firm, bright wine.

It's a very ripe, fruity Bordeaux blend, brimming with blackberry, cherry, licorice and cola flavors, and is flat-out delicious, except for those astringent tannins.

131979,Spain,"A clear step up from the overdone 2003 Propiedad, this vintage is sweet and easy to like. There's a blast of hickory smoke on the new-oak nose, but also black fruit and molasses. The ripe palate deals chewy fruit, medium tannins and moderate length. It's a charming but blunt wine, and all in all it's probably not one to hold for too long. Drink now through 2009.",Propiedad,91,40.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Palacios Remondo
131980,US,"Few wines out of Napa Valley need age as much as this one does. That's due to its mountain origins and the cool vintage, which combine to make the tannins pushy and hard.

It's explosive in oak-infused pineapple, papaya, peach, green apple and Asian spice flavors, but right now the oak is not integrated with the fruit, making for a disjointed quality.

132048,US,"Lusty and strong, this is Lodi Zinfandel at its most classic. It's a big, thick, softly ripe wine that floods the mouth with exuberant flavors of blackberry jam, chocolate, red and black currants and peppery spices. Easy to like. Drink now.",The Zin,88,25.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Zinfandel,Cosentino
132049,Italy,"Delicate fragrances of blue flowers, pressed violets, exotic spice and white pepper emerge from the nose of this Nebbiolo from the Langhe. The wine shares a lot in common with its big brothers Barbaresco and Barolo, including a firm tannic finish.",,88,24.0,Piedmont,Nebbiolo d'Alba,,Nebbiolo,Damilano
132050,US,"Erath's Oregon Pinot Noir may quickly become the most widely available, moderately priced example of this state's iconic varietal. This new vintage is tight and herbal, with true varietal character and Burgundian elegance. Tart red berries, hints of citrus rind, moderating acid and fine balance throughout.",,88,19.0,Oregon,Oregon,Oregon Other,Pinot Noir,Erath
132051,US,"Sharp in acidity, which gives the mouthfeel excessive tartness. Otherwise it's a very rich wine, with deep, complex flavors of cherry preserves, raspberries, cola, cranberries and red currants, accented by smoky oak. The sharpness seems to limit ageability.",Famous Gate,88,68.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Domaine Carneros
132052,France,"Importer Bobby Kacher has a seemingly limitless portfolio of bargains from the south of France, and this one boasts an intriguing nose of pear, honey and star anise. It's more focused and crisp than many wines from this region, turning citrusy on the finish. Drink now-2012.",,88,13.0,Rhône Valley,Costières de Nîmes,,White Blend,Domaine de la Petite Cassagne
132053,Greece,"Citrus, tropical fruit and a crisp minerally burst give this dry white a unique flair. Overall, the wine is clean and light—a great cohort to grilled fish or Mediterranean cuisine. Classic and elegant with a terroir-driven edge.",Thalassitis,88,25.0,Santorini,,,Assyrtico,Gaia Wines
132054,Italy,"Beautifully pale pink in color with delicate shadings of peach and copper, this is an extremely elegant rosé sparkler from the Franciacorta area of northern Italy. The aromas are simple and straightforward, focusing on rose petal, cranberry and peach. The mouthfeel is crisp and easy.",Brut Rosé Millesimato,88,28.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,Fratelli Berlucchi
132055,Italy,"This Nebbiolo from the Langhe exhibits a bright ruby color and lean density. Measured aromas of wild berry, licorice, asphalt and balsam-menthol notes describe the nose. The mouthfeel, on the other hand, is streamlined, tight and marked by firm tannins.",,88,28.0,Piedmont,Langhe,,Nebbiolo,Giacomo Fenocchio
132056,Portugal,"A broad, welcoming wine, the second label from Malhadinha Nova. It has spiced acidity, flavors of plums, licorice, with cranberry juice tannins. The flavors are big and bold, nothing held back.",Monte da Peceguina Tinto,88,30.0,Alentejano,,,Portuguese Red,Herdade da Malhadinha Nova
132057,US,"Fleshy and ripe, with blackberry and currant flavors just beginning to turn the curve from primary fruit and cocoa to bottle bouquet. Picking up notes of dried fruits and dried flowers. Yet the tannins are still firm and acidity still cuts across the middle. A little unbalanced but interesting. Now–2012.",Stagecoach Vineyard Veraison Synchrony,88,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Krupp Brothers
132058,US,"Here's a really good value in a dry, full-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon. It's filled with varietal flavors of blackberries and black currants, with a long, sweet finish. The tannins are sturdy and ripe. Fully ready now.",,88,14.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hahn Estates
132059,Spain,"Tough, earthy berry aromas provide a fierce outlook. The palate answers the call, showing syrupy richness amid piercing tannins. Flavors of baked black fruits yield to molasses on the short, stout finish. Tannic and solid, but very sweet. Could it use a bit more balance perhaps?",Gago,88,34.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Red Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
132060,Italy,"From the 2004 vintage, this wine's age and sophistication shows in the form of butterscotch, caramel, toasted bread, apricot and dried fruit. There is piquant spice on the close with elements of clove and white pepper (the blend here is 70-30 Chardonnay and Pinot Nero).",Cabochon Brut,92,55.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,Monte Rossa
132061,US,"A big, bold and beautiful Cabernet. Will appeal to those who like the California style, although Bordeauxphiles will find it too ripe and fruity. Brims with blackberries, black cherries, currants, licorice and sweet toasted oak, wrapped into firm, mountain tannins. Now–2014.",,92,65.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Barnett
132062,US,"Fragrant, fascinating and flat-out delicious, this is one of the top offerings of Gewürztraminer from anywhere in Oregon. Scents of rose petals, citrus oil, pine needle and lime skin pour forth; the flavors are crisply defined, elegant, lingering and in perfect balance. Technically off-dry, this has the acidity and focus to be most flexible with a wide variety of Asian foods.",,92,16.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Southern Oregon,Gewürztraminer,Brandborg
132063,France,"Intensely rich in character, touched lightly by new wood, the acidity crispening the ripe orange and sweet peach skin texture. This is a gorgeous, opulent wine.",,92,,Bordeaux,Barsac,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Doisy-Védrines
132064,New Zealand,"Dry River doesn't get a ton of press for its Chardonnay, but this is a terrific example of what Martinborough can do. Restrained toast and oak-spice elements complement fruits that range from melon to apple and citrus. It's medium in body, with a long, crisp, citrusy finish. Drink it over the next 5–6 years.",,92,60.0,Martinborough,,,Chardonnay,Dry River
132065,US,"Very rich and extracted, with massive flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants that taste like they were baked into a pastry, and sprinkled with cocoa, anise, vanilla and a touch of salt and black pepper. Delicious and forward, and should hold steady over the next six years.",,92,60.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Coniglio
132066,US,"A beautiful Merlot, actually one of the best ones out there now. Shows a brilliant Napa structure, with refined tannins housing red cherry, red currant, cola and cedar flavors nicely grounded with a touch of fine herbs and violets. A lovely, gentler alternative to Cabernet with a fine steak.",,92,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Madorom
132067,US,"Tough and chewy now, with a fibrous, tannic mouthfeel like a bite of beef jerky. Similar flavors, too, of teriaki beef, but the underlying fruit is massive, offering waves of cherries, black raspberries, currants and cola. This is a very fine wine, but an immature one. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar, if you can keep your hands off.",Coopersmith,92,54.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
132068,US,"Marked by strong, dry tannins now, which lock it down and make it astringent through the finish. Yet beneath the toughness is plenty of ripe fruit, with waves of blackberries and black currants. Oak shows up as toast, and also contributes to the tannins. Nowhere near ready, this wine should begin to come into its own after 2011.",Sycamore Vineyard,92,70.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Freemark Abbey
132069,Italy,This Millesimato sparkling blend of Pinot Nero and oak-aged Chardonnay delivers a generous and creamy mouthfeel followed by refined aromas of dried fruit and baked bread. This is a beautiful wine to serve with tempura appetizers.,Millesimato Brut,92,52.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,La Montina
132070,US,"Interesting flavors in this dry Rhône-style blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah. They range from cherries, red currants and raspberries to teriaki beef, bacon, cola and buttered cinnamon toast, with all sorts of exotic Asian spices. It's quite a tannic wine, and very dry. Shows a certain nobility, but you'll want to decant it, even overnight, to let it breathe.",Cuvée Constantine,92,40.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,Demetria
132071,US,"Peju's regular Cab Franc, released a year ago, was immediately drinkable. This reserve, with a tiny case production, is denser and more tannic, but shows the same charm. It's a fat, fleshy wine, with luscious black cherry tart, cola and caramelized oak flavors. Fine now, and should develop for 5–7 years.",Reserve Estate Bottled,92,95.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Franc,Peju
132072,South Africa,"Assertive and intense with a dark cocoa, black cherry and violet nose, this wine is smooth, dark and mysterious. Black fruit, warming spice and a touch of tobacco unfold on the palate, and the finish is lush and lingering. An elegant, sultry wine with aging potential.",,92,40.0,Stellenbosch,,,Shiraz,Muratie
132073,US,"A lovely wine that makes the case for bottling Cab Franc on its own. Shows beautifully ripe, fine Napa tannins with complex flavors of red cherries, red currants, licorice, cola and cedar. Think of it as a Cabernet Sauvignon that's lighter in body and more elegant.",Estate Bottled,92,45.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Franc,William Harrison
132074,Spain,"Rich and pruney, with bold, reduced black fruit aromas along with chocolate and spice. Compact and delicious in the mouth, with caramel, black coffee and other yummy, unctuous flavors. So thick it pours like motor oil, thus feel free to drink it like a wine or pour it on vanilla ice cream as you might a syrup.",Don Guido Aged 20 Years Rare Old Sweet,92,50.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Pedro Ximénez,Williams & Humbert
132075,US,"Marked by a lean minerality, this Chablis-style wine is not one of those fat, opulent Chards that dazzles with sheer richness. It's more subtle than that, and more acidic. Structure, in fact, is the name of the game here, with its lemon and lime flavors that barely break into green apples. Fine now, if not served too cold, and for the next 2–4 years. Beyond that, wines of this kind go quickly downhill.",Hat Trick Double L Vineyard,92,65.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Morgan
132076,US,"Very consistent in style with previous vintages, this textural, lemony, racy Riesling seems bone dry, though it is noted as having 1% residual sugar. Along with rich flavors of grapefruit and citrus, there are nectarine and pear fruit highlights and a sharp minerality.",Corral Creek,92,24.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Riesling,Chehalem
132077,France,"There are big flavors of botrytis here, giving a wine with power and concentration. The texture is muscular, tightness surrounding botrytis and layering with pineapple acidity and apricots.",,92,,Bordeaux,Sauternes,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Rabaud-Promis
132078,US,"Mainly Syrah, with a splash of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Viognier, this polished wine is marked by things that are red: red cherries, red currants and red licorice. It's dry, full bodied and tannic. When you swallow, astrigency remains behind, with the aftertaste of crushed red pepper. Lovely and complex, it's a wine to decant.",North Slope Estate,92,35.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,Demetria
132079,US,"Pure and detailed, this lovely Chardonnay carves its way through the palate with layers of pear tart, apple crisp, brioche and almond paste. It is an elegant wine, light and penetrating, with a finish that seems to linger forever.",Summum,92,100.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay,Evening Land
132080,Italy,"From the distant 2004 vintage, this pink and peach-colored sparkler offers yeasty tones of freshly baked bread and subtle notes of red berries and apricot. The wine is tonic and firm in the mouth with a creamy, foamy aftertaste. Beautiful and delicate.",Perlé Rosé Brut,92,60.0,Northeastern Italy,Trento,,Sparkling Blend,Ferrari
132081,US,"Dramatic in depth and structure, a cool-climate Syrah that will benefit from some time in the cellar. Deeply saturated in color, bone dry and full bodied, it offers ripe flavors of blackberries and black currants, with plenty of black pepper and sweet, chewy leather. Now, with decanting, and through 2013.",Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard,92,35.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Dutton-Goldfield
132082,France,"A big, solid wine, foursquare and chunky. The fruit directs its plum fruit flavors to richness, some sweetness, with coffee and licorice as added complexity. There is a great tight wood element giving dryness.",Château Tour Blanche,92,20.0,Bordeaux,Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Bernard Magrez
132083,Italy,"Here's a pale pink sparkler that would serve beautifully at weddings and special outdoor occasions. The wine is delicate and tonic, with pretty aromas of small berries and yeasty bread. It is firm, refreshing and extremely elegant on the close.",Gran Cuvée Brut Rosé,92,,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,Bellavista
132084,Italy,"There are impressive aromas here of stone and passion fruits, dried herbs and thick, nutty overtones at the back. The acidity is refreshing and cool but the wine also boasts solid, firm structure. Try this sparkler with smoked salmon canapés.",Gran Cuvée Satèn,92,,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Chardonnay,Bellavista
132085,US,"A beautiful Zin, dry and spicy. Shows lush, intricate flavors of blackberries, black raspberries, anise, pepper, cola and cedar. A very fine interpretation of a dusty Sonoma Zinfandel.",Branham Rockpile Vineyard,92,30.0,California,Rockpile,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hobo
132086,Italy,"Here's a complex and sophisticated sparkler with beautiful aromas of stone fruit, freshly baked bread, pressed flowers and crushed white pepper. The wine tastes rich and thick in the mouth and ends with piquant effervescence.",Gran Cuvée Pas Operé Extra Brut,92,,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,Bellavista
132087,US,This barrel selection from the best estate vineyards is given just 10 months aging in 30% new oak. The fruit is exceptional – a mix of red berries with tasteful threads of caramel sneaking into the finish. Let it breathe—it's a baby—but very nicely proportioned and showing layers of detail throughout a lingering finish.,Elizabeth's Reserve,92,48.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Adelsheim
132088,US,"Hobo's Zins are almost always among the most balanced and elegant out there, while preserving the variety's spicy, briary personality.

Drink now.",Treborce Vineyard,92,30.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hobo
132089,US,"Doesn't have quite the sheer ravishing power of the winery's Trace Ridge Cabernet, but this Cab-based Bordeaux blend is nuanced and possibly more complex and Bordeaux-like. The flavors are of currants, blackberries, cherries, anise and cedar, aged in 78% new French oak. Give it until 2011 to mellow.",Highlands Estates Trace Ridge,92,75.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Kendall-Jackson
132090,Italy,"Started in the Soave region, this producer bought vineyards in Valpolicella to include hearty reds in its portfolio. In some distant way, those white winemaking techniques seem to be behind this Amarone. Its aromas are floral and soapy—wild rose and lavender—and very fragrant with undertones of scented candle or incense. The tannins are firm and the finish is long.",,88,55.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Ca' Rugate
132091,Argentina,"Touches of tree bark, nutmeg and aged cheese give the nose diversity compared to the standard blackberry and vanilla, and in the mouth the wine is full of cola, root beer and other savory flavors in addition to berry fruit. It's a bit grabby and tannic, but overall it is quite good.",Reserve,88,17.0,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,El Rosal
132092,Austria,"The aroma is all spice. To taste, there's plenty of spice as well, but the fruit is almost extravagant in its sweetness, vibrancy and very forward character. Too much? No, it all works, and it's totally drinkable.",Blaufränkisch-Cabernet,88,21.0,Neusiedlersee-Hügelland,,,Red Blend,Gunter Triebaumer
132093,France,"A light, very fresh style of Sancerre, with fine flinty, mineral character. Plenty of citrus and fresh pears give this an easy, vibrant style. A wine to drink over the next year.",,88,20.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine des Grandes Perrières
132094,US,"A silky, delicate, almost lightweight Pinot Noir, this is a pretty wine, the antithesis of full-bodied and lusty. Yet it still packs in plenty of flavor and complexity, ranging from cola and sassafras to cherries, mushrooms, brown sugar and earth. Drink now.",,88,18.0,California,Los Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dancing Bear Cellars
132095,Austria,"Thermenregion, just west of Vienna, is getting a reputation for its international varietal red wines. This Pinot Noir shows how, even at a good, value-drinking level, the wines have good intensity and complex flavors. This has black cherry flavors, along with a touch of wood. A delicious ready-to-drink wine.",Classic,88,24.0,Thermenregion,,,Pinot Noir,Christian Fischer

132097,US,"Brisk and ripe, this Chard, from a cool region on San Luis Obispo, shows a classic profile of pure kiwi and lime fruit flavor. A layer of oak adds caramel, butterscotch and vanilla flavors. It all finishes in a long, spicy swirl of orange blossom honey.",Wolff Vineyard,88,18.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Mount Eden
132098,US,"Like many of Jess Jackson's high mountain Cabs, this is extremely tannic and dry, at least by Napa standards. So is it ageable? Probably, given the rich heart of blackberry, cherry, violet flower and coffee flavors. But it's a new brand, unproven. Give it until 2009, then try again.",,88,40.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pelton House
132099,US,"Open tonight and enjoy for its immediate pleasures. Soft and expressive, it shows a wealth of cherry, blackberry, raspberry, cola, licorice, cedar and vanilla-spice flavors that are wrapped into rich, finely ground tannins. Nice with a grilled steak.",Gregory Vineyard,88,36.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,VJB
132100,Argentina,"A good effort by Cavas Weinert. The wine is starting to mature, and along the road you get ripe berry aromas that broaden and improve with time. The plum, blackberry and red apple flavors are right, as is the tannin-to-acid balance. The only complaint is a mild chemical-paint thinner note at the base of the bouquet.",,88,23.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Weinert
132101,Austria,"Lively, perfumed, properly fresh and fruity as befits a juicy, ripe St. Laurent. There are no pretensions here, just pleasurable strawberry-and citrus-edged wine.",,88,15.0,Burgenland,,,St. Laurent,Zantho
132102,US,"A delicious Pinot, but not particularly complex. With direct, primary cherry marmalade and jellied mint flavors, accented with a bit of oak, it's dry and crisp. Drink now.",Durell Vineyard,87,45.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,De Loach
132103,Argentina,"Sweet plum, raisin and chocolate work the welcoming nose, and on the palate the wine is generous but easy to understand; the flavors are flush and ripe but none too complicated. Simply stated, this wine is healthy and well made.",Saurus Patagonia,87,9.0,Other,Neuquén,,Malbec,Familia Schroeder
132104,US,"From the knoll on the eastern side of the Silverado Trail known as Pritchard Hill comes this sophisticated Cab. With a softly gentle mouthfeel comprised of rich, sweetly ripe tannins, blackberry and blueberry fruit and oak, it finishes completely dry. Drink now.",Estate,87,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Girard
132105,US,"There's a minerality to this pleasantly dry Chard, a stony tang that dominates, although you'll find pineapple underpinnings. It's a leaner, more elegant style, and the winemaker has tried to enrich it with oak, sur lie aging and 50% malolactic fermentation.",Fiorella,87,36.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
132106,US,"This is a new, reserve-style wine from veteran Ferrari-Carano. It shows its cool-climate origins in the brisk acidity that boosts well-ripened pineapple tart, green apple sauce, and Key lime pie flavors. It's also extremely oaky, and would be a better wine if it had less barrel influence.",Tré Terre,87,36.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
132107,US,"I found the winery's regular '04 disappointing. This commemorative bottling is oakier and much riper in tropical fruit flavors, with non-malolactic crisp acidity and a buttercream texture. Somehow, though, it lacks the power and follow-through a great Chard should have, especially at this price.",30th Anniversary,87,73.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Grgich Hills
132108,US,"Lots of rich, ripe, forward fruit in this well-oaked wine, with tart green apple, pineapple, lime and kiwi flavors. It's stylishly dry, with a nice, creamy finish.",Sonoma Reserve,87,17.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Blackstone
132109,US,"Young and tight, this Zin shows the rustic, brawny nature of Zin's personality, with rugged tannins, peppery spices and a sweet-and-sour taste to the wild cherry, raspberry, pomegranate and rhubarb fruit. Will ride out the years, gradually softening and sweetening.",Redemption Zin,87,25.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Alexander Valley Vineyards
132110,US,"An easy, polished PG, with its flavorful burst of citrus, lemonflower, apricot, peach, fig, spice and vanilla flavors. Crisp and balanced, it makes you think of picnics, beach parties and warm summer nights.",,87,10.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Pinot Grigio,Stevenot
132111,Austria,"Dense, with rustic aromas, a little barnyard. The fruit is smooth in texture, touched by new wood and 14 months barrique aging. The tannins need time to settle down, with acidity shooting through the fruit.",Heideboden,87,24.0,Burgenland,,,Red Blend,Nittnaus Anita und Hans
132112,Austria,"This is Hans Nittnaus's international wine, with Cab Sauvignon and Merlot in the blend along with St. Laurent and Zweigelt. It offers complex flavors, mixing black fruits with smooth toast from barrique aging. There's a vegetal edge to it, which detracts from the overall impression.",Nit'ana,87,24.0,Burgenland,,,Red Blend,Nittnaus Hans und Christine
132113,Argentina,"The opening of floral and plum aromas is nice, and that's followed by some earth and heft. The palate is fleshy and tannic, with deep raspberry and plum flavors. The depth on this wine is pretty good, yet it finishes sort of short.",Reservado,87,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Viña Amalia
132114,US,"Tasted alongside the wonderfully rich '02, this Cab is leaner and more tannic. It shows an astringent lockdown, although there's some good blackberry-cherry fruit down below.

132115,Italy,"Now in its fourth generation, Tommasi is one of the most ardent ambassadors of Valpolicella wine tradition. And although the wines are always top notch, this particular vintage of Monte Masua seems to have suffered from the heat.

132116,Italy,"This is beautiful but so atypical, it's difficult to place within the wider range of Amarone styles.

132118,Italy,"This starts off a little funky and sweaty-smelling, but that blows off with some time to reveal a tropical, fruit-laden wine that's round in the mouth yet finishes with a refreshing burst of nectarine, mango and white pepper.

132119,US,"High alcohol makes this wine a little hot and sweet, and there may be some residual sugar, but it works in this Foothills Zin, of which this is a classic expression. With some rugged tannins and soft, low acidity, it shows expressive red and black berries, milk chocolate, root beer, gingerbread and peppery spices, with a sweet overlay of oak. Drink now.",,87,24.0,California,El Dorado County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,VJB

132121,Australia,"Clarendon Hills' “entry-level” Syrah comes from vines that are only 12 years old, but it is still a very good effort. The bouquet includes graham cracker, sour red plum and herbal notes, while the palate picks up some dusty, red-earth flavors. The finish is crisp. Minus the minerality, it's comparable to a good Crozes-Hermitage in a warm year.",Bakers Gully,89,65.0,South Australia,Clarendon,,Syrah,Clarendon Hills
132122,Spain,"This is the type of wine that's giving resurgent Jumilla a positive reputation. The nose is smoky but still loaded with solid fruit, while the palate bubbles over with pure blackberry and plum. It's a Monastrell-dominated blend, but it tastes a lot like Tempranillo, which is only 15% of the blend. Very nice overall.",Selección Roble,89,13.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Red Blend,Alceño
132123,US,"There's something exuberantly old-fashioned about this Pinot. It's dark, dry and tannicly rustic, with huge, gobby, fresh cherry pie flavors deep inside. Swan Pinots last for a long time; give this one five years to soften and melt those tannins.",Trenton Estate,89,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
132124,US,"Lots of upscale features in this polished Cab. It shows modern characteristics of expressively ripe, lush blackberry, blueberry, cassis and chocolate flavors that are wrapped in a soft, velvety texture. The softness may limit ageability.",,89,45.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Blue Rock
132125,US,"Lots to like in this Cab. Few regions do a better job of ripening red wines than Paso Robles while keeping prices modest. This one, from the hilly, limestony west side, is softly rich in blackberry and cherry flavors wrapped in fine, sweet tannins. This is a good price for a Cab of this quality.",,89,14.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Liberty School
132126,New Zealand,"Almost more of a white Graves style than a traditional New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, featuring a kiss of French oak and ample body without any overt pungency.

132127,Greece,"Xinomavro, meaning acid-black, is one of Greece's better indigenous reds and the only variety in Naoussa. It can make wines with firm acidity and jackhammer tannins, as in this example, which also shows a spicy nose of black pepper, coffee and red fruit. Flavors are a bit darker and sweeter, to match the heavy tannins, with black spicy fruit, coffee and a touch of chocolate.

Varietally, this wine exhibits freshly picked peach, apple, quince and butterscotch flavors that finish clean and dry.",,89,24.0,California,Arroyo Seco,Central Coast,Pinot Gris,La Rochelle
132129,US,"Seems like it was picked earlier than most '03s, given the dry tannins and peppery, minty flavors. Still, it has a beautiful structure, classic and refined, with cherry and cocoa flavors and upscale oak. Drink now through 2010.",Estate Bottled,89,55.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sullivan
132130,US,"Made in a less ripe style, with citrusy, herbal flavors that are well-oaked and leesy, this very dry Chard displays both elegance and a long finish. If you're into aging Chardonnays, try cellaring this through 2010. Should be fine.",Reserve,89,35.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Robert Mondavi
132131,US,"Soft and juicy, with extremely ripe fruit that's almost jammy, this 100% Cabernet is complex and interesting. It immediately flatters with upfront blackberry tea, a honeyed cherry liqueur taste and plenty of toasty oak, then pulls back and shows a deeper, earthier side. Drink now–2010.",Redgrav Vineyard,89,50.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Longboard
132132,US,"This refreshing wine has that extra something that pushes it to the next level. Shows deliciously ripe lime, lemon and sweet grass flavors that show little oak influence, letting the fruit and spice shine. Without malo, the wine is sprightly in mouth-cleansing acidity.",,89,24.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Longboard
132133,France,"A full, balanced wine with layers of grapefruit and a pure citrus streak. Secondary flavors of almonds and toast add complexity. This is not profound, but it is eminently enjoyable.",Brut,89,50.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Chartogne-Taillet
132134,New Zealand,"Craggy's Chardonnay is a big boy, with fully ripe fruit (14.5% alcohol) that's framed by ample oak. Yet it shows some restraint as well, with aromas of pencil shavings and minerals that nicely complement pear and melon fruit. With a richly textured, almost gravelly mouthfeel, the wine shows good depth and richness. The overall impression is of a wine that's a bit oaky now, but should integrate nicely in a another 12 months or so.",Les Beaux Cailloux Gimblett Gravels,89,60.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Chardonnay,Craggy Range
132135,US,"This is a huge Cabernet, very soft in the modern manner, and very ripe. It's a blast of cherry jam and milk chocolate, with plenty of toasty oak, and the tannins are firm and complex. Good now, it should hold well for the next ten years.",Endeavor,89,55.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dry Creek Vineyard
132136,US,"Dry, oaky and balanced, this Cab shows the grace and balance that come from really good terroir. It's superripe, flooding the mouth with rich Cabernet flavors of blackberries, cassis and chocolate, yet maintains harmony. Grown on the true Rutherford bench, west of Highway 29.",Morisoli Borges Vineyard,89,45.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Fountainhead
132137,US,"Lots of flash in this relatively inexpensive Chardonnay, which shares many of the qualities of far more expensive wines.

132138,US,"This is a good price for a wine of this pedigree. Shows classic Santa Maria Pinot notes of dusty, crushed brown spices, cherries and cola, with cool-climate acidity and a rich coat of tannins. This Pinot should drink well at least through 2010.",Grand Reserve Bien Nacido Vineyard,89,19.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Villa Mt. Eden
132139,US,"Nice Cab, a Rutherford-St. Helena blend that's tannic enough to warrant time in the cellar.

132140,New Zealand,"Not a stereotypical New World fruit-driven Pinot, this is a dark and stormy night—filled with earthy notes, tobacco, soy and root vegetables, with a wiry structure and firm finish that call Burgundy to mind. Drink 2007–2010.",,89,30.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Wild Earth
132141,Greece,"You could easily get lost in this wine's bouquet: plenty of new, spicy oak, scents of plum and blackberry pie, later picking up anise and coffee. On the palate, a streak of acidity is followed by soft, dry tannins, making way for more blackberry and anise. This wine has a lot of depth, and the firm tannins and solid acidity imply this could last for at least a decade, but it's very enjoyable now.",,89,22.0,Thessalikos,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Karipidis
132142,Australia,"A burly blend of 65% Shiraz and 35% Grenache, the 2005 Brave Faces is a big, chunky monster that's difficult to judge at this stage. It's closed and inexpressive on the nose, but it has enough body and black cherry fruit to warrant confidence, supported by the long, spice-tinged finish.",Brave Faces,89,36.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz-Grenache,Two Hands
132143,Spain,"A classic cava from top to bottom. The nose offers familiar baked apple, mineral and saline aromas, while the palate is exceedingly fresh in its delivery of pineapple, apple and nectarine flavors. A fruity yet crisp number that foams up nicely on the palate but doesn't lose its focus or form.",Aria Estate Brut,89,12.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
132144,US,"High in alcohol, with some heat throughout, but the wine wears it well, with huge fruit and a dry finish.

132145,Spain,"Black fruit, licorice and earth are all aromas of classic Montsant, and together they are easy to enjoy and understand.

132146,US,"I drank this at the end of a long, hot summer day, which is when a cold, crisp white is at its best. What a delicious wine. Bold citrus and apricot flavors, acids so strong they almost fizz and a rich creaminess even though there's no oak.",,89,19.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Voss
132147,Spain,"A touch heavy, but not nearly as weighty and syrupy as this winery's '03 Excelencia. At 14%, it's a bit raisiny and blustery, but the dark plum and coffee flavors do manage to please. And the finish is full of chocolate and fudge-like residue. Big but fun; ready to be drunk now.",El Albar,88,20.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,J. & F. Lurton
132148,Spain,"Keeps the Cordon Negro reputation healthy by delivering easygoing lemon-lime aromas and round citrus and apple flavors.

132152,US,"Fresh and leesy, this stainless steel-fermented Pinot Gris spent six months on the lees, giving it extra freshness and texture. Sweet grass and fresh herbs spread nicely across the palate, and the 15% alcohol does not register as such. In fact, if anything, this seems to fall on the lighter side of Oregon Pinot Gris, without the thick and heavy fresh cut pear character that many of them bring. Pair this with chanterelles in a light cream sauce.",,87,18.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris,Left Coast Cellars

132156,Australia,"An intriguing wine, this boasts herbal-, tobacco- and truffle-laced aromatics backed by a modicum of cassis fruit and a wonderfully soft, creamy, supple texture.

132157,US,"The gigantic flavors are there, showing the exotic, flamboyant side of Viognier. Peach, pineapple, kiwi, Key lime pie, honeysuckle blossom, roasted almond, smoky new oak and Asian spices lead to a dry, honeyed finish. There's an edgy awkwardness, though, that limits elegance. Might simply be too young. Best after mid-2008.",,87,42.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Viognier,Pride Mountain
132158,Italy,"Three native grapes – Inzolia, Catarratto and Grillo – create the blend and show the potential of warm climate, Sicilian whites.

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Siduri
132161,Spain,"Starts with aromas of clove, Band-Aid and other spicy aromas. It has a minor herbal essence both on the nose and palate, which is typical of Spanish Cabernet.

Features 15% Tempranillo; drink now.",Gran Coronas Reserva,87,20.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Torres
132162,Spain,"Borderline exotic on the nose, with aromas of black cherry, violet and a touch of earthy leather.

132164,Argentina,"Leather, charred oak and mineral carry the nose, which also offers some generic black-fruit aromas.

132165,Italy,"Fruity aromas of blackberry and red forest fruit take a back seat to penetrating oak-driven notes of cedar and vanilla, although the end result is not unbalanced.

132166,Italy,"I THINK THIS WINE WAS ALREADY PUBLISHED - SENT IT TWICE.   On top of pear, apple and acacia, the nose of this luminous white awards notes of wild flower, kiwi or cut grass. It delivers great vibrancy and is tight and tonic in the mouth.",,87,18.0,Southern Italy,Falerno del Massico,,Falanghina,Villa Matilde
132167,Australia,"In a lineup with other Coonawarra Cabs, this is a bit on the lean, tart side, lacking in fleshy opulence.

Pair this wine with red meat, especially lamb, and roasts.",Silenzi,87,,Sicily & Sardinia,Isola dei Nuraghi,,Red Blend,Pala
132171,US,"This is a Zin that needs a warmer vintage to really succeed, and 2005 was cool. It trades the richness of the ‘04 in favor of dried blackberry, tobacco, white pepper and herb flavors. The acid-tannin balance also is more notable. Quite good, but not great. Drink now.",Knotty Vines Estate,87,20.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rodney Strong
132172,US,"A barrel selection, the Suzanne's Reserve is more concentrated than its less expensive sibling (the Cali's Cuvée) but does not have as interesting a flavor set. Here you'll find the tangy cherry fruit is accompanied by sharp acids and chewy tannins. Although it is a 2004 the wine still seems wrapped up and refuses to let go.

132174,Argentina,"There's a sweet center to the bouquet, but surrounding it are more complex notes of mushroom, rubber and roast meat.

132175,Italy,"Cantine Colosi's interpretation of Passito di Pantelleria is definitely distinct and unique. Rather than mature apricot and honey notes, the golden-colored wine focuses on pungent aromas of roasted nut, root beer and powdery menthol candy. It comes together well, but in a very intense and powerful way that might not appeal to everyone. It has a chewy, viscous almost tannic feel in the mouth.",,87,35.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Passito di Pantelleria,,Zibibbo,Colosi
132176,US,"This is a solid effort, with good varietal character and definition. Half was fermented in stainless, half in neutral barrel, and the wine was given extended (130 days) lees contact. The herbal, peppery tang of the grape is clearly there, with intriguing hints of slate laced through the finish. This would be dynamite with sushi.",Elton Vineyard,87,21.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Grüner Veltliner,Daedalus
132177,Italy,"Alberto Longo is a rising star in the Puglia region and this fragrant Falanghina is a good example of his talent - especially considering that Puglia is primarily known for its reds. Aromas of exotic fruit, almond, Golden Delicious apple and pear are backed by thicker structure due to the region's sunny climate. Care has been taken to safeguard the variety's floral nuances and clean acidity.",Le Fossette,87,22.0,Southern Italy,Puglia,,Falanghina,Alberto Longo
132178,Italy,"Made with grapes from 50-year-old vines, this has a lush veneer of caramelized cherry lavished on top.

Drink now.",,87,26.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,White Oak
132180,South Africa,"KWV, the huge combine that once dominated the South African wine industry, has turned into a quality producer, and it shows in this fine wine. It has elegance and sophistication in the way it balances big flavors of spice and black plums with considerable restraint, and in the way the fruit is layered with dry Cabernet tannins. This needs some aging—three to four years would be good.",Cathedral Cellar,90,18.0,Coastal Region,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,KWV
132181,France,"A wine that is still young and still developing. It shows great raspberry fruit flavors, as well as black cherries. Has a delicate mineral character; this is going to be a fine, mature wine. For now, it is just delicious.",Brut Rosé,90,77.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Deutz
132182,US,"Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux blend shows a lovely structure, and ripe black currant and fruit, tarted up with toasty oak. It's dry and balanced and complex.

132184,Spain,"This winery's flagship red is Tempranillo-based and it delivers round, blackberry, herb, tobacco and earth-based aromas. It's fairly creamy in the mouth, with generous flavors that hit the berry and plum chords and the descent into a deep finish of vanilla, oak and herbs. Not a cookie-cutter red; doesn't taste run-of-the-mill. Good through 2011.",Gaudium Gran Vino,90,50.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Red Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
132185,Portugal,"It's mainly (80%) Alicante Bouschet with 10% each Syrah and Touriga Nacional, but this wine bears something of a resemblance to Port. Dark chocolate and blueberry notes show up on the nose, although there are also bright raspberry and vanilla flourishes. Long and a bit peppery on the finish, this is a winter-weight red to have alongside braised meats.",Reserva,90,38.0,Alentejano,,,Portuguese Red,Pontual
132186,US,"Although it's in the same style as the winery's '04 regular Pinot, this is far more sophisticated.

It is finely balanced, very pure.",Premier Cru Brut,90,63.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Pascal Doquet
132188,US,"Younger and a bit more raw than the '03, and the oak is sticking out more boldly, but this should be a fine bottle in much the same fashion as its predecessor in a year or so.

132189,France,"A blend of 60% Pinot Noir, 30% Chardonnay and 10% Pinot Meunier, this is a light, fresh wine, well developed already, with ripe fruit from a classic Champagne year. The acidity is already moving toward toastiness.",Brut,90,72.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Deutz
132190,Spain,"Big and charred, but under the veil of new oak there's violet, blackberry and savory spice notes. Full throttle on the palate, with quality plum and cherry flavors.

132191,Portugal,"This Symington family table wine program is going well, to judge by this excellent 2003 Reserva. It packs plenty of lush blackberry fruit into a creamy, medium-bodied wine with supple tannins.

132192,US,"The first of the highly anticipated '05s are starting to appear, and to judge from this wine, west side Paso Rhônes will be winners. The wine benefited from a cool vintage, allowing the Mourvèdre, Grenache and Counoise long hang time, yet avoiding overly ripe fruit.

132193,US,"The vineyard is in the warmer, northern valley. The cool, dry harvest permitted the grapes to achieve maximum ripeness, and this is a superfruity wine. No oak touched it, but it was stirred on the lees, which gives the citrus and tropical fruit flavors a rich, creamy texture. This is a polished, sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc.",Work Vineyard,90,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Work
132194,France,"A ripe, soft wine, one that's creamy on the palate. There is just a touch of caramel, but the main flavors are of crystallized lemons, pears and honey. This is delicious, fresh, and a great aperitif wine.",Blanc de Blancs Brut,90,74.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Louis Roederer
132195,South Africa,"At first smell this seems to be maturing fast, with cedar and pencil shaving aromas.

Not imported.",Estate,90,,Stellenbosch,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kaapzicht
132196,New Zealand,"After years of trying, Lynskey has finally broken through with her Marlborough Merlot. This year's version features a better balance of fruit to oak than the 2001, and better ripeness than the 2002.

132199,Portugal,"Don't let the medium  you—that's how this is supposed to look. Malmsey is the sweetest of the Madeiras, and this one is intensely sweet, yet also lemony-tart at the same time, with flavors of black walnuts, molasses and coffee.",5 year,90,21.0,Madeira,,,Malmsey,Cossart Gordon

132201,Portugal,"A terrific value, Casa da Alorna's 2003 Colheita Seleccionada is a darkly colored wine imbued with a round, lush mouthfeel and long, velvety finish.

132203,US,"With hefty acidity, this crisp, zesty wine is bone dry, as the label says. Made Alsatian-style, it has tart green apple, peach, floral and mineral flavors.

132208,US,"This full-bodied Pinot has classic Santa Maria character. It's fairly tannic, but very dry, with blue and black fruit and berry flavors veering into leather, overtones of violets, and masses of crushed spices, not to mention smoky oak.

132209,New Zealand,"One of New Zealand's most consistently good wineries, Peg Bay has turned in an excellent 2005 Chardonnay.

It's dark, deep and meaty with strong blackberry, black raspberry, plum, licorice, cured meat and spice flavors fleshing out the rich mouthfeel. Delicious spice and mocha appear on the long finish.

132216,US,"This is a cool-climate wine made in a good vintage.

132221,Spain,"Over a year ago this wine rated only 86, but bottle age has improved it, and now its condensed nose of black fruit and chocolate mint chip is very pleasing.

132381,France,"The other wine of Pouilly-sur-Loire (way behind Pouilly-Fumé in quantity) is this Chasselas grape-based wine, from a much older tradition.

132382,US,"Absolutely dry, this full-bodied red has coffee, cherryskin and dried herb flavors.

132383,US,"Jacaman's been doing a good job with their Russian River Pinot. This one's a bit off the pace of the '03, due to the hotter vintage that makes the wine riper and simpler. But it's still a flavorful, dry, silky wine, with a fair degree of complexity. Drink now.",,87,40.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J. Jacaman
132384,US,"A funny wine, maybe going through an awkward stage. It's pale, light-bodied, silky, acidic and bone dry, with cherry, orange zest, root beer, kid leather and vanilla spice flavors. Resembles a decent Barbaresco at a young age. Seems a bit simple now, but could develop bottle complexity over the next five years.",,87,24.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Nebbiolo,Mandolina

132386,US,"Always among the top Santa Barbara Merlots, the '04 is the ripest Gainey I've ever had. It's a burst of chocolate-covered raspberries and cherries, with a rich smoky veneer of sweet oak. If this were any sweeter on the palate, it would be flawed, but it has just enough tannins and acids to keep it balanced.",Limited Selection,87,35.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Merlot,Gainey

After 20 months in French oak, the fruit has taken on a dried character, ending on a cedary note. Drink now.  Imported by Tom Eddy Wines.",,87,35.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Juniper

132461,US,"With 6 Rhône varieties, including Viognier, this is a fresh, fruity wine meant to be consumed within the next five years. It's strong in cherry, blackberry and other berry flavors, with the smoky vanilla of oak.",Rhône Red Wine,87,40.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,Clos La Chance
132462,US,"Shows the lusty, rustic nature of Dry Creek Zins. There's an earthy, herbal component to the brambly blackberry and black raspberry fruit, with a sweet, spicy finish of olive tapenade and roasted figs. Great with sugar-based barbecue sauce on poultry or beef.",,87,35.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Vin Nostro
132463,US,"This wine shows the California influence, taking the edges off the Oregon fruit and pushing it forward on the palate. Broad flavors of strawberry jam and streaks of melon take over, with plenty of the root beer/cola character right behind. It could almost be Russian River juice, but shown in a lighter, more elegant style. Excellent value.",,87,19.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Siduri
132464,Australia,". Starts off nicely, with aromas of dark chocolate, cassis and mint. There's a lovely hint of vanilla to the flavors, and a cleanness and purity that's admirable. The wine also has rather tart, crisp acids, which accentuate the wine's tannins, giving it an astringent feel—a fine match for rare beef, but less enticing when served on its own.",Presidents Selection,87,19.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wolf Blass
132465,US,"Lots to like in this dry, fruity Chardonnay. It has flavors of tropical fruits, buttered toast and caramel, wrapped into a rich, creamy mouthfeel. But it's pretty acidic, if you're sensitive to prickliness in your wines.",,86,29.0,California,Bennett Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Frostwatch
132466,Spain,"Consistent with past vintages, this crianza gets it right without setting off any balloons. It starts with raspberry and cassis aromas and backs that up with slightly citrusy red-fruit flavors. Any rawness or heat on the palate will be tamed by matching it with meat, chorizo, ham, cheese, etc.",Crianza,86,25.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Alidis
132467,US,"This rather delicate Pinot comes on soft and slightly soapy, with interesting floral grace notes over simple fruit.

132468,US,"Tasted in October, this still-young Merlot is tannic and jammy. It shows fresh primary fruit flavors of raspberries, cherries and blackberries that are a bit one-dimensional. Give it until mid-2008 to develop some bottle complexity.",Reserve,86,25.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Kenwood

132470,Spain,"An oily, earthy wine with plenty of belt strap and dark fruit on the nose. The palate is a bit scattered, but there's ample mineral and blackberry to move it forward. The feel is choppy due to pronounced acidity, yet the finish is generally clean and fluid.",Clos les Fites Criança,86,29.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,La Perla del Priorat

132473,Spain,"Stocky and warm, with mild baked-fruit aromas and a hint of bramble. This venerable table wine is made from 65% Garnacha and 35 Cariñena, and from 2005 it's pretty much on the money. Expect earthy, mildly brambly flavors, lively acidity and soft tannins. Good for a wide range of simple foods and appetizers.",Sangre de Toro,86,10.0,Catalonia,Catalunya,,Red Blend,Torres
132474,Italy,"This is a hard wine to score. Thin in appearance and awkward on the nose with contrasting aromas of licorice, dill, coffee and red currant berry; it's not clear where it's going.

132475,Spain,"A holdover from 1999, this varietal single-vineyard Cabernet offers tree bark, molasses and prune on the nose, while the palate has raspberry flavors sitting front and center, with drying tannins in support. It's a woody and grabby wine, with vanilla notes toward the end. And at eight years old, it doesn't appear as though it will improve beyond where it's at now. So drink soon.",Vinya La Scala Gran Reserva,86,55.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pago Jean Leon
132476,Italy,"Who says a simple, no-fuss white can't speak of its terroir? This quaffable Sardinian wine, deeply redolent of dried sage, oregano, natural rubber and those funny cigarettes people smoked in the 1960s, speaks loads about the arid, brush-covered island it comes from. Those herbal notes set this wine up for a pairing with smoked salmon or swordfish.",Silenzi,86,,Sicily & Sardinia,Isola dei Nuraghi,,White Blend,Pala
132477,US,"There's a sharpness to this wine that edges out the cherry and raspberry flavors. Although it's dry and rich in oak, that sharp prickly feeling emphasizes the tannins, and takes away from total enjoyment. Drink now.",,86,60.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Pride Mountain
132478,Spain,"Slightly warmer in style, with caramel and vanilla aromas, yet the palate runs more toward freshness, with orange and pineapple standing out.

132479,US,"Firmly on the rustic side, this Zin is hot and peppery. It's also slightly sweet and sour, with spicy flavors of soy sauce, mashed cherries and blackberries, candied ginger, balsamic vinegar and tabasco. This controversial wine, which hails from a famous old vineyard, will have its fans.",Dusi Vineyard,86,33.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Four Vines
132480,US,"Right off the bat you can taste the acidity in this wine, which is brighter and crisper than, say, the winery's Russian River Pinot. The tartness lifts the black cherry, cherry and raspberry flavors, heightening their impact through the long, spicy finish. Still, it's a wine for early drinking.",,90,39.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem

132482,Uruguay,"They call it Special Barrel, and one sniff tells you that this is a Tannat raised in pricey French oak barrels. And that's not a criticism; the wine is toasty, with alluring charcoal and smoke aromas. The palate is up to it as well, as it exhibits bright, elevated dark-fruit flavors. Nicely balanced for the most part, with plenty of cassis, berry and plum character.",Special Barrel,89,50.0,Uruguay,,,Tannat,Bouza
132483,Portugal,"Reasonably lush but not unstructured, Cálem's 2000 vintage Port is a solid effort.

132487,Spain,"The bouquet delivers touches of graphite and rubber in front of traditional dried cherry and raspberry.

Drink now through 2010.",Gran Reserva,89,26.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Montecillo
132488,South Africa,"One of South Africa's best with Chenin, Bruwer Raats has hit another home run with this unwooded wine. It kicks off with perfumed citrus aromas, then lets fly with lively almond-tinged flavors of orange and peach. Vibrant in the mouth with beautifully matching acidity, this is a wine that calls for food, but can certainly be enjoyed alone.",Original,89,13.0,South Africa,,,Chenin Blanc,Raats Family

132490,Portugal,"A lovely single-quinta wine that can be drunk now and over the next 10-15 years, Ventozelo's 2000 is a supple, creamy-textured Port that features slightly briary herbal-floral accents to its dark berry flavors.

132492,Spain,"There's no shortage of barrel-driven hickory, coffee and chocolate on this modern-style Rioja, but there's also a spike of green on the nose and at the core of the flavor profile. Surrounding that is bright blackberry, amplified tannins and bursting acidity.

132493,South Africa,"Owned by the same team that makes the Ernie Els wines, the Guardian Peak winery concentrates mainly on Rhône grapes.

132494,US,"If you're used to Napa Cabs, this will come as a surprise. It's earthier, with dried cherry and herb flavors and lots of spices.

It's really interesting.",,89,33.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,East Valley

132496,France,"How soft and creamy this is! With its aromas of pears, its generous, open character and its flavors of ripe white fruits, this is what 1998 is all about. Drink now; it's delicious, but it won't age much longer.",Cuvée Royale,89,52.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Joseph Perrier
132497,US,"Delicious and quirky, this wine has a cherried richness and the weight of a fine Chinon, but the silky gentleness of a light, pleasant Beaujolais.

132498,Spain,"Open-cut oak, blackberry and chocolate are the opening shots in this plump, ripe, full-bodied red that is slightly tannic and chewy but impressive due to solid plum, cherry and vanilla flavors.

Weighty; this is definitely a food-friendly Champagne.",Cuvée Louis Eugène Blanc de Noirs Brut,89,56.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Pannier
132501,South Africa,"A very herbal wine, with sage and thyme flavors. There are solid, dry tannins that mask the black fruits and red berry tastes.

132502,South Africa,"Matured in 100% new French oak, and it shows on the palate with tight wood tannins. This concentrated wine shows a dense, dark, brooding power from the estate's oldest block of Cabernet vines. The tannins at the end are dry, and the wine deserves another four or five years to mature.",Reserve,89,45.0,Stellenbosch,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Morgenhof

132504,South Africa,"There's a touch of austerity to this wine, a firm set of tannins and some herbal character, all coming from the high-altitude (3,000-foot) vineyards of Cederberg. These suggest aging potential, because the fruit is there as well as a range of berry flavors to go with the dryness.",,89,28.0,Cederberg,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cederberg
132505,France,"Toasty aromas are the first hints that this is now a mature wine. Its layers of acidity mingle with toast, walnuts and rich, mature fruit.

132506,France,"If a Faiveley Burgundy could ever be accused of having a slightly New World style, this would be the one.

Drink now–2010.",Domaine de la Croix Jacquelet,89,21.0,Burgundy,Montagny,,Chardonnay,Faiveley
132507,US,"Older oak barrel aging as well as stirring on the lees bring softness and creaminess to this fresh, clean wine.

132508,South Africa,"From the historic Constantia Valley comes this beautiful blend of Sémillon, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Muscat. Broad aromas of peachy tropical fruit are brushed with grass and toast notes that add complexity, leading to a round, medium-bodied wine that is sculpted with a dry, grassy feel.

132509,South Africa,"Rich and silky, this wine is full of very soft, sweet fruit. It has the texture of treacle, dense but without any sense of tannins. The dusty, superripe fruit (14.5% alcohol) makes it very enticing, but the structure and the acidity seem to have disappeared. Not imported.",L'Avenir Grand Vin Pinotage,89,,Stellenbosch,,,Pinotage,Laroche
132510,US,"A fine young Cab and a worthy followup to the 2004. Dry and tannic, it shows lush, complex flavors of black currants, mocha and cedar, with an herbaceous quality suggesting green olives.

132511,US,"A lovely Pinot Noir, showing flamboyantly ripe cherry, raspberry and chocolate-cola fruit, spiced with cinnamon and anise and enhanced with smoky oak.

132512,US,"Marked by crisp, coastal acidity, this Pinot has a lightly silky texture, but the flavors are quite concentrated.

132513,Argentina,"Much better and way more complex than your average Torrontés.

132514,US,"The Camille is a Merlot-centric Bordeaux blend, dense, liquorous, smoky, and loaded with chocolaty goodness—a truffle in a bottle.

132515,Portugal,"Garrafeira in Portugal means a special selection, and this wine, from low yielding vines, has an impressive concentration.

132518,US,"Very ripe and fruity-spicy, almost like a Zinfandel except for the silkiness, this Pinot shows flavors of black cherry pie filling, red currants and pomegranates, with earthier notes of cola and sweet tobacco.

132522,US,"The outstanding Elerding vineyard provided the fruit in 2006.

132523,US,"A lovely bottle, loaded with textures of moist earth and herb.

132524,US,"Powerful, herbal, tangy and spicy; this needs some time to mellow, but it's extremely flavorful, punchy and full of flavor.

132525,US,"This is a pure Cab Franc, stylish and varietal. The new oak was limited to just 30%, giving a kick to the natural toastiness of the grape. The fruit mixes blueberries, black cherry and a streak of cassis, then runs into luscious mocha and espresso, with highlights of black pepper and cedar. The tannins have been beautifully managed.",,90,32.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Franc,Hard Row To Hoe
132526,US,"Very rich and full-bodied, very voluptuous, this soft wine shows massive tiers of well-ripened black currant, plum sauce, mocha and cedar flavors.

132527,Italy,"There's a soft, creamy quality to this Sauvignon (with 10% barrel-fermented Picolit added to the blend) that recalls aromas of peach, passion fruit and papaya. There's excellent depth and density here and the wine is generous and chewy in the mouth.

132528,US,"This stylish Cab is loaded with black olive and black fruits, all with a leafy edge. Still young, tannic and a bit hard, it has good, clean varietal character and good length.

132530,US,"This belongs up there with Walla Walla's best Sangioveses (Leonetti, Walla Walla Vintners).

132531,US,"If you're a Petite Sirah fan you'll love the richness and power of this one, from an appellation in Lake County.

132533,US,"Tastes immature now, with the toasty oak not yet integrated, and the tannins also stick out in all their sticky glory.

Better sometime after mid-2010.",,90,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Phelan Vineyard
132534,Spain,"Full and boisterous red wine, with a ton of natural ripeness and a high pleasure quotient. We have always liked the Abadal wines, and this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend gets both sides of the Old World/New World argument right. It's loaded with dark berry and earth aromas, which are followed by cola, blackberry and chocolate flavors. An alert, acid-driven wine with enough depth to impress.",Abadal Crianza,90,17.0,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Masies d'Avinyo
132535,Australia,"In an unusual twist, Yalumba's m/g/s gives Mourvèdre preeminence in the blend (60%), followed by 22% Grenache and 18% Shiraz. The result is a wine that lightens some of Mourvèdre's dark fruit and tree-bark tendencies with a dash of raspberries. The wine's alcohol level is restrained (13.5%), while still being ripe and round in the mouth yet finishing with some grip. Should age well, but there's no need.",Hand Picked m/g/s,90,30.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Yalumba
132536,Argentina,"Immediately this one shines. The nose offers deep bacon, crusty mineral and hefty, perfectly ripe dark-fruit aromas. Balance is key to the wine's success, with beefy, sweet flavors of black plum offset by some fire and proper acidity. Peppery on the finish, with an overall warm, ripe, toasty personality. Ready to drink now.",Corte B,90,27.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Vistalba
132537,US,"This is essentially a mirror image of the 2004 Donedei Merlot. It brings the same dark, smoky, espresso-loaded scents and flavors, but it is sleeker, the acid more apparent (though actually a bit lower) and the tannins left to hang in the finish. This is a fine companion to the Merlot, but needs a juicy steak or rich sauce to cut the tannins.",,90,40.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Donedei
132538,Germany,"At 9.5% alcohol and with plenty of residual sugar, this is rather broad, but it still boasts excellent intensity and complexity. Aromas of wet slate speak to the wine's origins, mixing easily with hints of clover leaf, apple, melon and lime.

132715,US,"Powerful scents mix dried herb, wet grass and petrol—it could be mistaken for Sauvignon Blanc in a blind tasting, and it has that much density and extract. The label says dry, and it is certainly that, much in the Australian style. Big, concentrated, high acid and quite cellarworthy.",Dry,91,20.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Riesling,Amity Vineyards
132716,Spain,"Serious, stately Rioja with key aromas of prune, blackberry and leather. Snappy enough on the palate, with plenty of pop as well as pure berry flavors, smooth tannins, zest and dry vanilla. Some might call it a bit acidic and traditional, but with food it'll do great. Drink now through 2016. Only 250 cases made.",El Belisario,91,80.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Agrícola Labastida
132717,Germany,"Serious and earthy, like walking into a wall of minerality. The fruit takes a back seat here, but is lusciously peachy and fresh while the long finish is sparked by hints of exotic spices. Give this two to three years to show its best.",Graacher Himmelreich Spätlese,91,,Mosel,,,Riesling,Joh. Jos. Prüm
132718,Italy,"Ca' del Bosco is one of Italy's best producers of sparkling wine and this Brut expression show the deft hands of the staff winemakers. The wine is bright and light, but elegant and enduring at the same time. You'll get honeysuckle, stone fruit and yellow roses.",Brut,91,,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,Ca' del Bosco
132719,Italy,Here's a sophisticated and spicy sparkling wine from the 2004 vintage that boasts a clean and tonic delivery across the palate. You could easily pair this silky wine with fish or white meat thanks to the incredibly smooth and soft impression it leaves.,Satèn,91,,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,Ca' del Bosco
132720,US,"This is the best of the winery's current red releases. A blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, it's ripely sweet in blackberry pie filling and mocha flavors, and while it's soft in acids, the tannins are pretty and polished. Try with grilled steak and a rich, wine-infused mushroom sauce.",La Storia Cuvée 32 Red Wine,88,32.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Trentadue
132721,Spain,"Patience is a must to make it through this burly, earthy, almost murky blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon. Early aromas of mulch and coffee morph into black fruit and leather, while initially reduced black cherry and currant flavors take on more character and depth with time. Never does it really shine, but it is a serious wine that has its merits.",Cuvée Palomar,88,48.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Abadia Retuerta
132722,US,"Here's a well-behaved Pinot Noir. It's textbook coastal, a delicately structured, silky, high-acid wine with cola, cherry, root beer, rhubarb and rosehip tea flavors. Really delivers the goods at a fair price for the quality.",Block 7,88,20.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Lockwood
132723,Spain,"One of my personal favorites among the giant collection of Freixenet cavas is the extra dry, which isn't dry in the least. Just the opposite, it's loaded with sweet apple and apricot aromas along with peach, melon and candied citrus flavors. Best of all, it maintains its poise while never falling toward cloying or sappy.",Cordon Negro Extra Dry,88,10.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
132724,France,"Not many sparklers have anise aromas to match white stone fruits, but this 100% Chenin Blanc has just that, and more. Crisp and lively with citrus fruits flavors, especially lemon and lime, the wine has firm mineral and some stemmy notes to add character.  Goes to show you can still find good French sparklers for bargain prices.",Ph. Perdriaux Brut,88,12.0,Loire Valley,Vouvray,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine de Vaugondy
132725,Italy,"This is a well-balanced and pretty sparkling wine made from Pinot Noir grapes with brilliant amber reflections and notes of mature pineapple, toasted nut and melon. It's frothy and creamy in the mouth with refreshing crispness on the close. The wine ages three years in the bottle on the lees.",Metodo Classico,88,37.0,Piedmont,Piedmont,,Pinot Nero,Castello di Neive
132726,Cyprus,"A surprise from this region of Cyprus, this is a fully modern, smooth effort. The nose is a bit rambunctious, and the wine needs time to knit together, but it has good tannic structure and nicely integrated oak that offers cola flavors and aromas of vanilla, tobacco and spice to accompany the sweet blackberry and cherry flavors. The finish is long and mouthwatering.",Oak Aged,88,22.0,Pitsilia Mountains,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tsiakkas
132727,Spain,"Robust and dark, with plum and berry aromas that also carry hints of citrus and mineral. Overall this is a balanced specimen; the palate is round and full of bright plum and berry while the feel is moderately deep, somewhat tannic, and medium in acidity. Drink now.",Crianza,88,17.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto del Pais,Valdrinal

132729,New Zealand,"This may be atypically dark and powerful, but this wine provides a rich, satisfying drink that hopefully presages more good things to come from the 2005 vintage Pinots. Despite its inky color and plum and chocolate flavors, the texture is still very Pinot—silky and round but not flabby, with crispness and lift on the finish.",,88,18.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Sherwood Estate
132730,US,"Great price for a wine of this complexity and satisfaction. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with a wealth of lemon, lime and grapefruit citrus flavors and richer notes of peach pie and yellow apricot purée. Almost seems underpriced for what you get.",Reserve,88,20.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Mosaic
132731,New Zealand,"A good value for fans of the style, Saint Clair's 2006 Sauvignon Blanc continues this winery's leaning toward bell pepper and passion fruit aromas buoyed by bold, flashy tropical fruit flavors. Round and soft in the mouth, but shows good persistence on the finish.",,88,16.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Saint Clair
132732,Spain,"A bit lighter on the nose than many, with notes of raspberry and strawberry. That same character works its way onto the palate, where raspberry and plum flavors are front and center. Fruity and balanced, with a ripe, easy-to-like personality.",,88,17.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Mas Dels Frares
132733,Spain,"Hard spices, smoke and tar darken up the berry nose, while the palate is round and solid, with nice berry and plum fruit.

132734,Argentina,"Inky black in color, with a pretty nose defined by toast, minerality, stout plum and berry fruit. Round and vigorous in the mouth, with vibrant dark-berry flavors. A muscled-up wine from Salta with just enough finesse to balance everything out. Ready to drink.",Don David Reserve,88,15.0,Other,Cafayate,,Malbec,Michel Torino
132735,US,"Easy to ripen, hard to achieve balance and elegance. That's Viognier, and Iron Horse does one of the better jobs. That's because in addition to tropical fruit, citrus, flower and spicy flavors, the wine is very dry and acidic. In this case there's a bit of oak but just enough to add a touch of cream.",T-bar-T,87,24.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Iron Horse
132736,Italy,"Light lemon-lime and slight mineral aromas lead to standard apple, lime and orange-zest flavors.

132737,US,"The big acidity on this wine and the citrus fruit flavors make it kind of austere and minerally. But partial new oak and sur lie aging add some richness. This is a very dry, elegant, structural Chard meant for food. Try with a firm white fish topped with a fruity salsa.",Handley Vineyard,87,19.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Handley
132738,Spain,"Dark in color, with brawny aromas of oak, clove and leather. In the mouth, there's a mix of black plum and cherry but also a streak of bell pepper.

132739,US,"This wine is very fresh at three-plus years. It's lightly structured, with an elegant, silky mouthfeel and flavors of cola, red cherries, peppery spices and oak.

132740,Spain,"Bulky and a bit stewy, but still balanced enough to earn its positive points. The palate is ripe and sweet, as it oozes with black fruit. Some might call it a touch chunky, but for the most part this blend of Monastrell, Tempranillo and Syrah registers as a highly pleasurable red.",Tinto,87,10.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Red Blend,Alceño

132744,Italy,"Instead of obvious fruit aromas, this extra dry sparker delivers graham cracker, nicely chiseled mineral tones, plus kiwi and stone fruit in smaller doses.

132745,US,"This is a fancy Sauvignon Blanc. The underlying wine is cool-climate balanced, with ripe, very dry fig, citrus, green melon and paprika-spice flavors backed up with firm acids. On top of that is a layer of sweet, smoky oak and the creamy smoothness of sur lies aging.",,87,25.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Star Lane Vineyard

132747,Australia,"Ultrasmooth, this is an easy-drinking rendition of Aussie Grenache that's not swamped by new oak. There's some vanilla, but it simply serves to support the red cherry and currant aromas and flavors. Hints of dill and mint keep it from being too confected, as does a mouthwatering tartness on the finish. Drink now.",III Associates Three Score & 10,87,20.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Grenache,McLaren Vale Premium Wines

132750,US,"This is a pretty wine, and the initial flavors are soft and mature, suggesting a wine that's ready to drink now. In the mouth it falls away quickly with a slightly oxidized character that suggests an early fade is on the way. It's gentle and drinks well enough right now, with some barrel notes of caramel and coffee beefing up the finish.",Nicholas Estate,86,30.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Anam Cara
132751,US,"Zinfandels from the large Clockspring vineyard are made by a variety of wineries, and they vary in quality.

The tannins are intricate, with a jalapeño pepper finish.",,86,9.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Clockspring

132757,Australia,"A pleasant surprise, this bargain-priced offering shows much greater-than-expected varietal character.

132758,Italy,"The 17% alcohol is a bit frightening but this wine does a reasonably good job of absorbing the heat by contrasting it with strawberry preserves, moist earth, raspberry roll-up and nutty aromas (no wood is used). It does, however, boast enormous intensity in the mouth, with sweet fruit flavors. It's an “intellectual-meditation” wine, that won't appeal to everyone.",Badde Nigolosu Tenores,86,80.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Romangia,,Cannonau,Tenute Dettori

132761,US,"An exotic bouquet suggests dried roses, brown sugar, cranberry and plum jam. There's a sweetness in the mouth that continues the impression of brown sugar, or maybe a streak of cola. It's an interesting bottle that could develop further or fall off a cliff; it turns a little funky in the finish. More than 12,000 cases were made.",Premier Cuvée,86,37.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Archery Summit
132762,US,"This is the least of Brookdale's Cabs since the 2000 vintage, mainly because it's overly soft, with a baked, raisiny taste to the blackberries and cherries. Not an ager, so drink now.",,86,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Brookdale Vineyards
132763,Spain,"In accordance to what 2003 dealt out, this wine is a bit stewy and broad. It shows cola, tree bark and baked fruit on the nose, and then sweet plum and chocolate on the finish.

132764,US,"This stainless-steel fermented wine, from several different Willamette Valley vineyards, reaches a surprising 15.5% alcohol, and tastes like it. There is a sharpness to the flavors that, despite the wine's being somewhat chilled, comes across as alcoholic heat.

132765,US,"Here's a classic example of why Americans are buying Pinot Grigio.

132766,US,"Think of this as Baby Sineann; Peter Rosback made this light and pretty Pinot for vineyard owner Bob Morus. It's an Oregon Beaujolais, from young vines and using no new oak.

132767,Argentina,"Dark and fiery, with grapy, heavily extracted aromas. Compared to the winery's Premium Cabernet, this is harder and more choppy, with staggering tannins and heat on the finish.

132768,Australia,"This is a perfectly fine example of Clare Valley Cabernet, one that emphasizes refinement and elegance over sheer power and intensity.

Should hold well through 2015.",,86,37.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pearson Vineyards
132769,Spain,A better effort than in previous years. This vintage has a tangy personality and no tricks up its sleeve.

132770,Australia,"This wine is a bit hard and ungenerous but certainly not lacking in concentration or intensity. Cassis and cedar scents give way to dark, chocolaty flavors.

132771,Spain,"Early on the wine is dominated by buttery oak, and it's all over the nose, palate and finish.

132779,Spain,"This Garnacha- and Carignan-based wine offers a brilliant color and a true bouquet of graphite, mineral, char and black fruit. Thus expectations are high as you head to the palate, which turns out to be sheer, acidic and hard. Amid the scour you'll pull out plum and blackberry flavors.

132786,New Zealand,"Te Awa's Bordeaux-style red is a blend of 68% Merlot and 16% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc.

132789,Spain,"Wines like this are good indicators that 2004 is indeed an exceptional vintage in RdD. For a Tempranillo that spent only five months in oak it's fairly settled.

132797,US,"Earthier than Foley's Clone 2A Pinot, with rich mushroom and soy notes underneath the coffee and sweet red cherry flavors, this is a dry wine, with good acidity to balance out all that fruit. It's a little raw and juicy now, a young wine that needs some bottle time to pull itself together. Best 2007 through 2010.",Rancho Santa Rosa Pommard Clone,89,45.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Foley
132798,Spain,"Ripe and round, with blackberry and bacon aromas. Quite modern and full for a 2002, one of Rioja's most challenging vintages in a while. Shows full berry flavors with ample oak and a touch of tannin. Finishes with mocha and spice.",Selección,89,40.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Alabanza
132799,New Zealand,"Frost trimmed the yields in 2005, seemingly adding an extra layer of concentration to this wine. While still not a heavyweight, it's a lush, layered wine with slightly meaty nuances to its plum and cola flavors. Good length on the finish.",,89,17.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Kim Crawford
132800,US,"Opens with a blast of leather and animal scents, followed by brilliant raspberries and cherries, and then the sweet, spicy oak kicks in. What a sequence. The followup is rich and opulent. A bit on the soft side, but this is a really likeable Syrah.",Edna Ranch,89,32.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Kynsi
132801,South Africa,"Whole-berry fermentation in open-top fermenters allows fermentation to take place slowly and gently.

132802,France,"This small cooperative, based in Mardeuil, always seems to punch above its station, thanks to good quality fruit.

Not available in the U.S.",Fleur de Rosé,89,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Beaumont des Crayères
132803,US,"Here's a fine, distinctive Chardonnay. It possesses classic Edna acidity and forward citrus and mineral flavors, with a luscious interweaving of honeysuckle. The wine is thoroughly dry and quite delicious.",Edna Ranch,89,22.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Alapay
132804,Portugal,"Deliciously spicy and citrusy, this blend of Arinto, Rabo de Ovelha and Roupiero is quickly becoming one of Portugal's go-to whites. Pepper and ginger notes lead the way, backed by fresh pineapple fruit. A slightly oily mouthfeel gives it some heft, but the finish is spice-driven and refreshing, not heavy. Drink now.",Marquês de Borba,89,13.0,Alentejo,,,Portuguese White,J. Portugal Ramos
132805,France,"The name means “timeless”, and this wine is a definite apéritif wine, maybe for when time matters little.

132807,Spain,"LAN's modern interpretation of Rioja is ripe, fragrant and beefy, with mineral, charcoal, pine and black cherry coating the unctuous nose. Runs a touch soft and plump on the palate, probably a reflection of the hot '03 vintage. But along the way there's black plum, licorice, molasses and maple flavors. A big, new-wave wine that has a lot going for it.",Edición Limitada,89,45.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas LAN
132808,South Africa,"A single-vineyard wine from land high in the dramatic Jonkershoek valley, this is an intriguingly perfumed wine that still shows a fine sense of structure. The fruit is certainly ripe—it is 14.5% alcohol—but that is lost in the balance with acidity and fine black currant flavors.",Condé,89,42.0,Stellenbosch,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stark-Condé
132809,South Africa,"A perfumed, jammy wine, full of flavor. There is also a more serious element to this wine from the Hall's first vintage in their own winery. The tannin dryness, ripe wood flavors and cassis flavors suggest good aging, as well as good food pairing.",,89,44.0,Stellenbosch,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rudera
132810,US,"This 50/50 blend of old vine fruit from these two excellent vineyards is a bit overpowered by the massive amount of new oak flavor. The fruit may be a little more delicate than the barrels. Still a fine wine, loaded with cassis and blackberry fruit among the more substantial flavors of earth and tannin. The herbal character of the grape is preserved, adding black olive and coffee to a finish that shows some heat.",GV Reserve ‘Gamache – Champoux Vineyard Select',90,40.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gamache
132811,US,"This Cab-dominated blend shows good concentration. Supple blue and black fruits are wrapped into a core of iron and lead pencil.

132812,France,"A refined and complex Syrah from the “Grand Cru” of Minervois la Liviniere. Raspberry, blueberry, rosemary and thin mint flesh out the velvety texture, supported by a solid backbone of gripping tannins and balanced acidity. Coffee and cocoa notes develop on the lush, lingering finish.",Old Vine,90,46.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Minervois La Liviniere,,Syrah,Château Maris
132813,US,"A bit sharp, but saved by lush flavors of currants, mashed cherries and blackberries, and a drizzle of anisette, chocolate, black pepper and vanilla. The tartness could well age out, but a fine steak or cut of lamb will help to soften and balance.",,90,75.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Crescendo
132814,US,"A dense, balanced Syrah that amply displays a complex mix of ripe fruits, hinting at raisins and spice, but not overloaded with either. The spice-cake impression continues on, adding layers of coffee and toast, then introducing moist earth and a bit of dried herb.",The Dark Side,90,25.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Darby
132815,US,"Feels a bit heavy now, with direct flavors, like cherry and chocolate cream pie filling without the crust. However, there are suggestions that aging will benefit. The tannins are thick, and the acidity is good enough to carry the wine through some evolution. Try after 2011.",Longbow,90,48.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
132816,Argentina,"Clos de los Siete, the amalgmated product of Michel Rolland's Uco Valley wine commune, is rich, round and ripe, with deep aromas and trimmings like polished oak and minerality.

No hiccups, pure fruit and complexity make this stellar for the price.",,90,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Clos de los Siete
132817,Spain,"Ripe, dark, a little oily and totally compelling from an aromatic standpoint. The palate is right where it should be, as neither the tannins nor the acidity are out of whack. Boysenberry, blackberry and plum flavors carry an herbal touch, and the finish is layered, with a lasting impression of coffee.",Reserva,90,32.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Conde de Siruela
132818,US,"Very spicy, with an intense bouquet of toast, seed and pungent herb. Rich and fruity in the mouth, it's a complex mix of melon, passion fruit, papaya, guava and sweet orange. The fruit salad rolls back into oaky, buttery flavors for a full-throttle finish. Another 15.5% effort from Airfield, but here the fruit can stand up to the barrels.",Lightning,90,20.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Chardonnay-Viognier,Airfield Estates
132819,Argentina,"Basso's premium blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah and Merlot is an example of good fruit meeting good winemaking. With leather and brick dust accenting black-fruit aromas, the bouquet is positive. And the flavors of plum, blackberry, soy sauce and cola are very nice. A breakout wine for this winery.",,90,29.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Red Blend,Carlos Basso
132820,US,"The newest Ursa is 50% Merlot, 24% Cab Franc, 17% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot, and it is absolutely delicious right out of the chute; no breathing needed.

Good persistence and length.",Ursa,90,39.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Baer

132822,Australia,"This rather full-bodied offering from Leeuwin features some striking blueberry fruit, accompanied by notes of toast, vanilla and cedar. The result is a pleasant yin-yang of fruit and oak that likely just needs some time to develop more complexity. Try in 2012.",Art Series,90,35.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Shiraz,Leeuwin Estate
132823,Italy,"We are extremely pleased with this vintage of Confini. The wine (a blend of Pinot Grigio, Traminer and Riesling) offers enormous aromatic intensity with layers of passion fruit, peach and citrus. Yet, this wine does not play all its cards on the nose. The texture it imparts in the mouth is smooth, creamy, rich and decadent overall.",Confini,90,45.0,Northeastern Italy,Venezia Giulia,,White Blend,Lis Neris

132827,Australia,"This soft, creamy-textured Shiraz features slightly lifted and peppery aromas and a suggestion of mint, then subdued flavors of cola, olive, earth and spice. It could use more obvious, expressive fruit, but there's no doubt this delicious wine shows complexity and elegance to spare. Drink now–2015.",,90,30.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Murray Street
132828,Portugal,"Coming from the Alvarinho region of Monção in the far north of Portugal, this is a rich wine, its creamy apple character brought out beautifully by its tight, steely edge. This has style, ripe fruit, a green plum skin edge to it, finished with vibrant acidity.",Portal do Fidalgo,90,16.0,Vinho Verde,,,Alvarinho,Provam
132829,Portugal,"A blend of Alvarinho and Trajadura, this is relatively full-bodied Vinho Verde. The creamy texture is the most apparent, always freshened with lively citric acidity, a very light prickle on the mouth. The wine is fragrant and crisp. Drink this summer, but also possible to age.",Varanda do Conde,90,12.0,Vinho Verde,,,Portuguese White,Provam
132830,US,"A terrific Chardonnay. You won't miss the oak at all. Offers a wealth of pineapple pie, Meyer lemon sorbet, green apple jam and vanilla flavors, brightened by clean, crisp coastal acidity.

132831,US,"What a great Syrah for twenty bucks. It's as dry, full-bodied and peppery as a fine Northern Rhône bottling, with impressively deep flavors of sour black cherries, plums, violets and cedar. An outstandingly good buy, but only 174 cases produced.",Wolff Vineyards,90,20.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,TreViti
132832,Australia,"Vasse Felix's 2005 Shiraz offers up a powerful, pungent blend of stewed fruit, cedar and dried spices, resulting in a wine that impresses more for its power and intensity than its elegance. It's the right match now with a grilled steak, but should mellow and become more civilized by 2012.",,90,30.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Shiraz,Vasse Felix
132833,US,"This may be the only Oakville-appellated Sangiovese, and it's quite a good wine. Dry and crisp in the acidity the variety always shows, it has flavors of ripe crushed red cherries, spiced with black pepper and enriched with sweet, smoky oak, and wrapped into a silky texture. An elegant wine to have with roasts.",Penny Lane Vineyard,90,32.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Sangiovese,Venge
132834,Argentina,"One of the best $15 red blends being made today. Carrascal gives us 45% Malbec, 35% Merlot and 20% Cabernet in rock-solid form. The nose has toast, mineral, balsam wood and good berry fruit, and the palate provides the troika of cherry, raspberry and plum with no interference or oaky gimmicks. Pleasant, warm and long on the finish.",Carrascal,90,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Weinert
132835,US,"This has appealing earthiness, and it's slightly chalky, with chocolaty tannins. Very dry red fruits suggest raspberry, pomegranate and cranberry. The chocolate flavors continue to evolve, somewhat masking the green hints in the tannins. Nicely made, with the softness of well-tanned (Corinthian?) leather.",Phinny Hill Vineyard,90,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Carmenère,Tertulia
132836,US,"This is a big, oaky, creamy Chardonnay, but it retains the crisp acidity and overall control to be balanced and even elegant despite its size. Shows potent flavors of pineapple-infused crème brûlée, butterscotch and vanilla custard. Drink now.",Winemaker's Reserve,90,30.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Souverain
132837,Spain,"Purple in color and meaty on the nose, with a hint of raisin and reduction but not too much. Due to the heat of 2003, this is a ripe, rich wine with big plum and berry flavors but also good balance and feel. It covers all the bases and finishes in a smooth, solid, stylish way. Just reaches the cut of excellence.",Fincas de Ganuza Reserva,90,51.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Remírez de Ganuza
132838,US,"Bright and zesty, with flavors of limes, kiwi fruit, green apples and pineapples, accompanied by crisp acidity. Could almost be an Edna Valley Chardonnay. Oak plays only a supporting role.",,90,30.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Jordan
132839,Portugal,"A rich wine, spiced with wood, tannins and sweet, ripe, black plums. The tannins give a granite, mineral edge of dryness, a core of strength in this impressive, structured wine. Wait another year for the black fruits to show through even more strongly.",,90,,Dão,,,Portuguese Red,Alvaro Castro
132840,France,"A mature, toasty wine, perhaps too toasty. There are still hints of ripe strawberries as well as the more mature flavors. The wine shows a full-bodied character and an attractive onion skin color.",Diamant Rosé Brut,86,160.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Vranken
132841,US,"Lots to like in this four-year-old Merlot. It's fully dry and not too fruity, with rich blackberry, sage, anise and oak flavors that are complex and long. On the minus side, the wine is too soft, lacking the vital acidity and tannins needed for structure.",,86,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Twomey
132842,Italy,"There are only a few pockets of vineyard land in Italy with the correct levels of fog or moisture for noble rot (botrytis) and the Marche is one of them. But 2003 was a sweltering hot year and as a result this Sauvignon-based dessert wine lacks its characteristic intensity. You do get apricot, peach and honey over the wine's lean consistency and there's a slightly sour taste on the finish.",Maximo Botrytis Cinerea,86,30.0,Central Italy,Marche,,Sauvignon Blanc,Umani Ronchi
132843,Argentina,"Sweet aromas that verge on syrupy set up a sweet and easy palate of black cherry and cassis. This has a nice texture as it shows good body, feel and fruit quality. Maipe means “lord of the winds” in a native language, and while this Malbec won't transport you anywhere, it's good for the price.",,86,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Maipe
132844,Italy,"With its pretty medley of honey and peach aromas and a crystalline appearance, this is a quintessential Italian Pinot Grigio.

132845,US,"Mer Soleil Chards seem to get bigger, riper and oakier every year. Of course, this is the winery's style, and when it works, the results can be fabulously rich, but this caramelized wine seems a little top-heavy.",,86,42.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Mer Soleil
132846,Italy,"Although you might encounter some initial sulfur, this wine later portrays yellow rose, peach, almond, cut grass and honey. It doesn't have huge flavor intensity but just enough to keep your attention.",,86,37.0,Northeastern Italy,Collio,,Tocai Friulano,Mario Schiopetto
132847,US,"Here is an interesting take on Viognier, relatively low in alcohol (13%) but quite sweet, at almost 2% residual sugar. The sweetness takes away a fair amount of the interesting citrus character of the grape, and seems to dumb it down a bit, but it might fit in well with spicy Asian dishes.",,86,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Viognier,Maryhill
132848,France,"A lively Champagne, initially all froth and fizz. But get through that and there is a pleasant, slightly sweet wine— perhaps more full-bodied than some. The primary red-fruit flavors have been lessened by some bottle age, leaving a wine which has a hint of maturity.",Rosé Top,86,45.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Heidsieck & Co Monopole
132849,Argentina,"Peppery red fruit and a strong whiff of a wet dog make this a leap of faith. The palate holds that peppery element while also showing raspberry and cassis notes. Vanilla and wood spice are front and center on the finish, and while it gets better with time, it never quite reaches fifth gear.",Clos des Andes,86,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Hélène Garcin
132850,Italy,"Here's a 50-50 Montepulciano and Sangiovese blend that genuinely reflects the territory it comes from: Aromas of wet earth, blackberry, leather, spice and red beets are woven tightly together. Well-built and firm, the wine shows good persistency on the finish and can stand up to stewed meats or aged cheeses.",Tenuta Pongelli,86,21.0,Central Italy,Rosso Piceno,,Red Blend,Bucci
132851,Italy,"Definitely more neutral than other Pinot Biancos from the same vintage, this wine delivers measured aromas of apple, pear, peach and natural rubber that is consistent with the variety's traditional characteristics. It's an approachable, everyday wine.",,86,18.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Pinot Bianco,Cantina Terlano
132852,Italy,"The brilliant garnet-pink color of this wine makes a great first impression but the wine loses a few points on the nose where Camembert cheese or Parmigiano-like aromas are a distraction. Red-berry fruit fragrances do work their way to the top and the wine has an attractive crisp, spicy close.",,86,16.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Rosé,Cantina Terlano
132853,Italy,"Here's a no fuss wine for everyday dinners with loads of fresh fruit, kiwi, pineapple and a strong emphasis on floral fragrances. The flavors focus on dried fruit, sun-dried apple chips in particular.",le Pietre,86,12.0,Veneto,Veronese,,White Blend,Aldegheri
132854,Argentina,"A little bit of leather and smoke meat give the blackberry bouquet something different, while the palate is round, forward and shows good plum and berry flavors.

132855,US,"From the former Ashley's Vineyard, one of the best-known in the AVA, comes this very ripe, extracted Pinot Noir. Tastes like it had a long hangtime, getting ripe to the point of baked pie-filling cherries and puréed, smoky, almost raisined blackberries. The tradeoff for all this richness is softness and a resulting one-dimensionality.",Cuvée Sandra,86,55.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Demetria
132856,Argentina,"Starts with roasted coffee, berry liqueur and toast, while the palate is pretty dense and loaded with boysenberry and cherry.

132857,Italy,"An interesting aromatic ensemble of exotic fruit, white mineral, natural rubber, almond skin and perfumed flowers set the tone.

132858,US,"A southern Rhône blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache, this wine is stylish and elegant, with a smooth, silky texture.

132860,Italy,"This is textbook Pinot Grigio Delle Venezie—meaning that fruit is sourced from anywhere within the region—with characteristic aromas of Golden Delicious apple, pear, natural rubber, yellow fruit, honey and a playful touch of citrus zest.

132861,US,"This winery seems to be trying to find an identity. The Cabs are vintage-driven, and do better in cool years, which 2004 wasn't. This wine is a little soft and direct, but delicious enough, with ripe, pastry-filling blackberry, cherry, boysenberry and chocolate flavors. You can taste high-char oak on the finish.",Thérèse Vineyards Estate,86,50.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Martin Ranch
132862,US,"This is a perfectly drinkable wine, with good fruit from a great vineyard. It's a bit minty and chalky; let's say rustic. The mixed flavors border on the lightly vegetal side of cool-climate fruit; not sweet but firm.",Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,86,25.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Sangiovese,Andrew Will
132863,New Zealand,"With flavors that range from nectarine through grapefruit and brush up against bell pepper, this is a broad-spectrum Sauvignon Blanc that should prove versatile with food.

132865,US,"This is the most successful of La Crema's three $34 regional Pinots, because it's the fruitiest, most balanced and most satisfying.

132869,Argentina,"Staunch cherry and grape aromas are indicative of what the wine will give. The palate pushes ahead with plum and cherry flavors, but the fruit isn't overly developed and the mouthfeel is more tight and sheer than cushioned and rich. Zesty and firm on the finish, which is par for this course.",,86,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Felipe Rutini

132874,Italy,"This whopper of a wine sees 24 months in wood and is a powerhouse blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.

133053,US,"You'll find lots of ripe, jammy blackberry, cherry, herb tea and tangerine fruit flavor in this soft wine, which is accented with smoky oak. It also has a sharp edge of tannins that makes it astringent. Could soften sometime in 2008, but it's not an ager.",Reserve,86,30.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Artesa

133059,Spain,"Mineral, citrus, natural vanilla and grass aromas send this still-kicking Verdejo on its way. The palate is all about apple and citrus, and the feel is more polished than edgy. Seems as if it's flattening and losing some steam, so drink now.",,86,14.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Cuatro Rayas
133060,Spain,"Peach, nectarine and green pear aromas and flavors dominate this ripe-styled Verdejo-Viura blend.

133061,Argentina,"Starts out with ripe dark-druit aromas, while pepper and charred beef come later. The palate is best up front, where black cherry and dark berry flavors attack well but lose steam fairly quickly. And the finish holds onto some buttery oak that one might rather not taste.

133074,Argentina,"Starts out murky and sweaty, before showing cola, green herbs and leather. It's a rather jumpy, scattershot wine with plum and boysenberry flavors and a grapy, flush finish.

133075,Spain,"Berry fruit, vanilla and violet aromas are friendlier than the rugged, ultrafirm palate on this Syrah-Graciano blend.

133096,France,"Notes of toast and smoky quartz show on the nose, then add pear and apple flavors on the palate.

133098,France,"No, not the goddess: Venus is the name of the horse that plows the Agrapart vineyards. This wine, labeled “nature”—without dosage—is all green apples and very dry.

133106,Spain,"Typically brick-colored and oxidized, which leads to the idea that it's 25 years old already. Unique in every way: The nose is like deconstructed citrus, sherry and leather, while the palate will seem sour if compared to most other reds and zesty if you're coming off a white wine.

Tastes close to dry, with a clean, fresh finish.",,88,24.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Gris,Amisfield

133117,US,"Syrupy and dense, this brings super-ripe blackberry fruit, mocha and butterscotch. What sets it apart from similar California efforts is that it retains natural acids and some lovely herbal highlights, so it's not just a hot, heavy, alcoholic date—the sort that breathes in your ear and leaves you exhausted but somehow unsatisfied.

133137,Australia,"This is a rich, ripe style of Coonawarra Shiraz, amply framed by toasty, cedary oak. The tannins are supple to the point of creaminess, the slightly stewed fruits graced with just a hint of mint. Best from 2010–2015, maybe a few years more.",Special Select,90,65.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,,Shiraz,Penley Estate
133138,US,"Although there's enough of a tannic structure to age this Pinot, you can drink it now. It's dry and silky and accessible, with polished cherry, raspberry, leather, Dr. Pepper cola, star anise and pepper flavors. Goes down nice and easy, but shows considerable complexity.",Toulouse Vineyard,90,42.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Phillips Hill
133139,Germany,"With its delicate aromas of flowers, fresh greens and a hint of mint, you might expect this to be a light, delicate wine. But it's broad and rather sweet, marked by flavors of ripe apples and vanilla. It comes across a bit soft on the finish, but luscious.",Josephshofer Spätlese,90,46.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt
133140,Argentina,"This wine shows molasses and Boston baked beans on the nose along with peppery spice. The bouquet is a touch stewy, but the palate delivers core black cherry and cola along with tight, ripe tannins. The wine takes a little while to warm up and it remains saucy, but that's not uncommon for Mendoza.",Paris Goulart Reserva,86,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Goulart
133141,Italy,"There's a lot a personality here thanks to perky aromas of lemon zest, chopped herbs, fresh sage, yellow pepper and cheerful crisp flavors. This is textbook Sauvignon—easy Italian style—with an emphasis on smoothness.",,86,,Northeastern Italy,Collio,,Sauvignon,Vidussi
133142,US,"Soft and fairly one-dimensional, this Syrah has the taste of perfectly ripened blackberries and black raspberries, crushed and seasoned with cocoa, white pepper and powerded anise. It has 20% Mourvèdre, which seems to bring a slight gaminess.",Les Amours,86,45.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,Vie Winery
133143,Argentina,"Value-level Chardonnay has never really been Argentina's strong suit, but this fuller-bodied version is pretty good. It starts with citrus, orange peel and some dusty scents, which are backed by melon, apple and citrus flavors. It finishes with some pithy bitterness but overall it's nice for Mendoza Chardonnay.",,86,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Septima
133144,US,"Lots of oak on this fresh, young Chard. It's a bit too heavy on the char, toast, vanilla, and woodsap, and not enough about the peaches, pears and pineapples.",Paraiso Vineyards Reserve,86,36.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Pendleton
133145,Argentina,"A difficult wine to assess. For starters, it's heavily oaked and very dark in aromas; think tar, char and espresso. The palate is narrowly focused and tannic, with dark fruit peeking thru here and there. Finishes sheer, with coffee and bitter chocolate. Could get better with time, or it might never really open up. Needs at least another year in bottle to show its true colors.",Auka,86,32.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,San Polo
133146,US,"Anise, blackberry and heady spice on the nose and palate make this 80% Petite Sirah, 18% Merlot, 2% Cabernet Sauvignon an appealing choice for a cold winter's night. The wine has ample structure, but is gentle on the palate, with an elegant, long finish and overall balanced, integrated character.",La Montaña,85,30.0,Arizona,Cochise County,,Red Blend,Dos Cabezas

133149,US,"Chambourcin shows its true colors here with a deep, dense red color and intense, aromatic flavors. Spice and berry on the nose, followed by cherry, vanilla and toast on the palate are both integrated and opulent. There's a touch of angular smoke on the wine but overall, it's a good example of the grape. Pair with lamb or red meat dishes.",,85,16.0,New Jersey,New Jersey,,Chambourcin,Alba
133150,US,"A bit soft and semisweet, this seems to be the victim of an overly hot vintage. It has candied flavors of cherry and blackberry jam and, while a pleasant sipper, isn't really very interesting, although it does show Pinotesque silkiness.",Don Miguel Vineyard,85,39.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
133151,Argentina,"A giant smack of coffee and earth rip at you from the glass, while the palate starts out medicinally sweet before folding in chocolate and leather. The feel settles at soft, but it's not flabby. And the finishing notes of mocha-covered strawberry are pleasant.",,85,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Septima

133155,US,"So sugary sweet, it's basically a dessert wine, and a nice one, at that. The peach and pineapple fruit flavors have a caramelized, tart-filling taste. Not really a table wine, though.",,85,25.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Viognier,Peachy Canyon
133156,US,"Soft and superripe, although dry, this Pinot certainly floods the mouth with attractively creamy crushed berry, cola, tea and spice flavors. But it's not particularly complex and falls apart on the finish. Drink now.",Estate Vineyards,85,33.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Russian Hill
133157,US,"From Kestrel View Estates, this is clean and varietal, a bit high-toned, with a citrus underpinning and simple, plain fruit. Tannins are smooth and ripe, and the oak well-managed. It's a lighter style, with a bit of heat in the finish.",,85,19.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,San Juan Vineyards
133158,US,"In Napa Valley, unless Sauvignon Blanc gets fully ripe, those gooseberries veer toward cat pee and mint. But there's just enough pink grapefruit and honey flavors to save the day for this dry, crisp wine.",,85,16.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Whitehall Lane
133159,Argentina,"Sweet on the bouquet, although there's a bit of a lactic note. The palate is bright and fruity, but the feel is narrow and goes hard with the tannins. Finishes mildly grabby but it's fruity throughout. A good effort but a little challenging. Can you tell that it has its contradictions?",Sol Huarpe,85,14.0,Other,Zonda Valley,,Syrah,Xumek
133160,US,"I get the concept, which is International Cult Style, but the wine is just taking it to an extreme. Too ripe in jellied blackberries and melted milk chocolate, too soft, without enough tannic backbone, and too oaky.",,85,55.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Groth
133161,France,"Very soft, gentle Champagne, showing definite signs of a sweet dosage, with its flavors of brown sugar, baked apples and light acidity. It is full-bodied, which keeps the wine together, but it is too rich.",Grande Réserve Brut,85,24.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Chanoine
133162,US,"Here again the Grand Estates bottling shows a softer, gentler side of the fruit; the acids seem to have been smoothed over.

133163,US,"This is a pretty famous vineyard in Paso and other wineries have made good Zin from it, but this one from Martin & Weyrich tastes as sweet as a dessert pastry, with chocolate fudge, cassis, rum, cola, caramel and peppery spice flavors.

133168,Argentina,"Snappier and more crisp than in the past; this blend of Cabernet and Malbec hits with red-fruit aromas and a touch of vanilla. Next comes raspberry flavors mixed with cola, vanilla and a dollop of butter. Has staying power and depth, but is a little short on core fruit.",Dos Fincas,85,10.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec,Carlos Basso
133169,US,"Almost as sweet as a Port, this has sugary flavors of very ripe blackberries and cassis. Nothing wrong with that, except that it's not really a dry table wine.

133170,Spain,"The wines of Abelis Carthago are enigmatic. The lowest-priced Lui is the most balanced and complete. This wine, William, is dark and dense, with shoe polish and raw crude oil on the nose. It's super strapping and tannic, with bitter chocolate and coffee notes carrying the racy palate to a fiery finish. It lacks nuance and subtlety but will augment a good steak with nary a problem.",William Selection,90,34.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Abelis Carthago
133171,Portugal,"Only the second garrafeira (the name means special selection) made by the Borba cooperative, this is a serious, complex wine that wears its tannins and rich fruits lightly.

133183,US,"This is a dessert wine, and a very pleasurable one. It's sweet but not too sweet, and very high acidity provides crisp balance to the pineapple, peach, honeysuckle, vanilla and spice flavors.

It's a modern bruiser from a modern, spotless facility, and it offers a clash of wild berry flavors, big-time tannins and powerful acidity.

It is fleshed out with intense perfumes, rich fruit skins and kiwi fruit freshness.",Château Haut Mouleyre,90,15.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Blanc,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Bernard Magrez
133316,France,"From 2009, Labégorce-Zédé will no longer exist, being amalgamated with Château Labégorce-Margaux. So this 2007 is one of the last vintages. The wine has solid but lively black fruits, the tannins dark, firm and full of blackberry juice flavors with a touch of cranberry dryness. It is definitely for aging.",,90,,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Labegorce Zédé
133317,France,"That it was possible to soften the somewhat aggressive tannins of 2007 is shown in this smooth, rich wine. It is certainly a wine for early drinking, but it has ripe berry fruit and fresh acidity, with well-judged tannins.",,90,,Bordeaux,Moulis-en-Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Poujeaux
133318,US,"Nice cherry fruit right up front brings some sweetness to this wine. Young as it is, the components are still knitting together, but there is much to enjoy already. Lovely grapey/cherry flavors are wrapped in light herb, and accented with almost salty sea flavors.",Wind Ridge,90,32.0,Oregon,Ribbon Ridge,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Chehalem
133319,France,"A fine, totally sweet-fruited burst of Merlot that brings together fine structure with the beginnings of mature texture. There is a layer of vanilla, a warmly polished feel with glowing berries and sweet spice. Delicious and certainly ready to drink.",P du Roy,90,,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,D & R Dubois
133320,US,"This bottling from Kunde is dependable for its dry, crisp elegance. It always shows bright lemongrass and gooseberry fruit, with more exotic notes of litchi and fig. The trick is to control disagreeable greenness, which pops up here in the finish.",Magnolia Lane,86,16.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Kunde
133321,France,"A semisweet Vouvray, with its honey flavors still tasting very young. The acidity is all green apple, with freshness coming from the white currant edge. Lacheteau is a négociant, based in the Muscadet region.",,86,10.0,Loire Valley,Vouvray,,Chenin Blanc,Lacheteau
133322,Argentina,"Dense, rich and encouraging on the nose, with full blackberry flavors and a flush mouthfeel. For Argentine Cab this gets it right much more than wrong. The flavors are fairly well developed and the finish has length.",,86,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sur de los Andes
133323,Argentina,"Not a bad steak or burger wine given that it offers some kicking acidity to go with sassy cherry and oak-based flavors. This is more of a forward, racy Cabernet. It doesn't lay heavily on the palate; in fact, it's a touch jumpy and staunch despite its oak cask moniker.",Oak Cask,86,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trapiche
133324,Argentina,"Having always liked this wine, which is 86% Cab and the rest Malbec and Merlot, the 2002 seems a touch bland and underwhelming. The color is dense and the nose muscular and herbal, but it peters out quickly and shows no signs that it will get better with age. Imported by Quintessential Wines, LLC.",Enzo Bianchi,86,53.0,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Red Blend,Valentin Bianchi
133325,US,"Nice, rugged mountain Zin, with the briary, brambly tannins and peppery taste of wild berries freshly picked off the vine. Alcohol adds heat and structure, and time in the barrel has softened the tannins. This might just be the perfect backyard barbecue red wine.",,86,16.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Plungerhead
133326,France,"Good, spicy Cabernet Franc, loaded with dry plums and stalky fruit flavors. It's soft, with a streak of acidity to give freshness, but mainly juicy and fruity.",Vallée des Jardins,86,11.0,Loire Valley,Saumur,,Cabernet Franc,Remy-Pannier
133327,US,"A honeyed, velvety-smooth wine. It's ultrarich in cherry pie, raspberry cream and white chocolate truffle flavors, although it's technically dry. The soft tannins, glycerine and high alcohol add to the perception of sweetness.",The Crusader,86,20.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Syrah,Burford & Brown
133328,US,"This Vidal Blanc offers tropical fruit flavors of peach and pineapple and a playful, lively acidity. Balanced and bold, the wine has enough personality to sip on it own. A fun white wine alternative at a nice price.",,86,10.0,Virginia,Virginia,,Vidal Blanc,Chateau Morrisette
133329,Argentina,"A little loose on the bouquet, with a whiff of sulfur and leather to go with wild berry aromas. In the mouth, it's got an Old World coarseness that turns the flavor profile to pepper and espresso. At 60% Cabernet and 40% Malbec, it's worth the price.",Dos Fincas,86,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec,Carlos Basso
133330,Italy,"This wine is a bit strange, especially on the nose where it yields too generous notes of cocoa butter, sun tanning lotion, butterscotch, cherry and sweet vanilla. The nose is definitely sweet, bordering on cloying, and tight tannins will need time to soften.",,86,40.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Farina
133331,Austria,"This Cabernet Sauvignon is rare for the Feilers. Normally the fruit goes into a blend. But in 2005, they have chosen to release a varietal Cabernet, a lean, somewhat austere wine, showing the aging potential, but also just showing some green character. Tough, with high acidity.",,86,20.0,Burgenland,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Feiler-Artinger
133332,US,"From century-old vines growing in a warm part of the valley comes this soft, layered Zin. It shows wild blue- and black-skinned berry fruits that approach raisins, rum punch, cherry liqueur and rosemary-thyme flavors. Tasty Zin, a little simple in structure, but nice and dry.",Old Vines Estate Grown,86,18.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Zinfandel,Ballentine
133333,Austria,"Classic in Austrian terms means no, or very little wood, leaving the fruit to speak for itself. Black cherry fruits, pure and refreshing, suggest this could even be a summer red served chilled.",Classic,86,18.0,Neusiedlersee,,,Zweigelt,Gerhard Pittnauer
133334,Argentina,"Leather, dark fruit and citrus peel make for a good nose, while the palate is meaty and a bit heavy as it pours on those classic dark-fruit flavors that Malbec is known for. Best to get at this one now because neither the palate nor the finish shows much acidity. A touch hollow.",Reservado,86,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Viña Amalia
133335,US,"The best thing about this fine young white wine is the acidity. It's high and crisp and bracing, and makes the peach pie, honeysuckle and vanilla wafer flavors come alive. There's a honeyed sweetness, but that wonderful acidity balances it nicely.",,86,18.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Tocai Friulano,VJB
133336,Argentina,"Big and jammy, and all in all it's a solid, good Malbec. Aromas of tar and prune give way to plum and blackberry flavors. On the finish, it's a touch salty and drying, but with food it will be smoother. Good for the money, although limited in depth and complexity.",Reserva,86,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Julia
133337,US,"As much as I like this Merlot, it feels like they let it get too ripe and gave it too much oak. It was a great vintage, and the grapes ripened effortlessly. Yet there's a baked fruit, toothpicky oakiness that robs the wine of elegance.",,86,42.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Arrowood
133338,US,"This is ripe to the point of richness, showing broad, mouthfilling flavors of melon and fig and just the merest hint of mint. Drink now.",Carol's Vineyard,86,16.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,J. Lohr

133340,US,"The elements of great Cab are all here, from the rich, mountain-dense tannins to the gorgeously ripe blackberry, cassis and fig flavors that are enriched by lots of new, flashy oak. But there's a sweaty funk in the aroma that's off-putting, and makes you wonder.",,86,70.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ladera

133343,Argentina,"Solid, ripe and smooth on the nose, then red cherry and raspberry come forward on the zesty, tangy palate. The finish is long and healthy, but a bit monotone in its delivery. Freshness and pop are not lacking in this young Malbec.",,86,12.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Finca El Portillo

133345,US,Aromas of apple and tropical fruit on this rich Chardonnay lead into vanilla and honey on the palate. The wine is full and opulent in the mouth but not overwrought. Good balance and a lingering finish add to the appeal.,,86,16.0,Virginia,Virginia,,Chardonnay,Chateau Morrisette
133346,France,"The blend—Chenin Blanc, Chardonnay and Cabernet Franc—is typical of Loire sparkling wines. It gives a full mousse in the mouth, herbal and green pea flavors, and a soft, creamy aftertaste, backed up by acidity.",Les Doucinières,86,22.0,Loire Valley,Crémant de Loire,,Sparkling Blend,Château Gaillard
133347,Argentina,"Finding affordable but good Cab is not an easy chore, so let this solid, smoky wine fit that bill. The nose is like a cowboy campfire, complete with hickory, leather and cured meat. The palate is full-force and tannic, with plum and berry fruit. It may be slightly cooked and not for the long haul; so drink now.",Reserva,86,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Julia
133348,Argentina,"Clove and other challenging aromas greet you, and never does this blend of Malbec, Cabernet, Bonarda and Merlot get it fully together. The palate seems a little reduced and short on feel, and while it widens and softens on the finish, the ride to get there is bumpy. Expect better in 2005.",Corte B,86,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Vistalba
133349,US,"SLO has always struggled with this variety, but Wildwood seems to be getting the knack for Cabernet. Tastes like the grapes were grown in a warm area and yields were carefully limited: the flavors of blackberries plums and mocha are rich. The challenge is to improve structure, and particularly tannins, in a wine of this price.",Jackson's Vineyard,86,35.0,California,San Luis Obispo County,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wildwood
133350,Italy,"A blend of Trebbiano, Bombino and Malvasia, this is a simple white that awards an easy, fresh wine experience. Fruity vibrancy and highlights of melon and peach appear over its lean consistency. This is an interesting winery to keep an eye on from Italy's tiny Molise region.",Gironia,85,18.0,Southern Italy,Biferno Bianco,,White Blend,Borgo di Colloredo
133351,US,"Half and half Grenache and Mourvèdre, this rich wine is superripe in jammy blackberry, cherry, orange and root beer flavors. It's not exactly dry, but not really sweet. Very high alcohol creates a peppery burn.",Osiris,85,28.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,Kaleidos

133353,Argentina,"Better than most Argentinean Sauvignon Blancs, and made in a fuller-bodied style. The nose has weight and wax aromas, as well as melon, and the palate features ripe, almost pithy citrus. Dried apricot and a nick of passion fruit work the finish. Drink immediately.",Maipu Vineyards,85,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Pascual Toso
133354,Australia,"The Y Series is Yalumba's entry-level under their own label (the company also produces the Oxford Landing range).

133355,US,"They call it Claret because it's mainly Merlot, with one-third Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is far softer and less tannic than Pride's Cabernets, and riper, too, with blackberry pie-filling and root beer flavors, and finishes a little sweet. Doesn't seem like it has a future, so drink now.",Reserve Claret,85,120.0,California,Sonoma-Napa,Napa-Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Pride Mountain
133356,US,"Pride's '05 Syrah is higher in alcohol than the past few vintages, and not to the wine's benefit.

133358,Spain,"Not a bad value in the Albariño category. Alba Rosa is the second wine from Martinez Serantes, and it's yellowish in color, with a pineapple and pear nose. Solid in the mouth, with touches of apple, white peach and lime. Proper acidity keeps it fresh.",Alba Rosa,85,15.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Adega Martínez Serantes
133359,Spain,"The nose has the vintage's heavy quality, yet the palate runs toward acidic, with an emphasis on red cherry and raspberry.

133360,Spain,"Cantaloupe, almond candy and orange blossom make for a sweet nose. The palate seems too close to orange juice and tangerine than the apple and peach that best defines Rías Baixas. But for anyone who likes fresh, pulpy juice, it tastes perfectly good.",Granbazán Ambar,85,19.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Agro de Bazán

133362,Australia,"Starts off with herbal, almost rhubarb-like aromas, but also some darker, berry-scented notes that ease into flavors of cassis and herbs.

133364,Argentina,"A touch cooked and oaky, but with a sweet, friendly side, too. The palate rests on beefy fruit, and it's chewable and just slightly herbal in nature.

133365,US,"Like a trip through an orchard, this Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre blend bursts with flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries, tangerines, kumquats, dates, golden mangoes, yellow currants, the list goes on and on. It's a little on the sweet side, while grippy tannins give the palate handrails to negotiate this fruity ride.",Morpheus,85,32.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,Kaleidos
133366,US,"Tastes young, sharp in acids and jammy sweet right now, with upfront cherry, raspberry and blackberry flavors. But after all, it is a California Barbera, and these puppies age forever.

133367,Argentina,"A perennial Best Buy among Argentinean Torrontes, Santa Julia always puts out a true and consistent product.

133369,Spain,"There's some stewed fruit weighing down this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon blend, but for the most part it has it going on. Coffee, oak and leather aromas set up a palate of raspberry, plum and chocolate. There's a fair amount of acid for an ‘03, and that lends legs to a wine that might otherwise seem tired.",,85,29.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Vitis Terrarum
133370,US,"A great price for a wine this balanced and savory. It shows citrus, fig and green melon flavors that have real complexity. Acidity and dryness are the hallmarks of this slightly oaky wine, which was grown in Paso Robles.",,85,10.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Meridian
133371,US,"This is a pretty eastern U.S. Merlot, with its subtle, nuanced flavors of red berry, plum and currant and its approachable, soft tannins. Virginia is showing its talent for growing reds and this is a good example of what can be done with good vineyard management and winemaking.",Josie's Knoll,85,18.0,Virginia,Monticello,,Merlot,Lovingston
133372,US,"Tannicly dry, this Merlot has a tough chewiness that makes it hard to appreciate the ripe cherry, blackberry, licorice and cocoa flavors. Could soften with a few years, but not a wine for the long haul.",,85,56.0,California,Napa-Sonoma,North Coast,Merlot,Pride Mountain
133373,US,"There's a feline pungency, not overpowering, but a little goes a long way to smother the citrus, fig and melon fruit flavors. Other than that, the wine is very dry and crisp in acidity.",Dancing Crow Vineyard,85,13.0,California,Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Sauvignon Blanc,Cartlidge & Browne
133374,US,"Clarksburg is pretty much as good as Chenin Blanc gets in California. The warmish area gets Delta breezes that cool things down at night.

133375,US,"A light entry holds flavors of strawberry and tomato leaf, then turns tannic. Chewy and earthy, with more than a hint of seed and stem, this wine comes from biodynamically farmed grapes that add some earthy nuances, but put too much emphasis on green tea, stemmy flavors.",Renegade Ridge Estate,85,75.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Archery Summit
133376,Italy,"From one of Sicily's most beautiful and promising vineyards, Baccante is a blend of Grillo and Chardonnay with bright clean acidity and fragrant yellow fruit.

133379,Spain,"Smooth on the nose, with vanilla and peach aromas. It's starting to fade but if you catch it soon you'll get apple, pineapple and some pithy character on both the palate and finish.

133382,Portugal,"Even for a ruby, this is dark purple in color and attractively saturated in the glass. It's somewhat grapy, but avoids simplicity by blending in hints of mulberries, chocolate and spice.

Not available in the U.S.",Ruby Special Reserve,88,40.0,Port,,,Port,Porto Solene
133383,New Zealand,"Plump and sweet, but reasonably balanced, with a dash of CO2 for extra zest, this vintage of Peg Bay's Riesling seems just a touch behind their previous few releases.

133387,US,"Santa Barbara Cabs continue to have their work cut out for them, but as grapes are sourced from warmer areas, progress is made.

133391,New Zealand,"Like many Hawke's Bay producers, Te Awa is experimenting with Syrah; this bottling features bold blackberry fruit with just a hint of peppery spice.

133392,US,"This is a gentle, easy Pinot for drinking tonight, yet it has something of the power and complexity of the winery's top bottlings.

Silky and dry, the wine has flattering flavors of cherry compote, cola and Provençal herbs.",,88,32.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
133393,US,"This is a blend of vineyards from which the winery sources its fruit. It's a very good wine, dry and crisp, with ripe flavors of cherries, raspberries, root beer and herbs.

133394,Argentina,"Quite dense and ripe, with prune, earth and rubber on the nose.

Weighs in as a full, easy, chewy wine.",Afincado Las Compuertas Vineyard,88,45.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Terrazas de Los Andes
133395,South Africa,"A big, beefy red that spent 22 months in oak. The oak imparts a slight sweetness that softens the tannins without impairing the dark, meaty fruit. Chocolate-espresso notes play in the nose and on the tongue, while the wine picks up flavors of leather and balsam. Finishes as big as it lives, with coffee grounds and dark fruit.",,88,29.0,Stellenbosch,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stellekaya
133396,US,"Very high in alcohol, but with the benefit of dryness, this Zin has a white-pepper note riding high above the blackberry, red cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors.

133402,Argentina,"Rich and borderline syrupy, but restrained enough to keep its focus. The mouth deals brawny red and black fruit encased in meaty tannins. And with some oak-based mocha and coffee on the finish, it is solid as a rock.",Reserva,88,16.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Terrazas de Los Andes
133403,US,"Despite the California appellation, the winery says the grapes are from Santa Barbara, and you can taste a cool-climate acidity permeating this dry, citrusy wine. There's a minerally spine to it, and it finishes with a clean, refreshing scour. Very nice.",,88,18.0,California,California,California Other,Sauvignon Blanc,Oreana
133404,Argentina,"From the Altos Las Hormigas gang comes this Bonarda that hits with more power than precision, yet in the long run it makes the grade as a fun wine with plenty to offer. The nose is full of dark fruit, coffee, vanilla and marzipan, while the palate and finish are equally fruity and forward. The perfect red for burgers.",,87,9.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Colonia Las Liebres
133405,US,"The estate is in the southern end of the appellation, toward Paso Robles, and this full-bodied Chard smacks of apricot preserves, with a spicy, peppery edge. It's adequately acidic and oaked, with a rich, creamy texture.",HMR Estate,87,30.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Adelaida
133406,Argentina,"More lean and tight than bulky, with licorice, pepper and leather aromas. Compact in the mouth, with spice and cherry flavors leading into a peppery, drying finish. Balanced and more traditional than many modern, beefy, unidentifiable reds. Imported by 31 Degrees South Imports.",Gran,87,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Gentile Collins
133407,US,"A bit tough and tannic, but noble enough in structure, this Mendocino mountain Syrah has bold plum, blackberry, mocha and herb flavors, and is very dry.

133409,US,"Here's a heavy, dense, slightly sweet Pinot that may not be at its best now. It's young and jammy, in the way of a wine that hasn't had time to settle down. But the fruit is huge, and the tannins and acids are all there. Cellar until at least 2007.",,87,32.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Alma Rosa

133411,Portugal,"A firmly dry wine, driven by the dark tannins, only opening slowly to give ripe berry fruits. The soft side of the wine does bring out the lighter nature of the Baga in the blend, which has been tamed by wood aging. There is a final flourish of fresh black plum juice.",Quinta das Baceladas,90,26.0,Bairrada,,,Portuguese Red,Caves Aliança
133412,Italy,"This blend of Chardonnay, Friulano and Sauvignon offers a pretty golden color and oak-related aromas, which hold up very nicely to the wine's natural tones of mature peach, apricot and cantaloupe melon.

133414,US,"The vineyard is on the cooler western edge of Paso Robles, and this bottling has been getting better over the years. The '07 is the best yet, a dry, crisp wine of richness and polish.

133415,US,"Swanky is a good word to describe this bone-dry, acidic blend of Viognier, Chenin Blanc, Muscat and Sauvignon Blanc. Something about it reminds you of a martini.

133418,Australia,"This is a rich, powerfully oaky Shiraz, but masses of fruit show through on the finish, offering hope for the future. Now, it will appeal to the same steakhouse crowds who love Silver Oak and Caymus, but in a year or two expect the oak to partially integrate and the wine to become more complete.

133419,US,"This is the least expensive of Barnett's new single-vineyard Pinots, but it's also the richest and tastiest.

133421,Italy,"If you want to taste the true flavors of Northeast Italy, we recommend you try this wine.

133427,Australia,"Despite carrying a lot of alcohol (16% on the label), this powerful mix of mocha, caramel and stewed berries does a good job of hiding it. At first, it seems soft and creamy in texture, but it turns firmer, chewier and more serious on the finish, adding in a hint of espresso. Opt for drinking this over the near term with grilled beef.",,90,32.0,Victoria,Heathcote,,Shiraz,Eppalock Ridge
133428,US,"This is the first vintage for Cab Franc as a varietal wine from Gamache. A lot of blueberry and black cherry shows through, along with generous barrel flavors of smoke and toast.

133433,Australia,"Because of its often formidable structure, d'Arenberg's The Dead Arm is a difficult wine to evaluate when young. The 2006 is dark and extracted, with intense cassis, coffee and chocolate notes but not much complexity or elegance.

133434,France,"Brooding and mysterious, this is a serious wine that deserves a serious steak to go with it.

133436,US,"The '06 was a 16% monster, but delicious. The '07 is just as good, but swings less of a hammer. Alcohol is 14.8%, yet the wine comes across as the concentrated essence of raspberries and cherries, lifted with all-natural acids, and showing a piercing core that just keeps on going.",Pheasant Vineyard,90,26.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Zinfandel,Trio Vintners
133437,Portugal,"You want big, bold flavors, plenty of spicy wood? It's all here inside the heavyweight bottle.

Give it 2–3 years.",,90,29.0,Estremadura,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Boição
133438,Portugal,"The Dão's very own white variety, Encruzado gives a citric, bright lime and grapefruit wine, with a delicious bite of pear skin.

133439,Germany,"At 13.5% alcohol, this is pretty ripe Riesling, broad in the mouth and almost oily in texture.

133445,US,"Craig has struggled to move this Paso Robles Syrah off-center and into the end zone for years. The fight continues.

133446,Argentina,"Rutini's value brand exhibits a lot of forced toast, popcorn and burnt notes, all of which tells us that they want us to smell and taste oak.

Candied but pleasant.",Trumpeter,85,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rutini

133449,Argentina,"Of all the large-format White Pearl varietals, this Torrontes tastes and feels the best.

133452,US,"This is an extraordinarily lush and complex Syrah, but I have one major objection. From the Ballard Canyon section of the valley, it has 4% Syrah, and a small percentage of new oak that adds a smoky, caramelly richness to the blackberry, cherry and raspberry fruit flavors. My problem is the sweetness. It tastes like there's residual sugar, pushing the wine beyond table status into dessert territory.",,85,27.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Grenache,Harrison Clarke
133453,Romania,"This collectible botrytis Riesling grown on the banks of the Danube in Romania is very concentrated, with heady flavors of honey, caramel and apricot and a nutty overall character.

Imported by Vidalco International, LLC.",Dulce,85,320.0,Vânju Mare,,,Riesling,Sirena Dunarii
133454,Argentina,"Spice, rose hips and raspberry make for an open and welcoming nose. The palate delivers generic berry flavors, size, tannins and spice. It finishes a little harsh, with pepper and burnt notes. But mostly it's a solid everyday Malbec.",Henry Lagarde Reserve,85,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Lagarde
133455,Argentina,"A big and mauling version of Malbec. The nose is minty and dark, while the palate runs syrupy and full, with heavy black-fruit flavors darkened even more by a persistent peppery streak. Much less restrained and elegant than the Kaiken Ultra.",,85,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Kaiken
133456,US,This is a bit flat and one-dimensional. The cherry and raspberry flavors would benefit from greater vitality and a drier finish. But it's okay for an everyday red.,,85,28.0,California,San Benito County,Central Coast,Malbec,Leal Vineyards
133457,Argentina,"Big and fruity, and for the most part holds together and exhibits more good qualities than its faults.

133458,US,"With the racy acidity this variety is known for when grown in a cool place, this is a good palate cleanser. It's a little on the candied side, with candied pineapple flavors, but that zestiness is really nice.",Goodchild Vineyard,85,18.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Gris,Epiphany
133459,Argentina,"Over the years the Fantelli wines have not impressed, but this Torrontes works nicely, especially if you like some weight and sweetness to your white wine. The nose offers apple blossoms and honey, while the peach, pear and applesauce flavors are round and sweet. Seems to have some residual sugar.",,85,9.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Fantelli

133462,Italy,"Mature peach and stone fruit, honeysuckle and pine nut come to mind as do dried Mediterranean herbs.

133469,US,"The grapes represent an interesting span, coming from Carneros, Dry Creek Valley and even some from Mendocino's Eaglepoint Ranch. The blend is Zin, with Syrah and Petite Syrah. The flavors are a wild medley of LifeSaver candies, and the finish is too sweet.",L'Etranger Zinfandel Blend,84,39.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Vie Winery

133471,US,"This wine seems a bit stretched—it has been pushed to its limits, and perhaps beyond.

133474,Spain,"Montsant's inherent character is nicely captured in this blend of Carignan, Syrah and Grenache. The bouquet is entirely smooth and inviting, if a bit generic.

Never does it really unfold or find a groove, and at times it's aggressive.",Parcela El Nogal,84,75.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Pago de los Capellanes
133668,US,"It's a dark, grapy purple, with substantial tannins, but there is little in the way of fruit and in its place a whole lot of earth and damp soil.

133669,US,"Grgich has struggled with this uneven bottling over the years, and the 2003 shows the problems that have plagued the wine. It combines sharpness with sugary cherry-berry flavors, making for a sweet and sour taste. There are tannins aplenty, but it doesn't seem like an ager.",Yountville Selection,84,135.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Blend,Grgich Hills
133670,Australia,"Seems a touch overripe, with fruit that leans toward the pruny side of plum, then adds dark chocolate flavors. It's broad on the attack, then   narrows considerably on the finish and is pulled together by crisp acids that accentuate the wine's dusty tannins.",Mulberry Tree,84,17.0,South Australia,Langhorne Creek,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bleasdale
133671,US,"With its enticing aromas and flavors of anise, berry and spice, this New Mexico Cabernet has body and a kick to it that's impressive, and is a fun cohort to grilled steak or ribs.

133675,Spain,"At 70% Tempranillo and only 25% Cabernet and Merlot, there's a detectable green core running through the nose and palate. Surrounding that is sizable fruit and oak, the latter of which adds dill to the fray.

133685,Portugal,"This medium-bodied blend of Touriga Nacional (45%), Touriga Franca (35%) and Tinta Roriz (20%) lacks a bit of flesh, but you wouldn't call it lean, either.

133686,New Zealand,"A Bordeaux-inspired blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot, 8% Cabernet Franc and 1% Malbec, this is a firmly structured wine that seems meant to age.

133692,South Africa,"Tokara's winemaker has crafted this full-bodied wine under his own label. It has plenty of flesh and orange and apricot flavors from Viognier, despite the other two-thirds being Chenin Blanc. But the real dominant force here is the oak, which the wine wears tightly wrapped, hiding the fruit character. Vanilla and spice hit the palate and continue through the finish, where alcohol warms things up.",Saskia,87,35.0,Coastal Region,,,White Blend,Miles Mossop

Expect to be pleased but not blown away.",Reserva,89,30.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Arviza
133753,Spain,"Very nice for a 2002. The wine is elegant and delivers aromas of violets, minerals and dried fruits. The palate folds in chocolate and spice along with a layer of blackberry flavor. We wouldn't call it superconcentrated or complex, but it's driven, pure and pleasurable.

133902,Germany,"Give this wine some air before you serve it in order to appreciate the entire range of its dense aromatics, which flow from delicate tangerine, to peach and on into the mineral end of the spectrum.

133906,New Zealand,"Part of Pernod Ricard New Zealand, Church Road is a historic property dating back to the end of the 19th century, so it is a shame that the wines are not available in the U.S. The 2007 Reserve Cabernet Merlot features delicate scents of dried herbs and tea leaves allied to bold cassis and cherry fruit. It's firm and slightly drying on the finish; give it until 2015 to come into its own.",Reserve,90,,Hawke's Bay,,,Cabernet Merlot,Church Road
133907,France,"A densely textured wine, but one with the weight of fruit to sustain the dry core. It is sold, chunky, pulling black berry fruits and plum skins into a good mélange of flavors.

134022,Germany,"Released in the U.S. a bit later than most German wines, Raimund Prüm's 2006 Würzgarten kabinett remains primary and fresh, filling the room with aromas of green apple, lime and slate.

A unique and versatile food wine.",,89,20.0,Santorini,,,Assyrtico,Boutari
134024,Argentina,"Ripe to the tipping point of being a little bit baked, but the nose of spice and mint mixed with violet, black cherry and plum is attractive.

134030,Spain,"A mixture of baked fruit, bacon, asphalt and leather aromas is impressive, and so is the bright, composed palate and its flavors of plum, raspberry and tobacco.

134042,US,"A controversial wine due to its amazing power. It's just tremendous in apricot, peach, nectarine, marzipan and crème brûlée flavors, like some dainty from a great pastry chef.

134105,US,"Bob Cabral's Chardonnays sometimes get lost in the brilliant glare of his Pinot Noirs, but he has spent years exploring the rich, flamboyant side of the variety, with great success. This bottling represents William Selyem Chardonnay at its best. It's ultra-decadent in apricot and pear flavors, with a strong oak influence, and yet an underlying minerality and fine acidity balance it so that it doesn't tire as you drink. In fact, you want more.",Heintz Vineyard,96,50.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
134106,US,"This is 100% varietal, from the Loess, Seven Hills, Pepper Bridge, and Mill Creek Upland vineyards. A deep, intense take on Merlot, it's so dark and concentrated that it dances on the )edge of bitterness, but in a style reminiscent of the finest Italian Merlots, that use that flavor to define and elucidate a dark and potent wine. In the mouth it fills out with luscious cherry and plum and blackberry fruit, baking chocolate, coconut and nougat. Yet it remains sleek and stylish, with a strong licorice note.",,96,70.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Leonetti Cellar

134108,US,"Violets and compost dance through the aromas, leading into an intensely fruity palate loaded with sappy berry richness, nuanced with scents and streaks of cured meat, garrigue, earth and graphite. Blending 77% Syrah with 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, it strikes a perfect balance among fruit, earth, and rock. At its core it is still wrapped tight, immaculately clean, and still almost impenetrably dense.",Rediviva of the Stones Red,95,55.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Buty
134109,US,"Amazingly rich, one of the most opulent Chardonnays you can drink now. Just wows the mouth with pineapple, pear, exotic tropical fruit, crème brûlée, vanilla custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on through the finish.

134110,US,"From the first sniff you are captivated—this incorporates all the many scents and flavors of great Washington Syrah. Start with earth, seaweed, compost; bring in ripe berry fruit, vanilla, tobacco. That is the nose. In the mouth you get perfect fruit—bright, tangy, a mix of berries and cherries and cassis—highlighted with sharp, defining acidity and polished tannins.

134114,US,"A unique version of Andrew Will's Champoux, this is more than half Cabernet Franc, with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot filling in the rest. Thick and tannic, yet perfectly ripe and almost silky, it coats the palate with black cherry, graphite, slate and a bit of chalk. All that said, the fruit more than holds its own against the terroir's minerality.

134122,US,"Bring this bottle straight to the cellar. Don't even think about opening it before, say, 2013. All you'll get is a mouthful of hard, sandpapery tannins. But it's a very deeply flavored Cabernet, packed with massive blackberry, black currant, plum and cedar flavors, and there's a granitic minerality that must come from the soil. Very finely crafted.",Estate,94,125.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vineyard 7&8
134123,US,"DeLille's take on a first-growth Bordeaux Blanc really shines in this excellent vintage. Toasty and firm, it captures the lushness of the Sémillon fruit while mixing in bright citrus.

134127,US,"A powerful and dramatic Pinot Noir. The first thing you notice is the depth. The range of flavors goes on and on, ranging from cherries, oranges and cola through mocha to more classic notes of forest floor, mushrooms and peppery spices.

134189,Australia,"There's definitely some horsey notes on the nose, but the decadent palate, with its intoxicating blend of raspberry, loganberry and cranberry, all couched in a sophisticated vanilla and coffee framework, takes the day.

134191,US,"Quite a bit sweeter on the palate than J's Pinot Gris in the past, with a sugary edge to the otherwise pretty pineapple, vanilla and wildflower flavors.

134194,Argentina,"Quite tropical on the nose, with aromas of pineapple and passion fruit. The palate is a soft, honeyed bowl of kiwi, melon, cucumber and white pepper, while the finish is dry and gets more hollow as the wine warms up. Not a classic Sauvignon, but it has its virtues.",Reserva,84,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Luigi Bosca

134199,Argentina,"California winemaker Patrick Campbell makes this perfumed, unusual Chardonnay, which is challenged but ultimately proves its worth.

134200,US,"From a variety with a reputation for rusticity, this Carignan is from a vineyard interspersed with Zinfandel, Barbera, and perhaps other varieties.

134205,US,"At about four years, this Merlot, from the southerly Oak Knoll region of the valley, is overtly sweet, possibly from high alcohol. The official reading is 15.3%.

134281,Spain,"The aromas are powerful and just the slightest bit brambly. A little hot and rugged on the palate, but loaded with prime black fruit, pepper and mocha notes. It's a potent wine with meaty blackness and plenty of raw power. With 65,000 cases produced, it's not a “boutique” wine, as evidenced by the friendly price tag.",Crianza,89,16.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Muruve
134282,Australia,"Different from most McLaren Vale wineries, at Pannell the Shiraz is softer and more approachable than the Grenache.

Drink now–2015.",,89,58.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,S.C. Pannell
134283,Portugal,"A fine, elegant wood-aged wine. It has ripe fruits, sweet peach, apricot, mango, while the vanilla of toast lifts all the flavors, adding spicy smoothness. Acidity comes from fresh lime. It could do with some aging, maybe 2–3 years.",Escolha Branco,89,19.0,Bucelas,,,Arinto,Quinta do Boição
134284,Portugal,"An exotic blend including Pinot Noir and Merlot along with Portuguese varieties, taking its name from two local villages with saint's names. It has acidity and an awkward bitter edge, with tough black fruits. Maybe it needs time for the wine to soften and meld with the tight acidity.",,89,25.0,Bairrada,,,Pinot Noir,Campolargo
134285,US,"The addition of 6% Grenache to the blend is effective, contributing bright spicy red fruit highlights. The Syrah is varietal, with bloody beef, dried herb and dark, peppery fruit. It shows a little too much heat in the finish.",The Dungeon,89,29.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Cuillin Hills
134286,Germany,"Kicks off with intensely petrol-like aromas and hints of vegetable oil rather than overt fruitiness, then develops flavors of honey, marmalade and spice on the palate.

134287,US,"The vineyard is virtually in Dry Creek Valley, so it's not surprising to find the briary, brambly intensity of that warm Sonoma appellation.

134292,US,"This five-grape Bordeaux blend was aged in 65% new French oak for 20 months. Smooth and complex, this is a sharp, spicy red wine loaded with bright fruits.

134299,Portugal,"An elegant style, the ripe fruit restrained and kept in check by the dry tannins and acidity.

One year it's pungent and green, and then in a warm year like 2006 it's fruity, ripe and sweet, with green apple, pear and tropical fruit flavors making their mark.

134453,Moldova,"With 75% Cabernet and 25% Merlot, this older Codru blend has a nice, smooth mouthfeel from soft, aged tannins. Light bodied, with brown tobacco and stem flavors following a nose of brown spice and smoke. Drink up, as the fruit has long since gone, but it's worth trying just for the feel.",Collection Codru,85,22.0,Moldova,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Cricova
134454,US,"Here's a good everyday Chard, offering immediate pleasure in the ripe tropical fruit and peach flavors, creamy texture and smoky oak influence. It's a blend of Russian River and Alexander Valley.",,85,14.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Huntington
134455,US,"Opens with the baked brown sugar, caramelly aroma of a Port-style wine, and tastes almost as sweet. This is actually a delicious wine, with good tannins and acids to balance the sugar, but it's not really a dry table wine.",Heritage Vineyards Petros,85,40.0,California,Redwood Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Merlot,Lolonis
134456,US,"From one of the most underrated white wine appellations in California comes this crisp, fruity wine, resembling a nice German Kabinett.

134458,US,"Black cherry fruit stars in this dry, rustic wine. It has strong acids and dusty, astringent tannins, making it worthy of cheese, oil, sausage, tomatoes, that kind of fare.",Di Collina,85,20.0,California,San Pasqual,South Coast,Sangiovese,Orfila
134459,US,"Crisp and grassy-citrusy, with fig and melon overtones and a touch of wildflower honey in the finish, this is textbook Sauvignon Blanc. It has a streamlined elegance that makes it easy to drink, and will be versatile with an enormous range of foods.",,85,14.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Simi
134460,Australia,"A great representative of Australian Grenache, with flavors of black fruit, road tar and raspberry liqueur fading to a palate of brambly fruit, all of which is couched in mocha and vanilla tones from toasty French oak. There's a bit of raspberry jam and a faint grip on the medium finish. Drink now.",Old Vine,89,25.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Grenache,Yangarra Estate Vineyard
134461,France,"Gorgeously nuanced nose, with almond, marzipan, melon, lime and fresia up front, set against a palate of Brazil nut and cinnamon toast. Soft and lush, the long finish picks up a nutmeg accent. Noticeable sweetness suggests this wine will work well as an apéritif. Drink now for its freshness or cellar a few years for more complexity.",Grand Cru Mambourg,89,35.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Pierre Sparr
134462,US,"Made in an immediately accessible style, this is a softly gentle, silky Pinot Noir with lots of delicious flavor.

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Twin Oaks
134463,New Zealand,"Made in a medium-sweet style with only 9% alcohol, this is an intensely flavored wine filled with green apple and lime. There's a touch of petrol on the nose, and it reappears on the long, sweet-tart finish.",Envoy,89,,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Spy Valley

134465,Italy,"Here's an elegant Italian sparkler with toasty aromas of roasted nut, dried fruit and freshly baked bread.

134466,US,"This forward, light, elegant wine sports bright raspberry fruit flavors first and foremost. Young and fresh, it drinks like a good cru Beaujolais, but with a little bottle age could reveal more inner stuffing.",,89,30.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Adelsheim
134467,New Zealand,The 2008 Alana Estate Pinot boasts a perfumed bouquet that includes elements of rose petals and sandalwood to accent savory and black-cherry notes. The silky texture is also spot on; one just wishes for a little more flavor intensity and length. Drink it over the next few years.,Single Vineyard,89,50.0,Martinborough,,,Pinot Noir,Alana Estate
134468,France,"A solidly tannic wine, the dusty tannins suspended in the chunky fruits.

134469,New Zealand,"Le Sol's little brother isn't yet available in the U.S., but it offers a decent introduction to the Craggy Range style of Syrah.

134470,US,"This was presented from a bottle that had been open for a day. The scents and flavors were a bit muted, with plump plum and blueberry fruit, a whiff of animal and herb. The acidity has a strong citrus character that juts out, even after so much time to breathe.",Mark Bradford Vineyard,89,90.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Domaine Serene

134472,US,"Cab Franc has always been one of the best potential wines in these Foothills, and now, veteran Easton tackles it with special focus.

134475,Spain,"Opens with rooty, mature aromas of tobacco, baked berry and raisin, while the palate is full and roasted, with sweet baked-plum and brown sugar flavors.

134477,Australia,"Bold and oaky, this Shiraz-Cab blend starts out with notes of sawdust but quickly turns to guava and roses, backed up by earth and cigar. The muscular tannins and sinewy acidity could use two to three years cellaring to integrate better.",Bernoota,89,25.0,South Australia,Langhorne Creek,,Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon,Lake Breeze
134478,US,"An appealing mix of fruit and forest floor aromas waft from the glass, leading you into a tart, spicy and earthy wine with well-balanced red fruits, white pepper, bark and graphite flavors.

134480,South Africa,"Thelema's trademark mintiness is a star here, as are the rich, savory flavors of black currant, coffee and spice on the palate. Poised but giving, the wine has an ageable quality and will be delicious with roast lamb or beef.",,89,41.0,Stellenbosch,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Thelema
134481,France,"Just off-dry, with intense flower and stone fruit aromas and a silky, decadent texture. The finish of white cherries, fig and lemon goes on and on. Drink now for its lovely, youthful fruit or stash it for a few years for more complexity.",Cuvée Cecile,89,30.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Lucien Albrecht
134482,France,"A firm, spicy wine, its fruit and tannins showing the character of the vintage, but also with some weight.

A success.",Château d'Arche,89,25.0,Bordeaux,Haut-Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Mähler-Besse

Ready now.",Estate,89,18.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Laetitia
134485,Greece,"This elegant, aromatic white combines pear and flowers with a crisp, citrusy lift. Good minerality and depth with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. A unique, pretty white that is a standout as a solo sip or with lighter fare.",Private Label White,89,,Attica,,,Savatiano,My Big Fat Greek Wine
134486,Italy,"Elegant and tight, this pale pink sparkling wine boasts a wide array of small fruit and floral aromas. This vibrant wine would pair well with fried calamari or shellfish thanks to its delicate nature and bright acidity.",Rosé Talento,89,14.0,Northeastern Italy,Trento,,Sparkling Blend,Rotari
134487,France,"A lovely expression of place, with exuberant aromas of honey, beeswax, lanolin and gardenias, giving way to carnations and rosewater in the mouth. The palate is dry and almost chalky in its mineral expression. Finishes on a vanilla note. Drink now or hold several years for even more complexity.",Clos St. Landelin,89,,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,René Muré
134488,France,"Soft, dusty tannins balance a wine that is full of the ripest fruit. It has power, but gentle power, with rounded corners and a texture that is dense, never hard. The fruits are ripe plums, perhaps lacking final freshness.",,89,35.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château de Ferrand
134489,US,"High alcohol, approaching 16%, compromises this wine. If you can get past the heat and superripeness, it defines one aspect of the modern style, in a flashy, Napa way. Offers massive waves of jammy blackberries and mocha, and is probably best now and for a couple of years.",,89,60.0,California,Atlas Peak,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Coniglio
134490,US,"Simple and direct, with cherry-berry and new oak flavors that have an edge of rosemary and thyme. My chief complaint is the apparent sweetness.",Home Ranch,84,25.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Sbragia
134491,France,"Rather fat, this misses the essential freshness of good Muscadet. The flavors are of white pears, a touch of almonds and kiwis; needs more lift.",Vallée des Jardins,84,10.0,Loire Valley,Muscadet Sèvre et Maine,,Melon,Remy-Pannier
134492,US,"Ripeness was the issue in this cool vintage, and there's a touch of good old cat pee here. Not too much, but enough to make the wine unattractive despite the nice dryness.",Edna Ranch,84,18.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Tolosa
134493,Argentina,"Not a bad value. The wine is a touch reduced and short on mouthfeel and aromatics, but it still delivers creamy vanilla flavors, raspberry essence and decent density. The sum of all its parts is better than the individual components. Best now, and in casual settings.",Oak,84,8.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Telteca
134494,US,"Soft and sweet, although there's a lot going on, taste-wise. Flavors of pineapples, peaches, pears and vanilla are wrapped into an oaky, creamy package. But the wine would benefit from more acidity and less sweetness.",Garbiella Ranch,84,14.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,VJB
134495,US,"Pellegrini's Cabs always seem to have a rustic edge, meaning the sharp-elbowed tannins, and the green, dried herb flavors that dominate. The wine's structure is great, but it would really benefit from more fruity richness.",Cloverdale Ranch,84,24.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pellegrini
134496,France,"A soft, smooth, apples-and-cream-flavored wine, shot with acidity and some green fruit. It's a light wine, very crisp and clean, better with food than as an apéritif.",Vallée des Jardins,84,10.0,Loire Valley,Vin de Pays du Jardin de la France,,Chardonnay,Remy-Pannier
134497,US,"I'd like to like this wine more than I do, because the acidity is brilliantly clean and scouring, which is a good thing, and the citrus, gooseberry, fig and wildflower flavors are very Marlborough-like. But the sugary finish is a letdown.",Estate,84,16.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Clos La Chance
134498,US,"I like the dry balance, with its well-crafted tannins, brisk acidity and gentle touch of oak. But the taste is disappointingly thin, showing herb-dominated dill and tobacco, with just a splash of cherry fruit.",Mitsuko's Vineyard,84,25.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Merlot,Clos Pegase
134499,France,"Despite its provenance from a warm year, this still shows too much stalky character. Wood rounds it, but also dominates. It's dry and firm, with a smoky aftertaste.",M de Montguéret,84,15.0,Loire Valley,Anjou Villages,,Cabernet Franc,Château de Montguéret
134500,Argentina,"Better than jug wine even if it comes in a big bottle, with clean, lightly expressive cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. There's a little heat and roughness to the finish, but given the league that it's playing in you can't complain about the overall quality of this Mendoza Cabernet. A big-time barbecue or party wine.",White Pearl,84,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Antonio Cesar Cavalli
134501,Argentina,"Opens with a smoke shack full of hickory and jerky before settling in a dark mass. The palate is sweet and a touch awkward, with heavy Port-like weight and strange but provoking berry flavors. An odd blend of Malbec, Cab and Syrah that needs fine tuning.",Amauta,84,20.0,Other,Cafayate,,Red Blend,Bodegas El Porvenir De Los Andes
134502,US,"Typical, elegant flavors of honey, tropical fruit and apricot pervade this wine, which is lead by a full-bodied nose of white flowers. The mouthfeel is measured and not as heavy as some Viogniers, and the finish lingering.",Estate Bottled,84,15.0,Ohio,Ohio,,Viognier,Hermes
134503,Argentina,"For the price, this is pretty good. Not very Syrah-like, but if you enjoy plum, cherry and currant flavors along with pretty good mouthfeel and balance, you'll get it here.",Uma,84,6.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Shiraz,Telteca
134504,US,"Pretty generic Napa Cab, ripe in jammy cherry and blackberry fruit and well-oaked, with vanilla and caramel char. There's a little too much sugary sweetness to qualify for dryness.",,84,55.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bennett Lane

134507,US,"Just about half Chardonnay and half Pinot Noir, with a touch of Pinot Meunier, this fruit-forward bubbly  tastes sweet, even by California sparkling wine standards.

134509,US,"Like most Garys' Pinots, this is an enormous wine in both fruit and alcohol. It detonates on the palate with mega-flavors of ripe cherries, raspberries and vanilla cola. Yet it maintains a pure, elegant Pinot Noir silkiness. However, there's a funky, sweaty smell that's a turn-off.",Garys' Vineyard,84,75.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,La Rochelle
134510,US,"Good everyday Chard, a little minty, but rewards for its upfront pineapple pie, peaches and cream and vanilla smoke flavors. The tart acidity actually works to balance out the richness.",,84,16.0,California,Calaveras County,Sierra Foothills,Chardonnay,Chatom
134511,US,"With a touch of residual sugar, this PG benefits from zesty acidity and appealingly forward lemon, peach, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors. It's a delightful wine that makes you think of summer days on the beach.",,84,11.0,California,California,California Other,Pinot Grigio,Blackstone

134518,Argentina,"Almost sugar-beet sweet on the nose, with a good dose of oak and size. The palate is expectedly big, but with fairly hard tannins and limited depth of fruit.

134519,US,"Shows the gorgeous tannins of this appellation, all firm but pliant velvet, with nicely balanced blackberry and cassis flavors.

134522,Argentina,"Rhubarb and tomato leaf are strongly present on the nose, followed by grassy flavors and a hollow, thin mouthfeel.

134548,Argentina,"Overripe. The nose has thick citrus and cantaloupe aromas, while the palate shows chunky melon and citrus juice. Extremely round but limited in terms of what it offers.",,82,6.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Funky Llama
134549,US,"Hot and awkward, with jammy cherry, blackberry and chocolate flavors. High alcohol gives this wine an unbalanced, chili pepper burn.",Vintner Select Cuvée,82,75.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Pride Mountain
134550,Spain,"Violet and blackberry aromas are an inviting first act, while the palate is lush and fairly deep, with thick blackberry and mildly brambly flavors. Maybe it doesn't reach the penthouse, but as Ribera del Duero goes it more than makes the grade. 45,000 cases made.",Crianza,88,22.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Conde de Siruela
134551,US,"The barrel influence is laid on a bit thick, but the fruit flavors mix berries, cherries and bleed into licorice, chocolate and a hint of tar. Tasted against a comparable Fielding Hills it's just a bit lighter and less well integrated.",Miss de Miner Red,88,28.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Hard Row To Hoe
134552,Spain,"Dark plum aromas are sweetened and softened by oak-based coconut aromas, while the color and weight are deeper and darker than average. The palate is full, ripe, semicushioned but also acidic and vital, with black fruit, mocha and coffee notes. It finishes chocolaty, with a slight herbal note.",Finca Monasterio,88,55.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Baron De Ley
134553,US,"This vineyard designate from Chelle den Millie is spicy and tart. There is medium concentration to the fruit, a mix of cassis and black cherry. The overall potency is heightened by strong scents of herbal spice and grippy tannins, ripe but still showing some of the varietal leaf and moist earth flavors.",Reserve,88,36.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Franc,Basel Cellars
134554,Argentina,"Lively black cherry and plum aromas indicate that this slightly older wine is still vibrant and healthy. The palate is solid, tannic and medium in weight, with sweet but balanced dark-fruit flavors. This is a tasty, well-made, familiar style of Malbec.",,88,25.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Carmelo Patti
134555,Italy,Here's a creamy Chardonnay that epitomizes the generous style of white wine that is so popular in northeast Italy. Borgo Conventi is owned by Tuscany's Ruffino and the wine has been deftly executed to bring out the natural softness and fullness of the variety.,,88,17.0,Northeastern Italy,Collio,,Chardonnay,Borgo Conventi
134556,Italy,"Here's a wine that delivers both fragrant aromas and impressive structure in one glass. Made with Sauvignon, Picol offers layers of orange zest, passion fruit and lemongrass. It also has density and staying power.",Picol,88,30.0,Northeastern Italy,Friuli Isonzo,,Sauvignon,Lis Neris
134557,US,"Very spicy and aromatic, this immediately stands out in the crowded field of Washington Rieslings. The ripe, tangy green fruits are wrapped in a mint/licorice candy coating; the flavors seem to gather strength and persist well into a long finish. This may not appeal to purists, but it definitely delivers a lot of clean, bracing flavor.",,88,19.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Riesling,Olsen
134558,Spain,"Not much different than the basic Sarria rosado, with maybe a touch more concentration and richness. The nose is a bit dusty, with good berry fruit notes and a whiff of cherry blossom. The palate is wet and fresh, with raspberry and plum-skin flavors. Crisp and refreshing.",Viñedo N° 5 Rosé,88,14.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Garnacha,Señorío de Sarria

134560,Argentina,"Saturated Malbec, with an opaque color and dense, sweet aromas that are slightly floral and pastry-like.

134562,US,"Testarossa held back the release date for a while, but this is still a pretty tannic wine. Feels heavy and furry, although the complex black cherry, plum and bacon flavors break through to impress. A bit awkward tasted in the Spring of 2009, but could evolve after mid-2010.",Fritschen Vineyard,88,54.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
134563,US,"Distinctly different from the Avery vineyard bottling, this has pleasing, brambly strawberry fruit flavors, intertwined with spice, cola and a bit of Dr. Pepper. Not a big wine, but loaded with fruit flavor.",Les Collines Vineyard,88,20.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Zinfandel,Three Angels
134564,Italy,"This is an immaculate Pinot Grigio with pristine aromas of stone fruit, white stone and honeysuckle. The wine is smooth and creamy in the mouth and begs a pairing with Tandoori chicken. In fact, it's hard to find a Grigio with this level of intensity.",Sot Lis Rivis,88,24.0,Northeastern Italy,Friuli Isonzo,,Pinot Grigio,Ronco del Gelso
134565,Luxembourg,"Starts with aromas of minerals, pear and apple, and on the palate, offers an elegant balance of taut acidity and rounded honey flavors. Refreshing but rich. An appealing white with a unique character.",Domaine et Tradition Machtum Hohfels,88,50.0,Moselle Luxembourgeoise,,,Pinot Gris,Mme Aly Duhr et Fils
134566,Italy,"Petrussa's oak-aged Chardonnay is still drinking young and seems a bit tight and firm in the mouth. Let it unwind over the next few months to deliver more intense notes of exotic fruit, milled white pepper, toasted nut, vanilla bean and banana. The wine has well-integrated acidity and a slightly herbal note on the close.",,88,20.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,Chardonnay,Petrussa
134567,US,"This Merlot/Cabernet value offering from Meek drinks very well. Fruit is solid and plentiful, a bowl of mixed cherries, stone fruits and plum. Nice chocolaty layering in the finish, which is smooth and creamy. Delicious.",WJ Meek Red Wine,88,13.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Meek Family
134568,Italy,"Malpelo is a ramato-style Pinot Grigio (which means it sports a copperish color) with a cool glass closure that has done a good job of locking in the wine's fresh fragrances of citrus, rose, peach and white spice. Pair this wine with tuna steak or raw salmon tartar.",Malpelo,88,27.0,Northeastern Italy,Venezia Giulia,,Pinot Grigio,Plozner
134569,Portugal,"The Jaen, known in Bierzo, Spain as Mencia, gives freshly juicy wines, but with a definite edge of structure. This example has those characters, as well as concentration and ripeness. It is balanced, elegant, a great food wine.",,88,26.0,Dão,,,Jaen,Quinta das Maias
134570,US,"Young, fragrant, and loaded with milk chocolate and spicy berry. Tight, tannic, with grip and tang; pleasingly moderate, listed under 14% alcohol. Although this has no Grenache in it, it has that sort of tart berry quality, with stiffer tannins.",Mélange Noir,88,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Waterbrook

134572,US,"Rather tough and astringent now, with crunchy, dry tannins and acidity dominating. These are very fine vineyards but the vintage was so-so. With its core of cherries, red currants and cola, it could develop over the next six years.",Rochioli-Allen Vineyards,88,70.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
134573,US,"Very vibrant in acidity and bright green fruit character, suggesting limes, lychee and lemongrass. A drop of Viognier and a tiny percent of oak add softening, enriching notes. Very fine and dry. Good with ceviche, grilled veggies on bruschetta topped with melted goat cheese.",Block Collection River Ranches,88,20.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Geyser Peak
134574,US,"Here's a gusty, bold Zin whose powerhouse flavors call for equally strong fare, such as braised short ribs and barbecue. The wine is fully dry and full-bodied, with explosive flavors of blackberries, plums, anise, balsamic-splashed sautéed mushrooms, espresso, tabasco and pepper. Finishes a bit Porty in raisins. Drink now.",Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard,88,40.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield

Now through 2010 for freshness.",,88,27.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau St. Jean
134576,Portugal,"Bairrada's difficult grape, the Baga, needs time for aging, which is what has happened here. The result is a wine that is fragrant, not heavy, poised and fresh. The red berry fruits are lifted by acidity, there is a tell-tale Baga dry tannic core, but well in balance. A great food wine.",Quinta da Rigodeira Baga,88,11.0,Bairrada,,,Baga,Caves Aliança

134578,Portugal,"A very Portuguese version of Cabernet Sauvignon, with sweet, jammy red berries and only light tannins. The fruit has freshness, but the dominant character is sweetness, ripeness, a wine full of final juicy acidity.",Casa do Lago Grande Reserva,88,13.0,Estremadura,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,DFJ Vinhos

134581,Argentina,"Dark fruit and leather on the nose seem fine, yet the palate is high-toned and starchy, with sharp flavors of cherry, plum and mushroom doing battle with severe tannins. And it's a touch saucy and salty on the finish. Imported by Victoire Imports.",,83,9.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Viento Sur

134583,Portugal,A very old wine which smells medicinal and tastes like sweet cough syrup. It's so concentrated as to be almost undrinkable.,40-year old tawny,83,120.0,Port,,,Port,Rozes
134584,Austria,"A hint of vinyl on the nose detracts from this wine's otherwise positive impression. White pepper and blackberry-blueberry flavors are carried along on a smooth mouthfeel, while supple tannins and a cocoa note chime in on the finish.",,83,19.0,Burgenland,,,Zweigelt,Gernot and Heike Heinrich
134585,Argentina,"Bright in color and jammy on the nose, with aromas of bubble gum and blueberry. Candied in the mouth, with flavors of sugary plum and cherry. More of a junior varsity wine; it shows some talent but needs more practice. Imported by Stanza.",,83,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Finca El Retiro
134586,US,"Dark purple, with mixed aromas of juicy plum, sawdust and clove that pick up hints of beet. A heavy hitter, the 15% alcohol is not apparent except in the big feel, matched by dry, rough tannins and a hint of sweetness. Dark berry fruit and beet flavors coat the mouth, and the wine finishes with a medicinal feel.",,83,28.0,Colorado,Grand Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Balistreri
134587,US,"Doesn't quite reach the potential of Merlot on Long Island, but still has aromas of vanilla, mint and red fruit.

Has fine weight and tannins, but gets greener on the finish.",,83,18.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Merlot,Ackerly Pond
134588,Australia,"Getting past the nose, with black pepper, pickle and lactic aromas, takes some doing; but once you do, the flavors are  fine.

134590,Australia,"Though this is the reserve-tier Chard, it seems simpler than the other Jacob's Creek offering. This one deals confection on multiple levels: It smells like glazed donut, and has a flavor not unlike lemon pudding. Soft and full, but missing some heft in the middle. Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.",Reserve,83,13.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Chardonnay,Jacob's Creek
134591,Australia,"This is a good casual sipper without a lot of kick, but one that gets the job done. Offers lemon drop aromas and faint pineapple and chalk flavors. Imported by VB Group.",Bin 222,83,9.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Chardonnay,Wyndham Estate
134592,US,"A bit flabby and sweet, not to mention heavy on the oak, this is the sort of Pinot that has many fans for its full-bodied richness. Yet it's over the top, lacking in delicacy and restraint.",Solomon Hills Vineyard,83,45.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Tantara
134593,Argentina,"Runs toward the sweet side, with fruit syrup and candied apple on the nose. Lemon-lime is the front and center flavor component, while the finish runs sweet and sour, with a sugary aftertaste.",Famiglia Bianchi,83,15.0,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Sauvignon Blanc,Valentin Bianchi

134595,US,"Has plenty of dry, extracted tannins alongside dark fruit, tree bark and vanilla notes. The mouth doesn't deliver as much, with moderate dark fruit flavors matched by green, stemmy notes. Finishes with chalky tannins.",,83,40.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Cabernet Franc,Raphael
134596,US,"Greenish-yellow in the glass, with aromas of tart tropical fruit, honeydew and bell pepper. Nice balanced, backed by firm acids. Lemon, lime and melon appear on the palate, then quickly finish.",,83,22.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Sauvignon Blanc,Raphael
134597,Argentina,"Flat and basic, with charred secondary aromas. Simple red fruit with rubbery tannins make for an average palate. Easy enough but hard to find anything special or exciting to go on about. Imported by Wine Source Selections.",,83,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,1919
134598,France,"Boasts assertive strawberry and lime aromas, but drops off a bit on the palate, courtesy of relatively low acidity.",Sabine,83,10.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Vin de Pays des Côtes de Thau,,Rosé,Bieler Père et Fils

134600,Argentina,"Floral and spring-like up front, but also smells too much like air freshener or dish soap. Plump pear and cantaloupe flavors are adequate, but the candied finish and heavy sweetness lean toward dull and heavy. Not bad but has faults.",,83,9.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Fantelli
134601,Argentina,"Starts hard and rubbery before opening to show more wood and toast than clean, approachable fruit. Kind of buttery and woody on the palate, where red fruit sits in reserve. Sort of lean in terms of flavor; limited. Imported by Oenophilia Imports.",,83,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Gouguenheim Winery
134602,Argentina,"Very oaky, with coconut and raw wood making up the bulk of the bouquet. Wood is the recurring theme throughout, with just a bit of dark fruit making an appearance. Very hard, tannic and tough.",Reserva,83,40.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Merlot,Joffré e Hijas
134603,Portugal,This wine certainly doesn't taste its age. It has more to do with sweet almond cookies and unbalanced spirit than mature flavors. Imported by Langdon Shiverick.,40-year old tawny,83,130.0,Port,,,Port,Quinta das Heredias
134604,US,"This wine has Muscat-like floral aromas as well as orange liqueur and vanilla, then turns toward honeyed peach nectar in the mouth, with hints of musk.

134607,Argentina,"Solid enough, with standard black-fruit aromas that show raisin but also adequate freshness. Black cherry is the dominant flavor component, backed by a finish that's decently textured and a touch chocolaty. Not great, but not bad for Tannat.",,83,9.0,Other,Cafayate,,Tannat,Quara
134608,Portugal,"A hugely, almost uncomfortably sweet wine with strong aromatics. It has some attractive acidity, but the sweetness detracts from any other character.",10-year old tawny,83,30.0,Port,,,Port,Cockburn's
134609,Australia,"Has an odd green aroma, like capers. On the palate, this Sem offers soft peach and guava flavors, and a green, herbal note. Doesn't taste very late harvest, either—especially compared to other Oz sweeties. Imported by Abarbanel Wine Company.",Kosher Late Harvest,83,16.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Sémillon,Beckett's Flat
134610,South Africa,"Chenin, South Africa's most widely planted grape, plays its role once again, this time in the lead with 48% Chardonnay supporting. Citrus on the nose, with strong vanilla accents, is followed by racy tropical fruits in the mouth giving life to the smooth, demure feel. Finishes with a bang, leaving grapefruit, papaya, vanilla, spice and a craving for another sip.",,86,8.0,Western Cape,,,Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay,Robert's Rock

134612,South Africa,"Mint, toast and spice are dominant on the nose, while the palate is laden with toasty, nearly overripe fruit. Retains some tropical fruit character, namely mango, and the oak is flavorful, if heavy handed. Imported by 57 Main Street Wine Co.",Reserve,86,18.0,Coastal Region,,,Chardonnay,Boschendal
134613,Spain,"Forward and a touch racy, with moderate sweetness on the bouquet. Runs juicy and tight, with fresh, almost tart raspberry and cherry flavors.

134614,US,"What a nice rosé this is, elegant, full-bodied and dry.

134615,New Zealand,"This consistent value performer is made specially for the U.S. importer by a winery whose “name” wine is imported by someone else. Too confusing? Try this: Winery A makes wine under the Winery A label and sells it for a premium price through Importer A. Then, since it has additional wine, it bottles more under Label B and sells that through Importer B. (No, I'm not going to spill the grapes and tell you the name of the winery in question.)

134620,Argentina,"Jammy and condensed to start with, but ultimately the nose checks in as unexpressive. Intense in the mouth but limited in its depth and scope. There's blackberry early and mocha late, but the feel is hard. Quite tannic and unyielding. It's one-third each Cabernet, Malbec and Merlot.

134622,South Africa,"Big in the mouth, with moderate acid, this Chardonnay got plenty ripe in the hot Stellenbosch sun. Yellow fruit flavors have a nice oaky touch, adding plenty of vanilla spice character. The nose is airy, with a straw-like character.

134625,US,"A little too big and extracted for finesse, this full-bodied wine is almost Rhônesque. It's dark, with cherry jam and mocha flavors, and is a bit soft and hot. Lots of new French oak piles the smoky, vanilla flavors on.",Lafond Vineyard,86,48.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Lafond
134626,New Zealand,"The 2004 vintage wasn't all that kind to many Pinot Noir producers at the northern end of NZ's South Island. Neudorf's 2004 Nelson bottling shows some herbal, beet-like notes on the nose, and the tannins and acids both have a slightly green edge to them. Still, there's ample cherry fruit and some mushroomy complexity to round it out.",,86,30.0,Nelson,,,Pinot Noir,Neudorf
134627,Portugal,"For a white wine from hot Estremadura, this shows admirable freshness, with apple, pear and nectarine flavors touched with hints of mint and graphite.

134628,Uruguay,"Bouza is one of the few Uruguayan wineries that's ready to compete on the world stage. This Tannat-Merlot blend is deep and dark, with saturated blackberry and dark plum flavors. It's a bit heavy and clumsy, with some chocolate on the finish.

134632,New Zealand,"Not overly rich or concentrated, this is a light- to medium-bodied Pinot with a hard, woody shell. Cedar hits the senses first, followed only slowly by modest cherry fruit and more and more wood spice. Still, it shows some class and a reasonably long finish. Try in another year or two, when the oak may be more integrated, but before the fruit falls away.",Reserve,86,30.0,Wairau Valley,,,Pinot Noir,Grove Mill
134633,Spain,"Here's a wine that rides heavy with smoked meat and cured ham aromas.

134635,New Zealand,"Refreshingly austere and flinty on the nose for a Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, this offering from winemaker John Belsham also shows some citrusy aromas.

Try after 2009.",Savoy Vineyard,88,55.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Barnett
134913,Spain,"Admittedly we are tasting this later than we'd prefer, but for an '07 it is still showing vital signs and attractive aromas of sugared pastry, candied apple and lemon-lime. The palate is mostly fresh, though not as lively as it probably was nine months ago, while the flavors of 7Up and peach are refreshing. Drink immediately or wait until the 2008 arrives.",Dona Rosa,88,25.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Adega Martínez Serantes

134916,US,"Rugged and robust, with flavors of grilled blackberries, plums and a meaty taste, like stir-fried ground beef splashed with soy sauce and dusted with black pepper. Fine with sausage-based pasta dishes.",Incredible Red,88,12.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Peachy Canyon
134917,Portugal,"Blending Alvarinho and Trajadura, oenologist Anselmo Mendes has created a deliciously creamy but dry style of Vinho Verde.

134918,US,"Real pretty strawberry fruit shows right away. The 20% Sagemoor vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend was finished in new Hungarian oak, which does add some assertive spice.

134919,Italy,"Here's a bright Friulano with a luminous golden color and intense aromas of honey, peach and passion fruit.

134921,Italy,"Year after year, this is one of our favorite Chardonnays from Northeast Italy. This year, however, there is an aromatic element out of place and the wine seems unable to deliver its bouquet with the same intensity.

134924,Italy,"Brought to us from the distant 1999 vintage, Cialla Bianco (a blend of Ribolla Gialla, Verduzzo and Picolit) demonstrates that white wines from Northeast Italy can age.

134929,Australia,"This is a burly, firmly structured Grenache evidently meant to age, which makes it a little tough to evaluate right now.

134930,US,"A World War II–era pinup, caught mid-salute with a glass of wine in her left hand, makes this one of the more eye-catching labels to hit the shelf this year.

134933,US,"Lush and fragrant, and happily and distinctively not tasting like a Washington Cabernet or Merlot, this is a bowl of rose petals and ripe cherries.

134936,Italy,"Cantarutti delivers a thickly saturated and concentrated Friulano with almost passito-like aromatic intensity.

134940,US,"A blend of various varieties, this red has a rustic feeling in the gritty tannins and briary flavors of wild berries and Asian spices. But it's not a simple wine.

135086,New Zealand,"This bright, cherry-laden Syrah features a fairly strong peppery component, but otherwise doesn't show that much in the way of complexity.

135087,Spain,"Having really liked this wine a couple of years ago, this vintage seems comparatively fierce and aggressive, which isn't to say it isn't hugely flavorful and aromatic. On the down side, it's residue-heavy and tannic, with full extraction and tannic berry fruit. Tough as nails; maybe it just needs a couple of years to settle.",,88,90.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Paixar
135088,Spain,"Opens with rich aromas of raisin, licorice, black plum and molasses that put it on the cusp of overripe. The palate is rich and gritty, with deep berry and molasses flavors.

135089,Spain,"Raspberry and plum aromas carry a mild floral, perfumed accent, while the palate is medium in weight, with good flow due to lively acidity.

135090,Austria,"With its pretty girl label, this is not intended to be serious. The Zweigelt is attractive, soft, with good berry flavors.

135091,Argentina,"Once you cut through the heavy, minty oak, there's a decent wine hiding in the folds.

135094,Argentina,"This colorful, clumsy wine shows glaring powdered-drink and candied cherry aromas and flavors, and while it's kind of scouring and rough it manages to make its mark via its juicy ripeness.

135100,Argentina,"Holds it together for the most part, but this isn't what you'd call a focused or interesting wine.

135102,US,"Ballentine continues to struggle with this bottling. It's more balanced than the '02, but still has a harsh, baked quality to the cherry-berry fruit. That accentuates the tannins, which feel hard and astringent.",Pocai Vineyard,83,22.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Ballentine

135104,Argentina,"Most of Bousquet's wines are enigmatic. They show some good qualities but also signs of overcropping and underripeness. That said, this wine is typical: it's scattershot in its delivery of green-infused berry fruit, tannins and wood. It's O.K. but never settles down.

135105,US,"Leather and tobacco on the nose and a tart, oaky spicy flavor profile make this Finger Lakes Cab a little tough to tame, but paired with a sharp cheese or heartier fare, it will round out nicely.

135106,Argentina,"Can't say that the heavy dose of oak on this wine is helping the cause. The nose is quite resiny and cloying, while the palate is creamy and full, but loaded with wood chip and vanilla flavors.

135109,US,"Really not a very likeable Syrah despite some tasty cherry fruit flavors. The problem is enormously high alcohol, 15.9%, that makes the wine hot, and a near absence of acidity, which makes it cloying. The imbalance makes the tannins astringent.",F Block Rodney's Vineyard,82,45.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,Epiphany

135124,US,"This is a bizarre wine. The alcohol is extremely high, and the fruit is enormously ripe, to the point of bananas.

The play of flavors, mixing red and purple fruits, toasted nuts, mocha, caramel, bark and earth, is exceptional. The detail is extraordinary for a wine with such high alcohol. The acids and tannins are seamless and fine, and the flavors extend into an unusual finish that suggests menthol and eucalyptus – not generally a character found in Champoux fruit.

They flood the mouth with potent flavors of blackberries, cherries, licorice and red plums, with a peppery, briary quality and a finish so softly sweet, it's almost chocolaty. Just yummy.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,92,50.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
135354,US,"Although this is the least costly of the winery's Pinots, it's a lovely wine.

135355,US,"This Syrah is hard and tannic now, and it will always be hard and tannic, but it's quite an impressive wine. So dense and layered, it reveals tiers of complexity with every sip as it airs in the glass. The flavors are of pure, ripe wild blackberries, with currant, coffee and tobacco notes, and sprinkled with crushed black pepper.

135357,France,"An intensely mineral expression of Sauvignon Blanc, crisp, full of citrus flavors, deliciously fresh, but also complex. The wine is concentrated into a steel spring of ripeness, ready to burst from the glass.",Domaine Gérard Fiou,92,22.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Henri Bourgeois
135358,France,"A rounded wine, very green and opulent.

135362,US,"There is a sharpness to the aroma, a pungent mix of pineapple and pine needle, that leads into a fairly light palate with lemon oil, citrus fruit and a hint of orange hard candy.

135375,US,"The 2006 vintage was not kind to Beringer's Cabernets, and this esteemed bottling is no exception. It's tough and gritty, the kind of wine that may have a future but whose present is not particularly acceptable at this price. Extreme tannins lock it down. Tastes almost old-fashioned.

It could come around after many years.",Private Reserve,88,115.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
135376,Spain,"Solid if a bit soupy and tomato-driven on the nose. In the mouth, there's a nice offset between herbal, red fruit characteristics, tobacco and black fruit.

135400,US,"An awkward wine. High alcohol can work in Zin, but not in this one.

The wine boasts very good structure and length on the finish.,,88,18.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,Sauvignon,Vigna Traverso
135444,US,"Very ripe, showing upfront grilled blackberry and black currant flavors with hints of violets and licorice, and a firm application of smoky oak. Shows a pleasingly dry, classic structure.

135445,US,"Sobra is Brazilian Portuguese for leftovers. It's a Bordeaux blend, but the recipe changes every year. This is very nice and drinking well, smooth with a nicely resolved mix of black fruits, smoky wood, pepper and a bit of bacon fat.",Sobra,88,24.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Tertulia
135446,US,"This is lighter in mouthfeel than the other Tertulia reds, but with tasty toast, vanilla and caramel balancing fresh red fruits. Despite its lightness, it shows a lot of flavor and persistence, and it should benefit from a bit more bottle time.",Les Collines Vineyard,88,35.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Tempranillo,Tertulia

135448,Italy,"This is one of those awkward but deeply intellectual wines that won't appeal to everyone. Made near Gorizia, the wine shows a deep amber color with cloudy residue. Intense aromas focus on caramel, resin, candied orange peel, butterscotch and other resinous-oxidized smells. It's bold and thick and the finish is both sour and tannic. Despite it all, there's something special here.",Bianco Kaplja,88,65.0,Northeastern Italy,Venezia Giulia,,White Blend,Podversic Damijan
135449,Argentina,"The nose is full of mellow raspberry and cherry, while the palate is fleshy and round, with blackberry and a touch of raisin. Plump, not edgy, and ready to drink, with coffee and mocha notes on the finish.",Organica,88,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Julia
135450,US,"The first two things you notice are how delicious the flavors are and how gentle the tannins are. Blackberries, cherries, raspberries and mulberries mingle with 80% new oak to provide a thrill of a palate experience. As for those tannins, they're as ripe and sweet as a hot vintage and modern viticulture can provide, but this wine should do all sort of interesting things over the next 10 years.",,94,70.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Craig
135451,France,"Based mainly on vines in Le Mesnil-sur-Oger, this impressive wine is superbly rich with just the merest hint of age.

135452,US,"Released after five years on the yeast, this is still a young, tartly aggressive bubbly. It is in fact by far the most acidic of Iron Horse's current stable of superb bubblies. But it's enormously rich, offering a wealth of subtle lime, peach, strawberry, toast and sourdough bread flavors that impress with both depth and length, as well as sheer class. Wonderful now, and should age effortlessly for six to eight years.",Blanc de Blancs,93,37.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse
135453,US,"This has picked up softness and a honeyed mouthfeel, as the chemistry of aging on the lees does its magic. The wine has a plush, creamy feeling, with the silky smoothness of a great sparkling wine. Flavorwise, it's all pears, limes, dough and cinnamon spice. Delicious now, and should hold and improve over the next eight years.",Late Disgorged Brut,93,100.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery
135454,US,"Great Chardonnay, exotically rich and complex. With the crisp, zesty acidity of Russian River in a cool vintage, the wine is impressively balanced despite its powerhouse flavors.

135455,Australia,"A relative bargain in the scheme of South Australian Shiraz, this is a cherry-picked selection from the Baker's Gully Vineyard. It smells like mint, vanilla and chocolate at first, then unfolds on the palate into something akin to thin mints with vanilla and blackberry sauces, topped with black olives and coffee—yet all in one harmonious, savory whole. Long, silky and mouthwatering on the finish, this is enjoyable now, but with the stuffing to last through 2020.",The Vincent,93,41.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Tapestry

It will age for many years.",Trockenbeerenauslese,93,49.0,Neusiedlersee,,,Chardonnay-Pinot Blanc,Nittnaus Anita und Hans
135457,France,"Made entirely from grand cru grapes, this is a beautiful wine, layering toast and ripe fruit with a proper minerality from the year. Flavors of honey, toast and nougat soften the aftertaste.

135458,US,"Gainey's regular '05 was a beautiful wine. This is more full-bodied, richer and higher in alcohol, and merits its reserve status. It's a young wine, opulent in cherries and raspberries that have a baked pie-filling warmth, and complexed with cola, sweet leather, figs, pomegranates and dusty Asian spices. Very delicious now, it should develop additional complexities over the next six years.",Limited Selection,93,44.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Gainey
135459,France,"Named not after the goddess of love, but the horse that Agrapart uses to plough the vines, this superb wine comes from 50-year-old vines, the clay   element in the soil giving richness, the minerality giving balance, lifting up the yellow fruit flavors with excellent acidity.",Vénus Grand Cru Brut Nature,93,120.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Agrapart & Fils

135461,Australia,"Nitpicking Europhiles might find this a touch warm on the palate, but it's a full-bodied, lusty expression of Australian Shiraz, with fruit that kaleidoscopically moves from raspberries to black cherries and on to blackberries, all the while graced with hints of peppery spice that echo elegantly on the long finish. Drink 2010–2020.",Savitar,93,59.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Mitolo
135462,US,"Royal Cuvée has turned into one of the most consistent buys in an upscale California bubbly, mainly due to the elegance that always marks the wine.

135463,France,"The 1996 vintage really brings out the minerality in a wine. This grand cru is still austere, very crisp, with some smokiness, apple-skin flavors and intense freshness. Give it another 5–6 years.",Cuvée Millesimé Grand Cru Brut,93,75.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Pierre Moncuit
135464,US,"One of the best Petite Sirahs of the vintage, this rich wine shows an impeccable balance rare in this variety. Everything's just right, from the smooth dryness and furry tannins to the succulent blackberry fruit to the long, cherried finish. Really a nice, full-bodied red wine.

135465,France,"This new release from Mumm is a selection from 12 of the best vineyards owned or run by the company. It is certainly a complex wine, finely balanced with layers of intense, mature fruits, very mineral in structure, and with the crispness of the acidity acting as a support to the citrus and vanilla flavors. Worth aging for another 4–5 years.",Cuvée R. Lalou Brut,93,140.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,G. H. Mumm
135466,US,"This bottling has got to be one of the most seriously underpriced Cabs in California. What you get is a firmly structured, tannic, complex 100% Cabernet, rich in currants and oak, that can proudly stand on the best table. Will take some age, too.

135467,Austria,"The Heiligenstein vineyard is a great one, and from this Willi Bründlmayer produces three great wines.

135468,Austria,"The Kögl vineyard is right behind the city of Krems, a steep schist slope facing the Danube river, perfect for Riesling.

135470,US,"Not many Merlots deserve time in the cellar, but this one does. Such are its mountain tannins that it's in lockdown mode, with a tough, astringent finish. But just below the surface are voluptuously ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries and mulberries.

135473,US,"Los Alamos is a Santa Barbara region that should have its own appellation, to judge by this and many other wines grown there.

135474,US,"This outstanding wine is a blend of 60% Merlot from Washington's Champoux vineyard and 40% from the Hillside vineyard in eastern Oregon. Beautifully integrated fruit flavors suggest pie cherry and ripe strawberry, with dusty herbs scattered throughout. The herbal notes are not at all bitter or tannic, so the wine has an elegance to it, and shows nicely developed and integrated flavors, with the muscular power that winemaker Peter Rosback knows how to coax from his grapes.",,92,36.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Sineann

135476,US,"Rugged tannins are front and center in this youthful wine. There's a wealth of complex wild blackberry, licorice, grilled meat, sage and white-pepper flavor, and the wine is impeccably balanced.

135478,US,"A brut-style Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend, this sparkler is really good, and easily worth its relatively modest cost.

Will easily stand aging through 2010.",Grand Année,92,30.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sparkling Blend,Mumm Napa
135479,US,"This wine starts out so acidic, it's almost sour. Then the intense lemondrop flavors kick in, followed by the lush vanilla-accented smoky new oak, and the chalky minerals on the finish, and suddenly, the acidity makes sense. It's Chablisian, built for the cellar. By sometime in 2008, everything should start to meld together, and this block selection could do amazing things over the next four to six years.",Bien Nacido Vineyard Block UU,92,32.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Foxen
135480,Spain,"For an affordable Priorat this wine isn't disappointing. The nose is a bit funky and gamy, but you'll also dig out mineral, leather and bacon notes that are pleasing.

135481,US,"This is one of the few rosés from this appellation that I'm aware of. It's a little full-bodied for a blush, but pretty good.

135483,Spain,"A zealous wine with sweaty leather, prune and leftover oak on the nose. The mouth is charged up and lively as the tannins and acids meet to boost cherry and raspberry fruit.

135484,Spain,"Murkier than ideal. The nose is heavy and earthy, and it's full of barnyard initially.

135487,Argentina,"This wine is always a bit waxy and heavy, as vanilla and baked-corn aromas are prominent.

135489,Spain,"Rusty in color, which is to be expected. The nose shows dried cherry, belt leather and cigar box, and at this point all seems dandy.

135505,US,"The aromas and flavors of dill overpower the underlying fruit here, almost masking the citrus, pear and peach flavors. This may be due to oak or something else, but it's offputting. Too bad, because somewhere in here is a very fine Chardonnay.",,84,19.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Chardonnay,San Simeon
135506,US,"Is it a dessert wine or a table wine? At 4% sugar, it's clearly sweet, but refreshing acidity and a light texture make it clean and vibrant.

135512,US,"Cosentino is one of Napa's most consistent Cabernet producers. The CE2V, a vineyard bottling, always shows vintage variation.

135514,US,"Constant produces intense red wines that are destined to age, and this one is no exception.

It's very good now, but will benefit from a few years in the bottle.",Klopp Ranch,93,48.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
135523,US,"As good as Clos Pegase's 2003 regular Chardonnay was, this is richer, more complex and more satisfying. It's an oaky wine, with buttered toast and caramel layers on top of tropical fruit flavors. Somehow, acidity pulls it all together, and the wine is balanced. Best now through 2007.",Artist Series Reserve Mitsuko's Vineyard,92,36.0,California,Napa-Carneros,Napa,Chardonnay,Clos Pegase
135524,US,"The winery's reserve Chard has a richly satisfying buttercream texture that frames ripe flavors of limes, peaches and pinepapples, ending in a spicy, honeyed finish.

135525,US,"Kirby Anderson, Gainey's longtime winemaker, has crafted this wonderfully rich, vibrant and expressive wine. Partially barrel fermented, but with no new oak, it has a creamy texture framing ripe flavors of apricots, peaches, lemons, limes and grapes. Drink it now for its youthful exuberance.",Limited Selection,92,20.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Gainey
135526,US,"What a track record Byron has achieved with this single-vineyard wine, despite the hassles of ownership change. The '03 continues the tradition.

Drink now.",Nielson Vineyard,92,40.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Byron
135527,US,"The vines date to the early 1970s, and the vineyard is on the valley floor near Calistoga. Winemaker Bruce Devlin worked at Boschendal, South Africa's first winery to barrel ferment Chenin Blanc. Dry and crisp, this wine shows wildflower and citrus flavors, and a sweet, green-pea note with an edge of toasted wood. Not only is this an elegant table white, it should evolve over the next five to seven years.",Pocai Vineyard Old Vines,92,14.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chenin Blanc,Ballentine
135528,Chile,"The surprise of the moment from Chile has to be this full-throttle keg of dynamite Cabernet. It's a cellar wannabe with credentials. First off, it's brilliantly ripe, with forceful black cherry, cinnamon and wood spice on the palate. Huge tannins, poking acids and a couple of floors' worth of depth make it praiseworthy. Imported by Cabernet Corporation.",Axel,92,20.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,La Playa

135530,US,"Dobles lías, “double lees,” tells you this is a leesy wine, and that slight sour-creamy flavor dominates. This is a wine you love or don't. I find it refreshingly dry and complex, not a fruit bomb, but a dry, elegant Chard, in which new French oak adds enriching notes.",Dobles Lías Don Miguel Vineyard,92,40.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
135531,US,"Here's the latest Mondavi Fumé in the frosted bottle. As always, it's super-dry and grassy, with kiwi, gooseberry, lemon and lime flavors.

135532,Italy,"Here's a Nero d'Avola (with a small percentage of mystery grapes) that delivers the goods year after year: cinnamon, vanilla bean, pine nut, curry spice and leather round off a deeply concentrated and layered wine that sees 16 months of new French oak.

135534,Chile,"The newest addition to the Terrunyo line is a single-vineyard Shiraz with high alcohol, ripe fruit and varietal correctness. The nose has some wild game and spice alongside big black-fruit aromas. The palate, meanwhile, is ripe as can be, with upbeat tannins and acidity. Huge but balanced. A winner.

135535,US,"I discovered Bella a few years ago and was glad to find a Zin specialist with a real commitment to vineyard terroir.

135536,US,"Madrona does a good job with mountain Zin, and for their anniversary they pulled out all the stops. The wine is exceptionally balanced, showing none of the excess that can mar Foothills Zin. Dry, delicious in spice, cocoa and berry flavors and rich in fine, smooth tannins, it's drinking well now and should be best in its vibrant youth. Try with a very fine steak.",30th Anniversary,92,38.0,California,El Dorado,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Madroña

135541,Italy,"A 60-30-10 blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Syrah, Carato is a vibrant, cheerful wine elegant aromas that recall the small berry fruit and blue flowers usually associated with Sangiovese. The wine has a clean and balanced delivery and ends with crisp acidity.",Carato,87,16.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Erik Banti
135542,US,"Nothing subtle about this big, ripe, oaky Chardonnay. It shows the tropical fruit richness of a fine Alexander Valley Chard, flamboyant in pineapple custard flavor, with a flinty minerality. The sweet overlay of smoky oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume.",Stuhlmuller Vineyard,87,32.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutcher Crossing
135543,Italy,"Braccale is a drinkable, food-friendly wine. That's because this wine's naturally tempered elegance means it won't overpower what you eat. It delivers aromas of sweet red fruit, toasted nuts and has a crisp, spice-driven finish.",Braccale,87,18.0,Tuscany,Maremma,,Red Blend,Jacopo Biondi-Santi
135544,US,"The winery has struggled with Pinot made from this warm, sunny highland appellation, which is more suitable for Zinfandel. Their '06 is a savory wine, dry and rich in cherries and oak, with a silky texture. But there's a heaviness that makes you think Pinot isn't the best grape to grow this far above the Anderson Valley fogline.",,87,27.0,California,Mendocino Ridge,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Greenwood Ridge
135545,Portugal,"A rich, intense wine, a definite step up from the standard Periquita, smooth and packed with sweet, ripe red fruits, the juiciness of the Castelão grape tamed by the wood polish.",Periquita Reserva,87,23.0,Terras do Sado,,,Portuguese Red,José Maria da Fonseca
135546,Italy,"Here is a masculine and robust blend of Sangiovese, Cab Sauvignon and Merlot that exhibits thick concentration and aromas of exotic spices, cherry, prune, plum, vanilla and Amaretto. The nose is gorgeous but the mouthfeel is less convincing, with firm tannins.",Tuscany,87,20.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Kirkland Signature
135547,US,"Soft and dry, this Mourvèdre has flavors of melted chocolate and cherries, with hints of Provençal herbs such as lavender and thyme.

135549,US,"You can taste the racy acidity and minerality of the cool Sonoma Coast in this silky, bone-dry Pinot. The cola, cherry, raspberry and spice flavors are pretty and polished. This is a good price for a coastal Pinot of this elegance.",,87,18.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sebastiani

135551,US,"When this hilly vineyard Cab first came out, it was very good, but quality has slipped over the years. The '04 is perfectly decent in oak-infused blackberry and currant flavors and rich tannins, and it may even improve for a few years.",Landslide Vineyard,87,34.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Simi
135552,US,"This zippy, fruit-forward wine opens with bright raspberry and pungent spice aromas, adding in milk chocolate streaks through a supple, medium-weight middle.

135554,US,"It's terribly hard to make an expensive, upscale Cab Franc that succeeds. The variety on its own tends toward cherry fruit simplicity. In this bottling, von Strasser has added Merlot and even Zinfandel to perk things up with dark stone fruit and tannic depth. It's an elegant, dry wine, but at this price, not in the same league as their fabulous Cabernet Sauvignons.",Marcellini Vineyard,87,75.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Franc,Von Strasser
135555,US,"You might think this was a big Pinot Noir, like a Santa Lucia Highlands, if you blind-tasted it.

135557,US,"Exciting, fresh and full of spicy, toasted undertones, this wine immediately calls for a food pairing of a richer seafood (think oysters, crab) or poultry.

135558,Spain,"This is Cáceres' bread-and-butter red Rioja, and the '04 is fruity, light and very approachable. The nose shows some cotton candy and other bouncy red-fruit aromas, while the palate is easygoing, fleshy and balanced by a beam of juicy acidity. Along the way, you'll pull out flavors of cherry, raspberry and a finishing note of bitter coffee.",Crianza,87,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Marqués de Cáceres
135559,Spain,"Superripe, such that it's medicinal and pruny. The nose reeks of reduced blueberry and cassis, while the palate is soft, low in acidity and full of ripe, dark raisin, prune and spice cake flavors. If you like a dense wine, this is it.

135560,US,"Tastes a bit forward and simple right now in cherry pie filling, raspberry tart, framboise and orange datenut cookie flavors, with a silky texture and fine, ripe tannins.

135561,US,"A racy, citric undertone and spicy toast beckon on this fun, fresh wine from New York.

135562,Spain,"A maturing wine with aromas of burnt leaves, dill, leather and shaded black fruit. It opens up on the palate, revealing cherry, raspberry and plum flavors along with ancillary vanilla.

135563,US,"This small production (200 cases) Pinot Noir is a mix of older and younger estate vines, a selection of lots given 22 months in 60 and 132 gallon French oak casks. It's still tasting quite young, sharp and chewy, with spicy fruit backed up against earthy tannins. Give it plenty of breathing time.",Estate Reserve,87,38.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,David Hill
135564,Spain,"Cepas Vellas refers to old vines, but what's most noticeable on this wine is the popcorn and cream that characterizes both the nose and mouth. In between the oak-aided folds there's melon, waxy papaya and banana flavors sitting on a plump, cushioned palate. It's a holdover from 2005, so drink it while you have it.",Aquis Celenis Cepas Vellas,87,18.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Fernando Diéguez Otero
135565,US,"This Pinot Noir, named for a particular soil type in the Willamette valley, is scented strongly of the lumber smell you get at a building supplies store. There is a simple but pleasing layer of strawberry/raspberry fruit hidden in the wine's core.

135568,Italy,"A blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, the 2003 Rovaio is surprisingly light and delicate considering the hot vintage that shaped it.

135569,US,"The tannins and the acids dominate this dry, fruity wine, locking it down and making it harshly astringent. It's hard to imagine drinking it with anything except the richest beef, because it would overwhelm more delicate dishes.",,87,18.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Tannat,Ursa
135570,Spain,"Neutral for the most part, with a slight citric pungency. Tastes like apple, spice and dried papaya, and the feel is round as opposed to zesty or angular. Lasting on the back end, with a final note of grapefruit.",,85,13.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo-Viura,Emina
135571,US,"Much like Apolloni's Olivia Vineyard Pinot Noir, this acidic, astringent wine seems severely constrained. The winemaking is solid, the fruit leans hard on tart red berries, but the wine has a hard shell around it. More bottle age might open it up.",Ruby Vineyard,85,32.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Apolloni
135572,Italy,"Floral and mineral tones emerge from the nose of this white wine from Sicily. Executed in an easy and fresh style, this crisp—and slightly sweet—wine would pair with tuna salad and fried calamari.",Herea,85,,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Insolia,Avide
135573,Spain,"A little rusty in color, with earthy, stemmy, baked fruit aromas mixed with a dose of dried leaves.

Finishes short and herbal, but with good feel and flow.",Care Crianza,85,20.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Tempranillo-Merlot,Bodegas Añadas
135574,Spain,"The nose shows buttered popcorn, toast and baked apple, while the palate is tangy and tastes of tart white fruits, green apple and toast. Has good flow and a cleansing feel to it. Not bad for an oaky blend of Viura and Chardonnay.",Becquer Blanco,85,18.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,White Blend,Bodegas Escudero

135578,Spain,"Floral, sweet and not the least bit complicated or strained. This is easygoing red wine for easy times. It's a bit candied and baked, but that's Garnacha from Central Spain.

135581,Germany,"If the first duty of an icewine is to be sweet, this satisfies that need. Its sugar is also reasonably balanced in this case by 10% alcohol and crisp acids.

135609,Spain,"Jammy and full of raisin, stewed berries and leather. Calling it ultraripe might be an understatement because it's nearly over the top in its heft, extract and tannin level.

135611,Argentina,"This new Patagonian winery is doing better with its reds. This SB is honeyed and slightly mealy; the palate starts out soft and chunky, with apple and peach flavors that are less than zesty and slightly oxidized.

135612,Spain,"Hits with force as well as notes of raisin and Sherry. No doubt this comes from a hot vintage, evidenced by the prune, brandied cherry and chocolate flavors.

135694,Argentina,"Candied fruit aromas lead to a hard, underdeveloped palate that houses tannin and oddly flavored raspberry notes. Not a lot else to say about it.",Finca la Daniela,81,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Familia Barberis
135695,Argentina,"Hot and earthy up front, with mocha-like aromas. The palate and finish are syrupy, and the wine ends in a pool of chocolate and berry extract. This is an example of why Argentine Syrah has not found its groove.",Valle Huarpe,81,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Bodega José Quattrocchi
135696,,"From first sniff to last, the nose never makes much of an impression; the wine has funk and generic chemical aromas but also your basic red apple and char. Pretty big and aggressive in the mouth, with snaggy acids and rough tannins.",Piedra Feliz,81,15.0,,,,Pinot Noir,Chilcas
135697,US,"Way too hot for a table wine, with prickly, unpleasant heat, the result of 16.1% alcohol and insufficient fruit.",Hampton,81,35.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,Epiphany
135698,Argentina,"What else can you say about this three-grape blend other than it's heavily oaked and doesn't have the fruit or complexity to handle it? The bouquet is like a trip through the sawmill, and the palate is akin to biting into a log.",Gran Reserva,81,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Telteca
135699,Argentina,"Flat and soupy, as if the life had been drained out of it. Barely acceptable, even with a big production of 40,000 cases.",Antigua Cava,80,6.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Familia Barberis
135700,Argentina,"Too funky, animal and vegetal to recommend. The wine has color and size but the aromas and flavors just aren't that pleasant. Tastes more like rhubarb and carob than fresh berries.",San Carlos,80,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Carlos Basso
135701,Argentina,"It's hard to understand why Santa Julia would want to make an oaked Pinot Grigio in Mendoza, but they did. And we find it as odd and difficult to get through as you might expect. The nose is nutty and full of popcorn, while the palate offers heady, honeyed apricot and peach flavors.",,80,8.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Grigio,Santa Julia

135704,Argentina,"Tan in color, with musky aromas. Flavors of cucumber and citrus alert you to the fact that this is Sauvignon Blanc; because nothing else really does. Overall it's a foxy, musky wine without much SB character.",Tunuyan,80,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Carlos Basso
135705,Argentina,"Quite green and on the verge of deserving the dreaded weedy designation, this Cab fails to show much ripe fruit character even if the mouthfeel is decent.

135707,France,"Dense and rich but also incredibly complex, long and elegant, this is a momumental Côte-Rôtie. It's darkly fruited and superripe, yet doesn't lose its essential sense of terroir, remaining marked by scents of pepper and espresso to go with the chocolate and cassis fruit. Velvety in texture, this is the one of Guigal's 2003 Côte-Rôties that demands a few years of cellaring. Drink 2010–2040.",La Landonne,99,450.0,Rhône Valley,Côte Rôtie,,Syrah,E. Guigal
135708,France,"This is breathtaking stuff, incredibly complex on the nose, where it features hints of vanilla, clove, cinnamon, cassis, pepper and asphalt. It would be a wine to sit and smell all day if it weren't so delicious to taste. Rich waves of cassis fruit cascade over the palate without losing complexity, buffered by incredibly supple tannins. The virtually endless finish confirms the quality. Drink now–2030+.",La Turque,98,450.0,Rhône Valley,Côte Rôtie,,Syrah,E. Guigal
135709,Spain,"The best new release in the Eguren family's collection of modern Rioja wines is this small-production, 100% Tempranillo.

Just over 300 cases produced. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",La Nieta,97,150.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos
135710,France,"Sure, this wine shows the effects of the hot summer in its slightly jammy raspberry flavors, but there's also incredible complexity to complement the fruit intensity—Asian spices, tea, pepper and meat, to name just a few nuances. It's all wrapped in a blanket of soft tannins, but stays fresh-tasting thanks to great minerality despite low acidity. Drink now–2030 or beyond.",,97,96.0,Rhône Valley,Côte Rôtie,,Syrah,Domaine Jamet
135711,France,"Chapoutier's top white in 2004 is this knockout cuvée parcellaire he calls De L'Orée. Aromas of truffles and honey burst from the glass, while the flavors lean toward peaches and toasted nuts. It's full-bodied and undoubtedly high in alcohol, but there's no trace of heat, and while it's broad and mouthfilling because of its size, it still finishes fresh and minerally.",De L'Orée,96,160.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Marsanne,M. Chapoutier
135712,France,"Le Méal is said to be the warmest terroir on the Hermitage hill, and thus it is no surprise that this bottling fared the best in the challenging 2004 vintage. Flamboyant, creamy waves of raspberry fruit flood the palate, bringing hints of meat, smoke and pepper along for the ride and developing lovely soft tannins on the caressing finish. Approachable now, but should age well through 2020.",Le Méal,96,202.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,M. Chapoutier
135713,France,"Chave's white Hermitage is even better than his acclaimed red in 2004. It's wonderfully toasty upfront, backed by layer upon layer of honeyed fruit that simply defies description. Yet despite the incredible richness, there's also tremendous focus and minerality, so that the wine never seems overly weighty, and it finishes with great length and intensity. Drink it now, or try it in 15 years; the 1991 is singing now at age 16.",,96,98.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Marsanne,J.L. Chave
135714,Spain,"As expected, the wine exhibits a dense black color, with mineral, burnt toast and dark fruit on the bouquet.

Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",El Puntido,96,57.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos
135715,France,"How can a wine be this hugely concentrated, yet remain supremely elegant?

135718,France,"From 50-year-old vines, this is Sorrel's top cuvée of white Hermitage, laden with scents of truffled honey and almonds. Yet despite that obvious richness on the nose, it's a bit more restrained on the palate than the 2005, with a more powerful structure and marginally less lushness. Not better, not worse, just different: longer on the finish, more tightly constructed and probably longer-lived.",Les Rocoules,95,140.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Marsanne,Marc Sorrel
135719,Spain,"The bouquet explodes with tobacco, leather, dry oak and waves of berry fruit. In the mouth, the wine sits comfortably on the tongue, with firm tannins offering structure to the bedazzling boysenberry, black cherry and cassis flavors. Long and intoxicating on the finish.

135721,US,"The Mendocino winemaker, Dennis Patton, who's a real veteran, made this extraordinary wine. A blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Grenache and Syrah, it's one of the best Rhône-style, field blend-type wines of the vintage, showing lush raspberry, cherry, cassis, gingerbread and herb flavors. A tannic taste of bitter almondskin rounds out the finish.",Coro Mendocino,92,35.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Red Blend,Fetzer
135722,US,"A delicious sparkler; shows the delicacy and elegance of a blanc de blancs at its California best.

Then it finishes long as well, folding in hints of spice cake. Drink now.",,92,25.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Inkwell
135724,US,"This is a complicated young Pinot; and while the parts are all pretty and polished, they haven't knitted together. Voluptuous flavors of cherries, cola, spices and cedar are wrapped into silky tannins, and the acidity is fine and brisk, but as good as the wine is, it seems unfinished, like the score to a symphony that has yet to be played.

135725,US,"The 2005 has been co-released with the 2006. The '05 is a better wine, probably due in part to the extra year of age, which has allowed the parts to come together harmoniously. It continues a multiyear streak of being one of the top Chenin Blancs in California. The main feature is dry acidity. It frames apple, citrus, peach and flower flavors, with a nutty, slightly bitter finish. Try as an interesting alternative to Sauv Blanc.",Ernesto Wickenden Vineyard Old Vines,92,20.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chenin Blanc,Foxen
135726,Italy,"A fine example of a Barolo, and a marvel considering the problems of the 2002 harvest.

135727,US,"Made primarily from Pinot Noir with a little Chardonnay, this has a subtle color of the first blush on a peach, and is fragrant and delicious.

135729,France,"The fact that this wine comes from the chalkiest of soils and is bone dry gives it considerable austerity.

It needs to age.",Minéral Extra Brut,91,60.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Agrapart & Fils

135731,Austria,"Despite its high alcohol, this wine manages to preserve its balance. That's because the Grüner acidity creeps through the weight. With his top wine, Ehmoser goes for a tropical fruit profile here, with mangos on top of vanilla and spice. There's structure too, which suggests this powerful wine could age for 2–3 years.",Aurum,91,38.0,Wagram-Donauland,,,Grüner Veltliner,Josef Ehmoser
135732,US,"This is a distinctive Chardonnay, with pea vine and peach, anise and apple mixing it up. It has a lovely, lifted elegance that keeps the flavors intertwined but allows you to experience them separately as well, and it carves a flavor trail through the finish that lingers sensuously. Could be the best CV Chardonnay ever from L'Ecole.",,91,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,L'Ecole No. 41
135733,US,"Well made, this is a sappy, snappy take on Syrah, with vivid wild berry fruit and lively acids. It snaps into focus right away, then slowly softens as it weaves through the palate, with mixed berries, rhubarb, plum and hints of citrus. The finish lasts a full minute, adding notes of black pepper as it fades. This is beautifully rendered and not overblown in any way, with the alcohol at just 13.5%.",Estate,91,35.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Smasne Cellars

135735,New Zealand,"The Saint Clair style usually features prominent herbaceous notes, but this special block bottling tones down that influence, instead relying more on melon, fig and mineral notes for impact.

135737,Australia,"Lush and creamy on the palate, this is wonderfully soft and enveloping, offering a hedonistic mouthful of black cherry fruit, yet not without ample complexity.

135739,US,"Many winemakers use Milbrandt fruit for their Syrahs, so it's no surprise that the brothers' own winery has a Syrah that stands at the top of the product line. There is precision and power here, with deep cherry and boysenberry fruit, tart acids that hint at lemon rind, a sharp peppery streak and a finish that somehow suggests chocolate and pineapple candy. Complex, muscular and delicious.",Legacy,91,25.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Syrah,Milbrandt
135740,US,"Just delicious, a blend of Syrah, Mourvedre and Grenache that shows how well Paso Robles can make these Rhône reds.

Finishes long and rewardingly dry.",,91,18.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,Minassian-Young
135741,US,"This is one of the biggest, richest Chardonnays that Rodney Strong has ever produced, and no wonder, as longtime winemaker Rick Sayre was assisted by David Ramey as a consultant. The wine has Ramey-esque proportions, gigantic in fleshy tropical fruit, caramel, vanilla cream, butterscotch and meringue flavors. It's so softly decadent, it's almost better as a cocktail wine than with food.",Reserve,91,30.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rodney Strong
135742,US,"This is pure Cabernet from one of Washington's oldest vineyards. Cold Creek is a hot site, and its grapes are scattered throughout many of the Ste. Michelle brands, often providing the core fruit. Here is the essence, a wine that opens a bit grudgingly, but has structure and concentration if you take the time to let it blossom. Dense cherry and cassis fruit is tightly wound with balancing acids. The use of new oak is restrained, but sufficient, and this is a wine that should age nicely for many years.",Cold Creek Vineyard,91,26.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau Ste. Michelle
135743,US,"So forward and appealing right now, it's hard to resist, but this could gain a little traction with a two or three years of age. It's polished in cherry jam and blackberry-pie filling, with earthy tones of coffee, figs, sage and cedar. The intricate tannins play nicely against the acidity, which gives it an upscale feeling.",,91,24.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Flora Springs
135744,Austria,"The epitome of aristocratic, full-bodied Riesling. This wine has all the rosehip and white flower aromas, followed by structured, fresh, crisp green pear and white currant fruits.

135745,US,"This Pinot is pretty extracted, but the flavors are addictively good, offering a cornucopia of raspberries, cherries, blackberries, tangerines and cola, with complex nuances of sassafras, orange Pekoe tea, cola and dusty spices. It's a little soft, but silky and rich in tannins, a classic Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir.",Pisoni Vineyard,91,55.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Roar
135746,US,"From the pretty pale, amber color to the long, distinguished finish, this is a great rosé sparkler. To begin with, it's dry, a point in its favor, while the flavors are subtle and complex. They suggest pink grapefruits, tangerine zest, a squeeze of white peach, vanilla, and the smoke and dough of oak and lees. With its low alcohol and very low pH, it's a balanced wine of great structural integrity.",Brut Rosé,91,26.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Sparkling Blend,Roederer Estate

135748,US,"This Cab-based Bordeaux blend has sizable amounts of Merlot and Cab Franc. It's quite a distinguished wine, classic in the modern Napa sense of softness and ripeness to the point of decadent drinkability. There's a sweet olive-tapenade edge to the blackberry, cassis and cherry flavors. The finish, believe it or not, suggests blueberry pie, fresh from the oven.",The Oracle,91,70.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Miner
135749,Austria,"Soft and finely perfumed, this is full-bodied Riesling, adding just a touch of sweetness to the pear and white currant fruit flavors. This is a great vintage of this wine, probably the best since 2002.",Langenloiser Steinmassel,91,30.0,Kamptal,,,Riesling,Bründlmayer
135750,Spain,"Meaty and composed, with an earthy nose that carries plenty of dark fruit and minty herbal accents. The palate shows clarity and density, but it's a touch gritty, hard and tannic.

135751,Portugal,"A big dense wine, as tough as the rocks that make up the Dão soil. Its fruit is certainly there, a welter of black berries and plums.

135752,Argentina,"Mildly raisiny on the bouquet. The palate is round and full-bodied, with blackberry and roasted plum flavors backed by smooth tannins and a chocolaty, savory finish.

135754,US,"The acidity is high in this vibrant Pinot Noir, giving it a tart, bracing mouthfeel. Then there's the fruit, suggesting mashed red cherries with the skins, anise, cola and black pepper.

135760,Argentina,"Ripe and big, with campfire aromas and black fruit. There's a bulky molasses and brown sugar element to this wine along with blackberry and creamy mocha.

135761,Italy,"This is a well crafted wine that opens with pristine and brilliant aromas of tomato leaf, basil, exotic fruit and sweetened lime juice.

135762,Italy,"Fragrant aromas of peach, spring flower, orange blossom and fresh almond shape this crisp white wine from northeast Italy.

135763,US,"Syrah dominates, happily, dialing in lovely peppery spice that enlivens the tangy red fruit. Again there is a chalky quality, as if some acidification was done, and the front end is better than the back. But this grower/winemaker definitely has some excellent Syrah to work with.",Mustang,87,28.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Airfield Estates

135767,Greece,"A blend of Xinomavro and Negoska varieties from the Goumenissa A.O.C in Greece, this wine displays a rich nose of wood, cola and red fruit. On the palate, fine-grained tannins and a spicy, dry, red fruit and wood profile mean the wine can age. The finish is long and aromatic. Pair with strong cheeses, roasted meats.",Filiria,87,35.0,Goumenissa,,,Red Blend,Boutari

135770,Spain,"Earthy black cherry aromas give this easygoing Rioja an honest and true nose. The palate is almost what you'd call flush, but on the other hand it's snappy and fresh, with commendable black cherry and plum flavors. With a touch of oak and mocha on the finish, it's a complete wine that should come across familiar.",Viña Zaco,87,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Bilbainas
135771,US,"With a smooth, silky texture, this Pinot has a certain appeal. The basic flavors are of ripe mashed cherries, Dr. Pepper, chocolate, anise and black pepper. One drawback is the texture, which is sharp, almost acetic. But then, it's a very young wine, and these things can resolve over time. Try sometime in 2010.",Viento Valle,87,55.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Barnett
135772,Germany,"This is a decidedly nonfruity Riesling, marked instead by aromas of petrol and featuring flavors of crushed stone, canola oil and lime. It's relatively light in body and close to dry, finishing long and citrusy. Try it with a seafood salad or smoked trout.",Hattenheimer Wisselbrunnen Erstes Gewächs,87,,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Baron Knyphausen
135773,US,"Here's a dark, rich, somewhat heavy Pinot Noir, of the type sometimes referred to as Rhône-like. It lacks vibrancy, but is very rich in red cherry pie filling, cola, oatmeal cookie, cocoa, vanilla and smoky meringue flavors. Drink now.",Three Vineyards,87,40.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Carr
135774,Italy,This Sauvignon opens with a lively color and offers broad aromas of exotic fruit and white flower. It's not as intensely aromatic as you would expect but it does deliver satisfying sensations of crispness and freshness to the mouth. Pair it with spicy Thai or Indian dishes.,,87,20.0,Northeastern Italy,Venezia Giulia,,Sauvignon,Bortoluzzi
135775,Italy,"Here's a well crafted Friulano with drying mineral notes that are backed by stone fruit, grapefruit and white flower. There's good complexity, acidity and structure here and the wine leaves a satisfying peach note on the finish.",,87,20.0,Northeastern Italy,Collio,,Friulano,Livon
135776,Argentina,"Among Argentine high fliers this blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat lacks a little. The nose is mildly stemmy and herbal, while the flavors of wild berry and cranberry are a touch reedy. Tannat and Petit Verdot are not commonplace grapes, and maybe that's why the wine seems sort of herbal and edgy despite having its good qualities.",Gala 1,87,40.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Luigi Bosca
135777,US,"A fine evocation of a Russian River Pinot from a good vintage. It's dry and silky and crisp, with rich flavors of cherries, raspberries, pomegranates, cola, cedar, cinnamon and pepper. Delicious. Drink now.",,87,38.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,La Crema
135778,Italy,"You'll like the freshness here that comes across as kiwi, grapefruit, honey and peach. And, you'll also like the texture and density of the wine, which manages to be firm without being heavy or flat. In all, this is an excellent example of the variety.",,87,20.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,Pinot Grigio,Le Vigne di Zamò
135779,Argentina,"Here is how you get Torrontés right. The nose sheds dusty lemon and apple blossom aromas, which are followed by lemon-lime and citrus flavors. The palate has solid density and stuffing, and the finish evolves toward orange and pineapple.",,87,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Sur de los Andes
135780,US,"Petite Sirah seems a curious choice to grow in one of the coolest AVAs in California. This wine is bone dry and tannicly acidic, with a deeply attractive, ripe juiciness that's like the essence of black currants and chocolate-coated cherries. The wine is very young, but so beautifully balanced. Good now with big rich meats, but should hold and improve through this decade and longer.",Estate Grown,92,19.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Petite Sirah,Wolff
135781,Chile,"A wine that's made only in top years, Viu 1 represents the best that Chile can do with Malbec. It's an old-vines heavyweight with a purple color, sweet coconut-tinged aromas, and luscious black cherry and baked plum flavors. It's rich, heady and wide. Moderately tannic but not so much that you can't drink it now. Imported by multiple importers.",Viu 1,92,50.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Red Blend,Viu Manent
135782,Italy,"Verdicchio grapes from the San Sisto vineyard are left on the vine until they have shriveled up and show signs of botrytis, or noble rot, and are harvested in late December to produce an impressive dessert wine with thick layers of aromas and flavor. The almond paste and honey backed by herbal notes and crisp acidity are simply irresistible.",Arkezia Muffa di San Sisto,92,65.0,Central Italy,Marche,,Verdicchio,Fazi Battaglia
135783,US,"You have to wonder if the winemaker, who sold to Allied-Domecq in 2004, decided to make his Pinots fruitier to appeal to changing consumers tastes. Maybe it was the very hot vintage. In any case, this is more in keeping with California's superripe Pinots than Farrell's formerly tight, acidic ones, with excellent results. It's deliciously drinkable, although perhaps not so ageable.",Rochioli-Allen Vineyard,92,65.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
135784,Portugal,"As a contrast to the great fruity straight Touriga Nacional from the same producer, this is a much drier, firmer wine. The tannins are very dry, packed with wood flavors as well as berry fruits and layers of acidity. A wine for aging, this needs a good 5 years.",Quinta do Alqueve Touriga Nacional Syrah,92,32.0,Ribatejano,,,Touriga Nacional Blend,Pinhal da Torre
135785,Italy,"This is a delicate, polished and graceful wine that paints one of the most attractive portraits yet of the Nero d'Avola grape. Although some have criticized the fact its alcohol has increased over the last few years (now 14.5%), I would argue that its power is well integrated within its multifaceted and well-composed whole. Imported by Vias Imports.",Santa Cecilia,92,43.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Nero d'Avola,Planeta
135786,Portugal,"Wood and Vinho Verde don't mix, say the pundits. They can, if the wood is handled as sensitively as it is here.

Imported by European Cellars.",Escolha,92,25.0,Vinho Verde,,,Loureiro,Quinta do Ameal
135787,South Africa,"From a famed Stellenbosch estate comes another fantastic vintage of the Estate red. A blend of Cabernet (53%) and Shiraz (33%), with Merlot picking up the slack, this awesome wine shows all that the Stellenbosch region can be. Nearly black in color, the nose is awash with clove, cinnamon and coffee notes that donï¿½t overpower the dark, plummy fruit. Its rich mouthfeel is loaded with dark plum and cassis flavors and sprinkled coffee grounds, ending in a long, earthy finish. Drink now and over the next 8 years. Imported by Vineyard Brands.",Estate Wine,92,46.0,Stellenbosch,,,Red Blend,Rust en Vrede
135788,US,"Almost as good as the '02 reserve, which costs three times as much, Peju's estate Cab is rich and complex and showcases Napa at its ripe, decadent best.

135789,US,"Pretty much a copy of last year, maybe a tad less opulent, this is a soft, balanced Cabernet that shows off Oakville's supreme ability to ripen fruit and tannins. It's a gentle, thoroughly dry wine, rich in black currant, cherry and mocha flavors, with a nice cut of acidity. Best in its youth, but should hold for 10 years.",,92,53.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Paradigm
135790,US,"Made white Bordeaux-style, with barrel fermentation in partially new French oak and aged sur lies, this vineyard bottling is always interesting, but the '04 is one of the best. It's rich and creamy, with complex flavors of Meyer lemon, ripe fig, honeydew, crushed pineapple and peppery spice. Yet for all that, it's quite dry. Don't overchill, or you'll miss the nuances.",Fig Tree Vineyard,92,16.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Quivira
135791,US,"From a new winery that uses estate grapes that fall outside of any appellation besides the countywide one, this big, dry Syrah is very appealing. It's Northern Rhône in style, with cherry and blackberry flavors laced with leather and herb  otes, and the tannins are sizable. This is a wine to watch. Drink now through 2007.",,92,48.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Bugay
135792,US,"As good as this wine is now, and it's very satisfying, it possesses enough integrity for the long haul. It's light in color, like a Burgundy, and silky, with complex cherry, mocha and oak flavors that are edged with fine, dusty tannins. It will hold and improve for a decade, peaking around 2009.",Ryan Vineyard,92,40.0,California,Mt. Harlan,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Calera
135793,US,"This is Pet in all its full-bodied glory. It's a dark, rich wine, stuffed with enormous plum, black currant, coffee and bitter chocolate flavors that finish absolutely dry. Despite the size, it achieves balance and harmony. This is one of the best Petite Sirahs I've had this year. Good now, and should hold for at least a decade.",Jardine,92,26.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Petite Sirah,Vina Robles

135796,Chile,"One of the more legendary wines from Chile, one we look forward to reviewing. The '03 model is almost mossy and beet-based on the nose, but give that denseness a pass and head to the luscious black cherry and licorice that layers the palate.

135798,Italy,"Elsewhere in Italy, 2002 was considered too soggy for quality grapes, but not in Sicily.

135799,Chile,"A huge expression of Chilean Cab, which if you know the wine, is to be expected.

135800,US,"I've liked Galante's Blackjack Cab for its balanced ageworthiness, one of the few south-of-San Francisco Cabs you can say that about. This vintage, the wine is big in fruit but tight in tannins and acids. Although decanting will soften it and a good steak will improve it, it's best left alone for at least a year, and should hold for the rest of this decade.",Blackjack Pasture,91,60.0,California,Carmel Valley,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Galante
135801,US,"This beautiful wine is the quintessential Alexander Valley Cabernet. It's soft and melted in texture, a gentle but complex wine with enormously rich blackberry, cassis and oak flavors.

135803,US,"Shows the deft Phelps touch in the softly complex texture whose tannins are just as velvety as they come, and the ripe, pure fruit.

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Casa Barranca
135805,US,"After years of buying grapes, Merry Edwards finally has her own vineyard in the Sonoma Coast.

There's a sugary sweetness on the finish.",Meredith Estate,91,48.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
135806,Italy,"The nice thing about Planeta's dessert wine is that it lacks the aromatic overstatement that Sicily's sweet wines are famous for.

135813,Portugal,"Altano, a table-wine project of the Symington family, famous for their various Port houses (among them, Dow's, Graham's and Warre's), takes a two-pronged approach to marketing. A pricier Reserva offers greater richness and texture along with hints of oak, but while the entry-level Altano lacks the rich texture and density, it offers good value.

135818,US,"An interesting wine, different from anything you've tasted in more familiar varieties. The wine is high in acid, creating a peppery taste behind the smoky, citrus and dried herb flavors.

135819,Spain,"Grapy and granular smelling, with heavy, raw aromas that lack finesse and agility but offer plenty of thump.

135820,Spain,"Typically dry and leathery, with only modest red-fruit aromas. It's light to medium in weight, with punchy acidity pushing clean but thin cherry and plum fruit.

135854,Spain,"Earth, leather and tomato are accents to the dry, lean bouquet. The wine is expectedly juicy and tight, with snappy raspberry and cherry flavors.

135855,Italy,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, the wine boasts mineral elements that are backed by dried herbs, spice, meaty black fruit and coffee bean. The Cabernet Sauvignon component is obvious, and a bit too green, but not out of balance.",Fortulla,87,,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Casale del Mare
135856,France,"A rich wine that shows plenty of berry fruits, supported by some dry but dusty tannins.

135859,Israel,"Draws you in with its brilliant ruby color and assertive bouquet of dark plum, black cherry and berry nuanced with menthol and dirt.

135860,Portugal,"This is Casal Branco's branded wine, designed to be drunk young. And that's exactly how it tastes, with bright, lively fruit, soft tannins, a very light vegetal hint, and a soft, almost jammy aftertaste. Highly enjoyable.",Terra de Lobos,87,7.0,Ribatejano,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Casal Branco

135863,US,"Fans of Barbera will find the hard acids and thick tannins they love in this rustic Italian variety.

135874,US,"So ripe and fruity, it's almost too much of a good thing. Detonates on the palate with blasts of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, cola and cinnamon spice. Feels too soft, and could use greater dryness and structure, but it's a good BBQ sipper.",Zen Ranch,84,24.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Bianchi
135875,US,"Dry and clean, but this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend shows a surprising sharpness and hardness for a wine from this vintage, at this age. The black currant flavors are buried by tannic astringency. Doesn't seem likely to age.",,84,48.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Meritage,Kings Mountain
135876,US,"Very dry, very tannic and austere, this southern Rhône-style blend isn't offering much now beyond the astringency.

135879,US,"Too oaky, with vanilla and caramel aromas and flavors the main thing, and fruit only secondary. If you try hard you'll find blackberries and kirsch. On the plus side, the wine is fully dry, with lovely Napa tannins.",,84,18.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Twenty Bench

135895,US,"A disappointing wine. Tastes frankly unripe, with a vegetal undertow to the blackberries and cherries.

135928,Spain,"This wine is Cáceres' attempt at a modern (yet for the masses) Rioja, and frankly it's not working. The bouquet is nothing but an avalanche of coconut and butter, which stems from the barrel regimen the wine goes through. And the palate is loud, chunky and clumsy.

It's developing a toasted cashew and hazelnut character, and the pineapples are transmogrifying to chewy dried fruits and even Christmas fruitcake.

135945,South Africa,"This evolving Bordeaux blend offers beautiful aromas of blackberry, anise and spice, followed by a full, complex mouth of tobacco, cedar, black fruit and spice. Lingering finish.

135946,US,"Ultrarich and forward in fruit, and what's wrong with that? Floods the palate with pie filling flavors of cherries and raspberries, with a rich coating of oak that adds vanilla, buttered toast and caramel. The richness is balanced with crisp acidity.",Dutton Ranch,91,40.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sequana
135947,US,"Like all of Reverie's 2007 reds, this one's super-tannic. In fact, it's one of the hardest, most astringent Napa Cabs on the market. Still, it has a rich core of blackberries and currants, with lots of smoky oak, and the spicy fruit lasts a long time on the finish. A good sign for cellaring. Try after 2013.",Estate,91,65.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Reverie
135948,US,"Here's a beautifully lush, rich Pinot Noir. Made in a silky, drink-me-now style, it has flashy flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and sandalwood.

135949,Italy,"There are interesting aromas here of cherry, chocolate, rhubarb, cola, wet earth, forest floor and dried violets that make this Brunello Riserva a bit out of the ordinary. In fact, it's loaded with personality and charm and its mouthfeel is sharp, tonic and raw with a decisive root beer or balsam like finish.",Riserva,91,65.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Ventolaio di Fanti Luigi
135950,US,"You have to look closely at the back label to see that this is sourced from the outstanding Boushey Vineyard in Washington's Yakima Valley. But there is no doubt once you taste the rush of blueberry/blackberry fruit, swathed in smoky meat, bacon fat, dried tobacco and composted earth flavors. Incense aromas weave through, with firm acids holding the wine in focus.",,91,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Verve
135951,US,"Full-bodied, it leans into stone fruits and light tropical.

135952,Portugal,"Broadened by spicy wood, this is a smooth, rich and opulent wine. It has sweet plum and black cherry flavors to go with its dense texture.

135953,Italy,"Here's a Brunello Riserva with a delicate, feminine nose that recalls elements of forest fruit, pressed violets, cherry cola and dried herbs.

135954,France,"Made from old vines in a single vineyard, very intense even in its youth. It has a smooth, creamy texture over a core of flint and herbaceousness. It gradually builds, offering green and white fruits and vibrant acidity. This is a beautiful wine.",Clos Paradis,91,23.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Fouassier
135955,Italy,"Fattoria dei Barbi's 2005 Brunello opens with a ripe, saturated ruby color and thick aromas of black cherry, tobacco, leather and a playful touch of exotic spice. The wine needs time to integrate and another three years of cellar aging should do the trick.",,91,45.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Fattoria dei Barbi
135956,US,"A very interesting Chardonnay, and easily worth the price. It was fermented in 50% new French oak, which gives it a creamy, smoky richness, while the underlying fruit flavors are ripe and rewarding, suggesting pineapples, Asian pears, green apples and Meyer lemons. A beautiful, complex and balanced wine.",Director's Cut,91,20.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Francis Ford Coppola
135957,US,"Shows tremendeous richness and impressive weight along the lines of a Chardonnay, although the flavors are lighter and more refined, suggesting tangerines and Meyer lemons. Brisk coastal acidity provides brilliantly bright balance. Very fine as a more food-friendly alternative to many Chardonnays.",La Encantada Vineyard,91,28.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Blanc,Alma Rosa

135963,Italy,Here's an easygoing Franciacorta rosé sparkling wine with a bright pink color and spicy notes of white pepper and toasted almonds. The wine would make a great aperitivo choice or could pair with white meat with buttery vegetables thanks to the natural acidity.,Brut Rosé Millesimato,88,,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,Le Marchesine
135964,Australia,Toned-down aromas of blackberry and mocha lead to a palate with a firm structure of well-defined acidity and gripping tannins.

135965,US,"A bit of a fruit salad of a Pinot Gris, with pineapple, banana, mango, white peach and jicama all in the mix.

135967,US,"A blend of Marsanne, Grenache Blanc, Roussanne and Viognier. It's bone dry and zesty in acidity, showing an austerity of flavor that emphasizes minerals over fruit. There's enough Meyer lemon and lime zest to satisfy. Sleek and elegant.",Cuvée Papou,88,28.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Rhône-style White Blend,Demetria
135968,Australia,"The nose here is on the subtle side for a Viognier, with tones of macadamia and vanilla wafers. Meanwhile, the palate is vibrant and refreshing, with orange flower and musk accents, winding down to a limoncello finish. The lush texture of this wine suggests serving as an apéritif. Drink now.",,88,13.0,Victoria,Central Victoria,,Viognier,Four Sisters

135970,Spain,"Dense and spicy on the nose, with tobacco, baked fruit aromas and dry, woody notes.

Drink now through 2013.",Finca Monasterio,88,45.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Baron De Ley
135971,Italy,Adami's Bosco di Gica is among our favorite Brut Proseccos. The wine is delicate and feminine with drying mineral tones followed by plush fruit and floral tones.

135974,Spain,"A touch gritty and baked on the nose, and that ripe character persists throughout this semimodern Ribera wine. Along the route there's raisiny notes, baked plum flavors and oak-driven vanilla and spice. On the finish, vanilla is the lasting flavor.

135976,Germany,"This wine overdelivers for its pale garnet color. There's loads of sweet cherry fruit along with mocha and caramel character, all set in a bed of soft tannins.

135977,US,"This is Zinfandel on steroids, which is the Wilson house style. The wine is dry, full bodied and very high in alcohol, approaching 16%. Yet it's zesty and exuberant, with a wealth of blackberry, currant and pepper flavors. Distinctly Californian and Dry Creek Valley, it's a fine example of its type.",Sawyer Reserve,88,44.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wilson
135978,US,"A good, rich, supple Cabernet, nicely dry and silky, with a pleasant, medium-bodied structure.

Very enjoyable for drinking soon.",Estate,88,48.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sawyer
135979,Germany,"A less fruity take, with mineral and kerosene dominating the nose and a wet slate thread running through the exquisitely crisp palate. Spring flowers and honey notes soften up the finish. Try with Thai noodles.",Ockfener Bockstein Spätlese,88,20.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,St. Urbans-Hof
135980,US,"Made in the modern, ripe California style of exceptionally ripe fruit, accented with strong oak.

135982,Italy,This is an excellent expression of Prosecco from one of our favorite producers. Adami's Extra Dry is a light and feminine wine with a beautiful embroidery of apple and honeysuckle.

135984,Italy,"Here's a classic Brut sparkling blend (80-20 Chardonnay and Pinot Bianco) that renders a soft, creamy feel thanks to its fine perlage and dense body.

135986,US,"This is a different style than past vintages of Freedom Hill, with less tannin and alcohol. Cranberry fruit flavors are augmented with some pretty whiffs of incense, but it feels a bit simple in the mouth, and turns slightly chalky through the finish.",Freedom Hill Vineyard,88,50.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Ken Wright

The long finish winds up on a nutmeg note. Drink now.",Les Alouettes Lerchenberg,88,35.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Marc Kreydenweiss
135989,US,"Lots of honey is the first impression; this is under 10% alcohol and over 5% residual sugar. Nicely balanced, it still has enough acidity to put a little tartness in the midpalate. The fruit is pretty and the honeyed flavors seductive; it's not quite sweet enough for most desserts, but a fine apéritif.",Sweet P,88,22.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Riesling,Brooks
135990,US,"No doubt about it, this is a big, lusty Pinot Noir. From a low-production parcel of the estate, it routinely produces immensely concentrated wines. The winemaker's challenge is to give balance and harmony to grapes of this heft, and here, Iron Horse has it figured out. Dry and enormously ripe in cherries, black raspberries, cocoa and cola, it's good now with lamb chops, grilled steaks and similar upscale fare, and should soften and improve for five years.",Thomas Road,95,70.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Iron Horse
135991,France,"Wonderfully aromatic and complex, blending floral notes with mineral scents, bold cassis fruit and cracked pepper. This is full-bodied and muscular on the palate, the only one of Chapoutier's 2004s that really demands cellaring. Drink 2010–2020.",L'Ermite,95,250.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,M. Chapoutier
135992,France,"For white Hermitage, this is tight and minerally, with more structure than Chapoutier's other microcuvées and possibly more aging potential. There's a bit of truffle on the nose, but it's not so exotic as the De L'Orée, nor so rich and fat as Le Méal. Finishes with tremendous length and minerality.",L'Ermite,95,260.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Marsanne,M. Chapoutier
135993,Spain,"Classic in color, and backed by aromatics of lavender, graphite and pure blackberry. This is not overly weighty, as the acidity keeps it pointed and pure. There's a lot of elegance and balance to this wine; a perfect example of how to blend multiple vineyards into one excellent whole.",Pagos Viejos,95,95.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Artadi
135994,Spain,"Masculine and heady stuff, as leather, espresso, smoked meat, mocha and intense blackberry aromas set the stage for an intense, driven, structured palate that's full of coconut, vanilla bean, cocoa and pure plum and berry. A serious nuevo classico Rioja if there ever was one.",Altos de Lanzaga,95,105.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Telmo Rodríguez
135995,Spain,"What a superb combination of new oak, leather, mineral, mocha and berry fruit this wine delivers. It's a giant, with a ripped palate of upfront boysenberry and then coffee and vanilla in support. All the power, precision and other attributes of modern Rioja are on display. Best in a few more years.",Finca El Bosque,95,145.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
135996,Spain,"Full and ready, this fabulous wine from Rioja Alavesa sets the bar very high for any of its Vanguardia co-runners. Gloria hits hard with bacon, tire rubber, tobacco and pastry crust aromas, but also pure dark fruit. Then it's wave after wave of boysenberry and crisped brown sugar flavors prior to a finale of heady European chocolate. Need we say more? 750 cases produced; best now through 2011.",Gloria de Ostatu,95,75.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Ostatu
135997,France,"Delas's cuvée parcellaire is a rich wine that's almost syrupy in its concentration and tannic strength. But this definitely has plenty of fruit for balance, mixing cassis with black olive, espresso, cinnamon and clove. Not quite as rich as the '03, but still a classic, with great persistence on the finish. Best after 2015.",Les Bessards,94,128.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,Delas Frères
135998,France,"This was Chapoutier's initial microcuvée of Hermitage, bottled for the first time in 1989. The 2004 version is smoky and gamy, accented by pepper and a hint of rhubarb, but lush red fruit flavors take over on the palate, gliding easily across in a creamy mass that turns chewy on the finish. Drink 2010–2020.",Le Pavillon,94,225.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,M. Chapoutier
135999,US,"I have not been impressed by this bottling in past vintages, but the '05 establishes a new benchmark. Just exactly why is hard to say. Yields were exceptionally low in this long, cool vintage, and lots of new French oak frames dramatically rich, ripe flavors of mashed cherries and raspberries, sprinkled with cinnamon, a drop of crème de cassis, and a pinch of white pepper. The depth and length are beautiful.",Toulouse Vineyard,94,40.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
136000,France,"Intoxicatingly fruity and forward on the nose, this wine—a blend of Le Méal and Les Greffieux—follows up with rich layers of black fruit. It may lack a little of the minerality found in other parts of Hermitage, but this is immensely seductive stuff—maybe the Pomerol of Hermitage?",Le Gréal,94,145.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,Marc Sorrel
136001,Portugal,"This is the greatest of the quintas planted by Dona Antonia Ferreira in the 19th century. It is in the Douro Superior, the driest, most remote part of the Douro.

136002,Spain,"Plant-by-plant fruit selection leads to intensity, concentration and structure. Aro shows gripping tannins and juicy acidity, and overall it reeks of power and precision.

136003,France,"Rich, creamy and lush, this is like no other Clape Cornas before or since. Jammy raspberry fruit coats the palate, yet without seeming simple or heavy because there's also a remarkable sense of minerality and balance. Long on the finish, buffered by soft tannins. As this ages, expect to see some of the jamminess recede and more of the minerality emerge. Drink 2010–2025, possibly longer.",,94,82.0,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Syrah,Auguste et Pierre-Marie Clape
136004,France,"A top-notch effort from a difficult vintage, Chave's 2004 red Hermitage is a complete wine: complex and balanced.

Drink 2010–2025.",,94,98.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,J.L. Chave
136005,France,"Explosively rich and unctuous, this verges on being fat and overblown, then takes a few mincing steps back from the edge.

136006,US,"They pulled out their best for their birthday, and the result is a spectacular wine. Dense and concentrated in enormously complex cassis, black currant, cherry pie and cedar, it shows the dryness and firm tannins of a fine young Cabernet. Easy to predict a good lifetime ahead. Give it a year to resolve, and then should develop slowly for another six to eight years, at least.",20th Anniversary Vintage,94,95.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Livingston Moffett
136007,Portugal,"Dark, dense and concentrated, with power and elegance. But somehow this complex wine also shows restraint and style. It has much to do with the pure richness of the fruit (from 90-year-old vines) as the acidity which lifts and restrains the power.",Vinha Maria Teresa,94,150.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Crasto
136008,France,"Named after Alphonse Jr's father (Edmond Alphonse), this is the top wine from the Mellot estate. With its extra bottle age and wood flavors this is not typical Sancerre.

136009,US,"Dry and distinctly wild in brambly, briary berry fruit and spice. At first this Zin feels rustic, with a sandpapery grip and fresh, juicy acids.

This is great Zinfandel.",Lone Redwood Ranch,94,25.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
136010,Spain,"Only a select portion of a prized 30-year-old vineyard gives fruit to the wine named after the Eguren brothers' great grandfather.

136012,Spain,"One half of the wine is lush and opulent, the other juicy, fresh and pulsing with the essence of old-vines Rioja fruit. So for every note of molasses, burnt toast, chocolate or baked berry pie, there's a twinge of acidity, a spike of tannin and a dollop of earthy terroir. Tempranillo with 15% Graciano. 500 cases made.

136013,France,"This bottling from Guigal's own Hermitage holdings is incredibly rich and ripe (15.5% alcohol). In fact, it comes dangerously close to being overblown before the syrupy cherry fruit is reined back in by underlying spice and minerality. Expect that minerally edge to assert itself more with time in the cellar, making this a wine worth revisiting in 10 years' time.",Ex Voto,94,450.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,E. Guigal
136014,US,"Sacrashe is a great vineyard, technically in Rutherford but really in the Vaca Mountains, 750 feet high east of the Silverado Trail. Its Cabernets always are balanced and intense. Surh Luchtel has produced an oaky Cab defined by tight tannins, and although they're of the sweet modern kind, this classic, balanced, black currant-rich wine is one you want to cellar for five to eight years.",Sacrashe Vineyard,93,55.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Surh Luchtel
136015,Spain,"Slightly tighter and more complex than previous years, this single-  vineyard wine delivers a ton of spice and herbs on a masculine bouquet and palate.

Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",San Vicente,93,57.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Senorio de San Vincente
136016,US,"The most important aspect of this wine is acidity. Without it, it would be just another mushy, chocolate- and blackberry-flavored wine. With the crispness, it achieves real balance, and lets the palate discover additional complexities of sweet, smoky leather, mushu plum sauce and a salty tang of blood.",Stagecoach Vineyard,93,51.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,Palmeri
136017,Spain,"This is yet another magnetic example from the Eguren stable that includes El Puntido, San Vicente, Finca El Bosque and the many Sierra Cantabria wines. It's a racy, red-fruit dominated Tempranillo with raspberry, plum and cassis flavors accented by firm, almost blazing acidity. It's definitely tighter and more compact than the more generous, richer 2005 La Nieta. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",La Nieta,93,145.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos
136018,US,"Practically overflows with lush, ripe fruit—mainly cassis—but that richness is kept in classic balance by the dusty tannins on the finish.

136019,France,"This ratchets up the intensity from Voge's other Saint-Pérays, bringing waves of toasty, mealy and citrusy aromas and flavors. It seems almost floral on the nose, yet is authoritatively weighty on the palate. It's powerful, yet crisp, with a long, velvety-textured finish. Delicious now, but should hold well.",Fleur du Crussol,93,52.0,Rhône Valley,Saint-Péray,,Marsanne,Alain Voge
136020,Australia,"This is a big, loud Shiraz, bursting with blackberry fruit and scents of cola, vanilla and toast. The flavors favor blackberries but also blend in hints of fruitcake and spice that easily conceal its 14.9% alcohol. Long and lush on the finish, this is delicious now but should also hold at least five years.",The Prophet,91,30.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Chapel Hill
136021,France,"With its highly mineral aroma, this is almost like smelling chalk. It's an austere wine, with high acidity, crystal clear on the palate, full of grapefruit flavors and flint texture. Age this wine at least 4 years.",Blanc de Blancs,91,50.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Delamotte
136022,US,"This has a buttery, creamy softness that belies the usual hardness of Washington Cab.

136023,US,"This wonderfully rich wine combines the best of all three varieties to produce a complex white. It shows rich green apple, pineapple jam, superripe apricot, honeysuckle and smoky oak flavors, and while it's tremendously honeyed on the finish, it is basically dry. Crisp acidity, probably from the Carneros Chardonnay, provides needed balance.",Blend 23 Sauvignon Blanc - Viognier - Chardonnay,91,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,White Blend,B Cellars
136024,US,"Packs plenty of powerful complexity into a dry wine that's a pretty good price. Made in full-Burgundian style, with barrel fermentation and lees aging, it's a rich, creamy wine packed with spicy tropical fruit and honeysuckle flavors. Try as an interesting alternative to an upscale Chardonnay.",,91,20.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Roussanne,Truchard
136025,US,"This is a Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, and quite a good one. It has a classic mountain profile of intense cassis, cherry and cedar flavors, with firm, astringent tannins. Decanting will help it soften, but you're better off cellaring this polished wine for a few years.",Special Blend,91,40.0,California,Napa,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Amicus by X Winery
136026,Austria,"The rare Roter Veltliner is almost entirely confined to the slopes of the Wagram. Here it gives a style that is fragrant, with aromas of hedgerow flowers and delicate roses.

136027,US,"Keller enters the big leagues with this marvelously layered Pinot Noir. For starters, it's delicious. Dry and crisp, the flavors are of ripe cherries, raspberries, tangerines, pomegranates and cola, with smoky, spicy complexities from new French oak. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, leading to a long, fruity finish. Best now and through 2010.",La Cruz Vineyard,91,40.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller Estate
136028,US,"The estate bottling is 100% Sémillon and tastes a bit riper and more peachy than the Columbia Valley bottling, though perhaps less nuanced.

136029,Austria,"This comes from a terraced vineyard that Josef Umathum revived in 2001. Here is an already impressive testament to the quality of the vineyard.

136030,Australia,"Not the biggest, blackest or most extracted Shiraz, this is a more elegant, complex example, boasting hints of violets and espresso on the nose, alongside smoky, meaty notes and plenty of berry fruit. It's fresh and not overly weighty, managing to seem light in weight without being light on flavor.",Eliza,91,39.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Shottesbrooke
136031,US,"Summers has been quietly perfecting Cabernet under the radar. The '04 continues a string of successful vintages. It's riper and more accessible than previous years, and rewards for expressive black currant flavors enhanced with lots of fine, smoky new oak. The tannins are so gentle, you can drink this wine now, but it should hold for a good six years.",,91,46.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Summers
136032,Italy,"Not your everyday Docetto, the nose is far more aromatic than the typical version, while the fruit takes a supporting role to the tarry earthiness of the more traditional main flavors, which follows through to a medium finish.

136037,Australia,"Although not indicated on the label, this is 100% Mourvèdre, bone dry and barrel fermented. As a result, it's not your typical fresh and fruity rosé, showing instead dark, complex flavors of cola, chocolate tree bark and earth.

136039,US,"What a great Zinfandel this is. It's lusty and hearty, just the way you want a Zin to wash down barbecue, but it also has balance and even elegance, despite the high alcohol.

136040,New Zealand,"A blend of Dijon clones 667 and 777, this wine offers intense aromas of cherries, root beer, cola and chocolate.

136042,US,"This is really solidly made and appealing wine, which nicely combines lush, chocolaty barrel flavors with penetrating Cabernet fruit.

136044,US,"Here's one for the cellar. You could drink it now, with a little decanting, but such is the structural youth that you'd miss this Bordeaux blend at its best. Rich and savory in spicy black and red currant, cherry and cedar flavors, the wine shows a firm tannic structure, with a crisp bite of acidity.

136045,France,"Wood maturation gives this wine roundness, despite its dryness. At the moment, it is too young, very vigorous, and touched by caramel.

136046,New Zealand,"Slightly grassy, gooseberry notes bring a hint of herbaceousness to this medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc, but the core is based around lively melon and grapefruit flavors.

Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",B,90,23.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Brancott
136047,Austria,"Power and rich, spicy creaminess are the hallmarks of this full-bodied wine. Tropical fruit flavors of mango and lychee are spiced up with nutmeg.

136106,Italy,"Rolling out the hits, Benanti delivers yet another Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio blend (80-20%) that tops the charts of Sicilian indigenous reds.

Imported by Vino Bravo.",Rovittello,90,33.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Etna,,Red Blend,Benanti
136107,South Africa,"This excellent Cab has a Bordeaux-like nose, with forest floor meeting meaty red fruit and oak. Big tannins offer great structure without overpowering, and the wine has enough acid to feel alive. Barnyard flavors show on the palate, accompanied by complex coffee and red berry. A juxtaposition of Old World structure and New World fruit—this is why South African wine can excel. Imported by Vineyard Brands.",,90,23.0,Stellenbosch,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Neil Ellis
136108,US,"In a time when so many Cabernets are hard to drink with food because they're overextracted, this controlled wine is a welcome find. It's dry, with the alcohol a modest 13.5%.

136110,Spain,"Although this wine has been favorably reviewed in the past, this vintage seems jammy and ponderous. The color is blinding and the bouquet reduced and jammy. The palate pours on monotonous boysenberry and blackberry, while the finish is granular. A specialty wine (only 250 cases made) that proves why Graciano is rarely made by itself.",Single Vineyard,84,95.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Graciano,Contino
136111,Portugal,"Weirdly floral on the nose, reminiscent of strawberry- or cherry-scented candles and somewhat akin to air freshener.

136112,Spain,"Chunky but also lively, with pungent, aggressive Sauvignon aromas of prickly fruit, grapefruit and greens. The palate is heavy and all about pink grapefruit, while the texture is thick.

136115,Spain,"Mildly green and brambly, with touches of tomato and raspberry on the full, sun-baked bouquet.

Settles late to show some fruit and subtleties.",Tinto Barrica,83,7.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Red Blend,Don Ramón
136116,Argentina,"Yellowish rather than pale in color, which indicates some overripeness that's confirmed on the chunky, apple-driven nose.

136127,Spain,"Quite a bit different than the bodega's Flor de Grealo prestige bottling; this wine is a touch stewy, with molasses and braised-beef aromas.

Pair this wine with light, vegetable-based appetizers.",Extra Dry,87,15.0,Veneto,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,,Glera,Bianca Vigna
136290,Spain,"A very pretty middle-aged wine that has at least another decade in it. At this point in time, the nose is still showing a lot of black-fruit aromas, while the palate is chewy, meaty and rich as it spreads out with ripe flavors mixed with touches of mushroom, truffle and vanilla. A fine Gran Reserva with equal bits of tradition and modernity showing through.",Gran Reserva,93,35.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
136291,US,"This is serious Syrah. It shows mountain intensity, with potent cassis, licorice, grilled meat, cocoa and gingersnap cookie flavors, enhanced by all the loveliness that fine new oak contributes to a full-bodied red wine. The tannins are strong and thick, but of the sweetly ripe type. Just lovely. Drink now and for the next few years.",Estate,93,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,Spring Mountain Vineyard
136292,France,"Alphonse Mellot Jr, the 19th generation of Alphonses to make wine at La Moussière, has raised his family's domaine to a new height. This is so evident in this super-rich, concentrated wine, but one that doesn't lose sight of its cool climate, chalk soil origins. So there's great opulence, but also a vivid green acidity that strikes right through the wine.",Génération XIX,93,61.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Alphonse Mellot
136293,US,"After a couple of off years, this bottling is back on form. The Porty edge is gone, and in its place is a gorgeously ripe wine with full control over the fruit. Raspberries, cherries, cassis, pecan pie, pumpkin pie, cocoa, gingerbread, cola, vanilla, Asian spice; the list goes on and on. Meanwhile the mouthfeel is pure velvet, the finish long-lasting. This is Dry Creek Valley Zin at its best.",Somers Ranch,93,30.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
136294,US,"After missing a beat in '04, the '05 reverts to the high quality of the '03. Made from Dijon clones, the wine shows a brilliant purity of cherry fruit, with rich, earthy complexities of mushrooms, forest floor, cola and balsam. Bone dry, it has an elegantly silky quality that cries out for the best foods. Best now and for the next four years.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,93,52.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
136295,France,"The 2004s at Ogier are tremendously successful, none more so than the family's top cuvée. The 2004 Belle Hélène boasts waves of creamy raspberry fruit framed by wonderfully supple tannins. Long-lasting on the finish, it's already delicious but should develop additional complexity through 2015.",Belle Hélène,93,199.0,Rhône Valley,Côte Rôtie,,Syrah,Michel & Stéphane Ogier
136296,France,"A big step up from Jaboulet's La Petite Chapelle, this is on a par with some of Jaboulet's past efforts. It's richly concentrated, yet nuanced, with notes of blood and mineral added to ripe cassis fruit and accented by hints of vanilla and spice. The tannins form an almost creamy texture in the mouth, and the finish lingers a good long time. Drink 2012–2025.",La Chapelle,93,215.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,Paul Jaboulet Aîné
136297,Portugal,"The top wine in the Quinta do Portal range is in its second vintage. With 12 months aging in French oak, the power is all there in very dark, heavy tannins that dominate the fruit. This is a powerful expression of the richness and the structure of great Douro wines, all granite and mineral in character, dark and tough, sure to age well.",Auru,93,70.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Portal
136298,Portugal,"The joint venture between the Cazes family of Bordeaux and the Roquette family of Quinta do Crasto in the Douro is in its second released vintage. This is made using Bordeaux techniques, resulting in a style that is more structured than many Douro wines, exploiting ripe fruit with solid tannins, leavened by sweetness and sweet red fruits. The wood shows through on the finish.",Xisto,93,56.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Roquette e Cazes
136299,US,"The coolness of the site and the vintage has yielded a young, tart wine that fans of big, fat Chards might find lean and austere. But it's a grand wine for Burgundy lovers. Acidity is high, and there's a stony minerality undergirding the citrus, wildflower and smoky oak flavors. This is one of those rare Chards that needs some time to come around. Best 2008–2011.",La Cruz Vineyard,93,39.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Testarossa
136300,Spain,"Beautiful in color as it blends hues of purple and red. The nose is endowed with leather, herbs and cherry, while the full palate houses a delicious range of fruit and wood flavors along with fine tannins and length.

136301,US,"Like the winery's other 2005 Chardonnays, this one, tasted in March, is tightly wound and minerally. The aroma will show little if the wine is too cold. Flavor-wise, hints of tart tangerines, lemongrass, green apples, candied ginger and vanilla cream swirl into a smoky oak, spicy finish. This is a Chardonnay that needs some time in the bottle. Drink now and for a couple of years.",Dutton Ranch Dutton Palms Vineyard,93,42.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton Estate
136302,Chile,"Five years ago we said Domus Aurea could become one of Chile's very best Cabernets. But then focus, winemakers and other things changed and the quality slipped. But Domus seems to be back with a vengeance in 2003. A nosing yields a lot of earth, tobacco and leather, while the sly but sure flavor profile is centered on baked plum and cassis along with some herbal, terroir-ish shadings. Still not for everyone, but very, very interesting and not generic.",,92,50.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Domus Aurea
136303,France,"Toasty on the nose, accented by hints of peach, then turning honeyed and rich on the palate, with a slightly oily texture. Layers of velvety richness fill the mouth, with just enough acid to leave a lasting finish.",,92,90.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Marsanne,Domaine du Colombier
136304,US,"Fully mature now, although it still has a good six years left, this shows why certain Zins benefit from aging. Tight and tannicly dry to begin with, it has aged to something approaching Pinot-like delicacy, although the wild berry, roasted coffee and spice flavors are Zinny, and few Zinfandels will ever have these tannins.",Stellwagen Vineyard,92,25.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
136305,US,"Nearly five years after it was made, this Syrah remains dark and tannic, but the fruit is starting to make the magical transition from primary to secondary. It's picking up dried blackberry, dessicated blueberry and beef jerky flavors that finish long and spicy. Yet it still has youthful acidity and freshness. This will be a fun wine to follow over the next five years.",Trenton Estate Vineyard,92,25.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Joseph Swan Vineyards
136306,Spain,"Char and chocolate, then a dollop of rum raisin and black cherry, and there is your nose. This version of Cirsion, one of our very favorite modern Riojas, is relatively soft, raisiny and simple, and for that it doesn't quite rate with some of the past vintages, which were spectacular. But that doesn't mean you won't love the wine's smooth texture, cocoa and baked berry flavors, and its overall generous character. Drink now through 2010.",Cirsion,92,273.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Roda
136307,US,"This is a new wine from Longboard. The vineyard is on Westside Road, in the Middle Reach area that is prime Pinot country. But somehow, Merlot loves it. Softly lush and complex, with blackberry, blueberry, cherry, cola and spiced coffee flavors, finishing with new oaky vanillins. Really notable for its balance and harmony.",DaKine Vineyard,92,24.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Longboard
136308,Spain,"Right away this shows the requisite signs of excellence. The meaty, earthy, leathery, full-fruit nose is just right, and the palate is elevated in how it is infused with pure blackberry and plum as well as chocolate and fine herbs.

136309,Spain,"Like all young Sierra Cantabria wines made from old vines, this has a purple color that's supported by aromas of coffee, mocha and black fruits. It's half aged in American oak (the other half is French), and it's much more tannic, acidic and structured than the fleshy 2003. A wine with pure flavors and a dynamic structure. Just under 1,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Colección Privada,92,48.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
136310,Portugal,"A hugely juicy wine, dominated by Touriga Nacional, leavened by dry tannins. It's big, ripe, with vivid red fruits giving spice and power. Immediately attractive now, it is likely to age well over the next 5–8 years.",Grande Reserva,92,29.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Portal
136311,Portugal,"An impressively powerful wine, with concentrated fruit from old vines. It packs dense tannins, layers flavors of ripe figs, plums and raisins, along with wood flavors. The quinta is close to Regua in the western part of the Douro vineyards, a region particularly well suited to powerful but still elegant table wines.",Reserva,92,50.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Vallado
136312,US,"Charry, smoky oak stars in this young, well-structured wine, leading to powerhouse peach pie (with the crust), lemon mousse and buttered toast flavors that finish long and spicy.

136313,France,"Powerful and intense without going over the top, this is a fine example of white Hermitage. The golden straw color gives a first indication of its richness, followed by scents of honey, even a hint of butterscotch. It's unctuous in the mouth, boasting flavors of grilled nuts and stone fruits, and finishing with just a touch of warmth.",Marquise de la Tourette,92,50.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Rhône-style White Blend,Delas Frères
136314,Spain,"Benjamin Romeo makes nothing but big, idiosyncratic wines. And some are big hits while others may not be your thing. This modern, round, polished blend is creamy and smooth but also loaded with almond, pear, citrus and toast flavors. Certainly there's a strong wood element, but it handles it with aplomb and oozes class. Drink as soon as possible. It won't age much past 2007. Only 25 cases made.",Qué Bonito Cacareaba,92,74.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,White Blend,Benjamin Romeo
136315,US,"The name is a combination of eiswein and Scheurebe, the German variety. The grapes were artificially frozen. The wine is exceptionally sweet, with residual sugar of 21.5%, but balanced by crisp acidity, and the alcohol is amazingly low at 7.6%. Flavorwise, it's all about apricot preserves and vanilla. Hard to imagine anyone not liking this delicious dessert wine.",Eisrébe,92,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Scheurebe,Joseph Phelps
136316,France,"Wonderfully floral and spicy on the nose, with hints of anise that add nuance to the layers of raspberry fruit. Stéphane Ogier claims he adores the 2004 vintage, and with wines like this, why shouldn't he? This finishes lush and long, and although already approachable, should age effortlessly through at least 2015.",Lancement,92,180.0,Rhône Valley,Côte Rôtie,,Syrah,Michel & Stéphane Ogier
136317,US,"From estate-grown fruit, this is fragrant and off-dry, showing honeysuckle, Meyer lemon, tangerine and grapefruit in the mix of scents and flavors. It's a fine example of what Washington can do with Riesling, bringing bright, sappy fruit flavors to vibrant acidity, complex sugars and a lingering liveliness on the palate. If this is any indication of what this vineyard (and Chelan in general) is capable of producing, Washington has found its next great Riesling appellation.",Stone's Throw Vineyard,92,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Riesling,Nefarious Cellars
136318,Spain,"Robust and sexy, with smoke, leather and pure berry and plum aromas that make for a sensational bouquet. The palate is up to the precedent set by the nose, as the cherry and cola flavors are outright lovely. For what you get, this is almost a value. It shows us what that Muga can do in a great vintage.",Selección Especial Reserva,92,37.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Muga
136319,Spain,"Stylish and serious, with polished, fancy oak sitting like royalty atop dark   fruit that is almost pruney.

136321,US,"In keeping with their other estate wines, this pure, 100% varietal Cabernet from the Smasne Vineyard offers unblended and crisply defined varietal character. It's got plenty of cassis and cranberry fruit, compact and dense, and it tastes quite young still. The tannins are ripe and well-managed, but this is a wine that needs decanting or time in the bottle to fill out and show what's really in there.",Estate,90,42.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Smasne Cellars
136322,US,"This wine has been variable, but the '03 shows lots of varietal distinction.

136325,US,"Here is yet another Washington Riesling that shows how good these wines can be. This is well beyond the sweet and fruity style of the tasting room wines; here are layers of stone fruits, density and weight, length and detail.

136326,France,"This is part of a range which returns to origins, with wood fermentation for the wines.

136327,US,"Concentrated, beautifully defined flavors of pear, apple and ripe pineapple drive a stake through the heart of this wine, blazing a trail across the palate with tongue-thrashing acids and bracing minerality.

136328,France,"Still very young, this wine needs time to develop its intense minerality. Now it is more about grapefruit and yeast, although it is also full-bodied, a sign of the 1999 vintage. Wait five years at least.",Blanc de Blancs Brut,90,106.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Pol Roger
136329,US,"Shows the softness of Alexander Valley Chardonnay, and the delicious complexity that these wines can attain.

136330,Italy,"As with many of the wines of Sandrone, it is easy to be beguiled by the fruit, and miss the underlying structure holding it together. This is true of the Dolcetto, where the wine initially shows plenty of dark fruit and a touch of mint, but gains a spicy complexity as it takes in air. The wine will benefit from a couple of years in the bottle, but is delicious now.",,90,22.0,Piedmont,Dolcetto d'Alba,,Dolcetto,Sandrone
136331,US,"Despite the extra bottle age, it's a very youthful, dense wine. The Malbec is battened down with spicy purple fruit flavors and compact tannins. The balance is acid-driven, and the presence of new oak is muted. Will the tannins soften before the fruit fades? It's worth socking a bottle or two away to find out.",Bunk House,90,50.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Smasne Cellars

136333,New Zealand,"The Awatere is a subregion of Marlborough receiving more and more notice for its distinctive Sauvignons and Pinots.

136335,US,"Mostly Pinot Noir with some Chardonnay, this bubbly shows the pedigree of these two noble varieties in its balance and elegance.

136336,US,"This wine is formulaic in a good way; L'Ecole “owns” Sémillon in Washington, and it is hard to think of any winery in the country that does a better job with the grape.

136338,France,"Are delicate and full-bodied contradictions? Not here, with this ripe, red-fruit-flavored wine, which still creeps delicately around the palate.

136341,US,"Amicus has been doing a good job over the years producing richly intense mountain-style Cabs. This one, from a warm vintage, is very ripe, showing lusty red and black currant flavors.

136346,US,"This debut blend somehow reaches 15% alcohol, not easy to do with Yakima Valley Sangiovese. It's a solid effort, which opens well—supple and polished, with pretty flavors of mixed plum and berry. It's silky, smooth and there's plenty of tangy fruit. The finish gets a little too hot, but that's a minor quibble in a wine that gives you this much flavor at this price. The finish keeps getting more and more interesting, piling on smoked ham and spicy clove as it goes.",,90,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Hestia

136349,Italy,"Began with unpleasant swampy aromas, but they blew off, revealing dark fruit, spices and an earthiness that had nothing to do with the initial smells.

Simple but appealing. Pair with fresh fruit, desserts.",Áts Cuvée,87,20.0,Hungary,,,White Blend,Royal Tokaji
136365,US,"Grown well inland, in a hot, arid part of the county, this Zin got superripe in the '07 vintage.

136366,Spain,"Interesting blanco from the inland Galician region of Ribeira Sacra. It's Albariño with 15% Godello, and it's ready to drink now.

136368,US,"From a vineyard that has a long track record of success with Chardonnay, this new entry is a bit sharp and toasty, perhaps just a bit young to be at its peak. The fruit flavors are light and bring green apple and melon into play; the oak tastes new and not yet well-integrated, but with time this should balance out.",Nuclear Blonde Conner Lee Vineyard,87,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Barrage Cellars
136369,Argentina,"Chunky and full, with raisin, oak and mocha aromas. The palate comes across round and healthy, with mint and herb notes accenting plum and blackberry flavors.

136378,Australia,"This a pretty good effort for the price, offering authentic Pinot Noir scents of ripe cherries, marked by hints of bacon and briar.

136399,New Zealand,"A bit more understated than this wine has been in past vintages, but still of excellent quality, with lovely toasted-oat notes framing pear, melon and citrus flavors.

136407,Germany,"This bursts out of the chute in a blaze of fruit—pineapple, pear, green apple, even a trace of banana. Honestly, it's a bit disconcerting.

136409,US,"Not known as much for Merlot as for Cabernet, Sequoia Grove's bottling is rich, ripe and delicious, quite sumptuous in cherry, plum, cassis and mocha fruit flavors that finish dry.

136451,US,"This is a light, leafy wine, with tannins that taste of green tea and leave a sensation of astringency long after the wine is swallowed. Sounds like Burgundy!

136452,Italy,"Aromas of mature fruit, blackberry, leather, cigar, molasses and stewy herbal greens.

136456,Spain,"This tiny production SB is sweet and easygoing, with canned peach aromas along with pineapple and mild citrus flavors.

136543,US,"The winery calls this a “trocken” style. It's aromatic with a mouthwatering juiciness (though not too puckery) that invites a second (and third) glass.

136544,South Africa,"From the cool-climate region of Elgon, the Cluver Pinot offers sweet berries and violet on the nose and an unfolding palate of red berry, coffee and chocolate.

136545,Italy,"Spanish cedar, cola and bright cherry notes open the nose of this beautiful Rosso di Montalcino.

136547,Italy,"Vintner Gianni Pignattai has crafted a gorgeous Rosso di Montalcino that is a small step away in intensity and complexity from its big brother Brunello.

136548,US,"Shows tart cranberry crispness in addition to richer cherry and raspberry fruit, but it's a fairly aloof wine now, with competing parts.

136551,Italy,Valiano's beautifully aged Chardonnay delivers impressive complexity and depth of bouquet. What stands out here are the linear mineral tones that are framed by stone and passion fruits.

136553,Spain,"Dark and dense, with aromas of rich black fruits, grilled meat and a lot of oak. The palate is extracted but it's not the least bit hard or biting.

136568,US,"A good, complex wine, but the oak currently sticks out, swamping the fruit with caramel.

136583,Spain,"Jumps out of the chute with baked, earthy, funky aromas that are more savory and spicy than outright fruity.

136585,US,"Westland is the second label of Methven Family Vineyards. This seems sure to be a popular wine—broadly fruity, lightly chocolaty, firmly tannic, yet clearly varietal.

136587,Spain,"Comes across a bit baked, syrupy and sweet on the nose, with a hint of stalkiness and stem. The palate has a lush early feel, but further inspection unveils a hollow core.

136589,France,"Opens with an attractive musk note, followed by guava, quince and pear. The palate shows moderate intensity and good freshness. Winds up with a graham cracker note on the finish.

136590,US,"Right now my preference between Mondavi's Reserve and regular Chard is the regular. This is a better wine, from a classic Chablisian point of view, but it needs time.

136591,Chile,"A world-class wine from Chile? It has been for almost a decade, but now that it's pushing $100 we are looking at it quite critically.

Finishes layered and deep, with chocolate and mocha.",Alpha M,92,93.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Montes
136592,France,"From miniscule yields and the product of an outrageously hot, dry summer, this wine still shows some spice, but also jammier cherry and raspberry notes.

136593,France,"While Vacheron is famed for its reds, the whites are of an equal, if not greater, class. This big, dense, rounded wine is from one of the sunniest vineyards in Sancerre, and that shows in its power and richness.

136594,France,"A cherry-picked blend of six estate parcels, the 2003 Château d'Ampuis fills the gap in the Guigal hierarchy between the largely négoce Brune et Blonde and the single-vineyard bottlings.

136597,US,"Tolosa has been making seriously good Syrah for some years now. The quality shows not just in the ripeness, but in the acidity that gives the wine brightness and balance. This was a warm vintage, even in cool Edna Valley, and the wine shows extraordinarily powerful blackberry-pie filling, cherry compote and chocolate flavors, but that high acidity really makes the fruit sing.",1772 Edna Ranch,92,46.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Tolosa
136598,US,"A nice, rich Cab that shows off its Napa pedigree.

136604,US,"This is a really good Pinot, dry and rich, and it shows the balance of power and racy delicacy that Green Valley Pinots, and particularly Iron Horse's, are known for.

The '05 is their best yet, a dry, silky, light-bodied wine, with complex layers of cherry skin, rhubarb pie, root beer, rose petal and red licorice flavors, enhanced with toasted new oak. The winemaker seems to be striving to tame the aggressive character this vineyard can bring to Pinot, in favor of delicacy and elegance. He has largely succeeded. A wine to watch.",Garys' Vineyard,92,50.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Surh Luchtel
136606,US,"Doesn't say “dry” on the label, like so many others do, but it really is basically dry, which allows the palate to savor the pure fruit of the grape and the beautifully crisp acids.

The '05 shows the vineyard's typicity in the big, ripe fruit and fullness of mouthfeel, yet stays elegant and polished.

136612,US,"A best barrels blend of the winery's various vineyards, which are numerous throughout California, Niclaire shows a balance and elegance that prove Pinot doesn't have to come from a single vineyard to be great.

136616,Spain,"It has taken this bodega a few years to get it right, but in 2004 this blend of 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet is dark and rocking. The nose offers that modern but increasingly familiar blast of bacon, baked fruit pastry and leather, and the palate works its magic with black plum and smoked game flavors.

136618,France,"Rather nutty—almonds—on the nose, then broadening out on the palate into apricots and oranges.

136620,US,"A fine follow-up to Seia's inaugural 2004 Clifton Hill, this again delivers ripe, concentrated flavors of plum and berry, lifted with citrus and finishing with a hint of mint. Despite the high (15.3%) alcohol, it is clean and bracing, with natural acids and very little heat in the finish. As young as it is, it hits a bit of a dead spot in the back, but it has the stuffing (and the pedigree) that would suggest that with a few years of cellaring it will open out and show more of the herb and smoked meat character that is lurking just below the surface.",Clifton Hill Vineyard,90,30.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Seia

136707,South Africa,"Don't let the screwcap fool you: this wine has quality written all over it. Twelve months in mostly American oak yields graham cracker and lemon aromas, with young blackberry and herbs supporting. Oak again shows in the mouth, supporting dark fruit flavors.

136710,Uruguay,"This wine captures the enigma that is Uruguayan Tannat. The nose is ripe, the color bold and purple. From that, you'd expect a lot.

136730,Uruguay,"Approachable on the nose, but like so many other Tannats it's like nails on the palate. And here the fruit is snappy and tangy, not dark and sweet. You could call it juicy or just as easily call it sour.",,81,18.0,Atlantida,,,Tannat,Viñedo de los Vientos

It should age well.",Clavoillon Premier Cru,95,113.0,Burgundy,Puligny-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Domaine Leflaive
136801,France,"Mineral and structured, this is a wine that is very linear and almost austere. There is elegance, fruit and wood along with a hint of ripe plums and peaches. But always that minerality, that steely character, which promise long aging.",,95,253.0,Burgundy,Chevalier-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Etienne Sauzet
136802,France,"This is the one grand cru that is entirely in Chassagne-Montrachet. It's a tiny patch of land (4.13 acres) making wines that are more delicate than the others. With its fine, fresh flavors so light to the taste, this is a wine that floats on the palate with a smooth, silky texture. Wood and white peaches contribute but do not dominate.",,95,250.0,Burgundy,Criots-Bâtard-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Louis Latour
136803,France,"The most well known of Puligny's premier cru vineyards, Les Combettes is at the very heart of the slope. This central position shows in this dense and concentrated wine that's big, powerful and marked by fresh fruit-salad flavors of green figs, green apple and spice. The whole is borne up by a fine, solid structure of wood and tannins.",Les Combettes Premier Cru,94,119.0,Burgundy,Puligny-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Etienne Sauzet
136804,France,"This is the smallest of the grand crus of Puligny-Montrachet, a mere 8.6 acres. This wine shows the vineyard's typical elegance, with delicious flavors of pears,  almonds and vanilla, hovering on the palate for minutes, leaving a dancing freshness.",,94,250.0,Burgundy,Bienvenues Bâtard-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Louis Latour
136805,France,"The pinnacle of the white wines from Roux Père et Fils, this is  properly opulent, gorgeously rich, spicy and full of quince and lychee flavors, along with a discrete layer of new wood. Its complexity pays due respect to the quality of the vineyard. Keep for many years.",,94,109.0,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne,,Chardonnay,Roux Père et Fils
136806,Austria,"Wenzel's top cuvée is frighteningly expensive, but there's no denying the quality. Intensely botrytized aromas of dried apricots billow from the glass, accented by hints of toast, vanilla and coconut from aging in new oak barrels. Round and mouthfilling, it is very sweet, but with just enough acid to provide a semblance of balance. Dried apricot flavors dominate, but there's also superripe apple and melon flavors, while hints of spice and citrus emerge on the long finish. A worthy successor to the 2001.",Saz Ruster Ausbruch,94,120.0,Burgenland,,,White Blend,Wenzel
136807,US,"Maresh (pronounced ‘marsh') is one of the half dozen oldest Pinot vineyards in Oregon, with some blocks dating to 1970. This wine shows a very feminine side of the grape, floral and elegant, with a soft and lovely nose that floats raspberry, cream and light perfume scents up from the glass. It concentrates its flavors on the back palate, where things linger nicely with resonant berry and spice.",Maresh Vineyard,94,49.0,Oregon,Oregon,Oregon Other,Pinot Noir,Rex Hill
136808,France,"Rich and ample, this is an impressive wine. The fruit and wood flavors work together to give a feeling of seriousness and great ageability. With its spice, toast notes and dark-hued structure, this will age well over the next five to 10 years.",,94,280.0,Burgundy,Bâtard-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Louis Latour
136809,France,"Relatively closed up at this stage, not giving much, this wine is all about freshness, poised but rich fruit and a structure that suggests long-term development. The wood is quite prominent, overshadowing what will be delicious yellow-fruit flavors. Come back to this wine in five years—it will be magnificent.",Genevrières Premier Cru,94,102.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Morey-Blanc
136810,US,"Terrific Syrah. It has plenty of blackberry, cherry and cocoa flavors, and lots of smoky new oak. Richly sweet in tannins, with good acidity. But that's just the beginning. The wine, from Carneros, also has enormously complex nuances that teasingly reveal themselves sip by sip.",,94,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,John Anthony
136811,US,"Another great RSR. A bit soft, but that's okay, as the pineapple custard, white peach and vanilla-oak flavors are perked up by bright citron and Meyer lemon. The finish is pure honey, rich and long and spicy. Such a complex wine.",Red Shoulder Ranch,94,43.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Shafer
136812,US,"Loie's Block is the oldest in the Maresh vineyard, and shows the elegance and grace of old vines. The wine is sculpted and feminine, but not bashful. Its sweet cherry core is wrapped in piney tannins—the herbs jut out, as often happens in young Oregon Pinot Noir. The angularity and definition suggest that a bit of time will turn this into a multi-dimensional, Burgundian wine.",Maresh Vineyard Loie's Block,94,75.0,Oregon,Oregon,Oregon Other,Pinot Noir,Rex Hill
136813,US,"What an aroma. So Côte-Rôtie, so powerful and rich, yet so refined. Masses of white pepper, cassis, freshly ground French roast, cocoa, gingersnap cookie, char, vanilla, cinnamon—and that's just the smell! In the mouth, there's all that and more. Dry, massive, deep and long. A triumph. 2008–2020.",Hayne Vineyard,94,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Petite Sirah,Turley
136814,US,"What a complex and interesting blend of Roussanne and Viognier. Opens with a honeyed, marzipan and almond cookie bouquet, but turns surprisingly dry and acidically crisp in the mouth, with Meyer lemon, vanilla, gingerbread and Asian spice flavors. Really impressive for its power, depth and length.",Contrarian,94,36.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Rhône-style White Blend,Linne Calodo
136815,France,"Bâtard-Montrachet is the largest of the white grand crus, yielding archetypal fat, open, generous white Burgundies. Louis Jadot's wine does not disappoint.

136817,France,"A big boy with almost fleshy fruit. The flavors push into exotic, tropical richness yet retain spicy citrus-rind highlights. There is nothing clumsy, despite the ripeness; the finish seems to extend almost infinitely and keeps zinging you with surprises—marshmallow, marzipan, cookie dough, etc. An added bonus: the back label clearly indicates when it was bottled and cellared (2001).",Réserve Brut,94,36.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Charles Heidsieck
136818,France,"While the wood aromas dominate, on the palate, there is a much richer, rounder character. This wine, with its huge fruit, white peach flavors, layers of wood and citrus, is just waiting to burst out of its youth. Delicious ripeness and acidity lend balance, while the oak needs some time to calm down and mature.",,94,198.0,Burgundy,Bienvenues Bâtard-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Domaine Vincent Girardin
136819,France,"An intense, complex wine that flows unctuously with rich white fruits, spice, vanilla, some toast and a great depth of flavor. At this stage, the toast is quite dominant, but the rich fruit is on its way up. Like many great white Burgundies, this wine needs to be opened well in advance of drinking.",Champ Gain Premier Cru,94,61.0,Burgundy,Puligny-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Louis Jadot
136820,Germany,"This estate has been turning out better and better wines nearly every year, and this may be its best yet. A fabulous bouquet of honeyed slate, green apples and limes is followed by flavors that are sweet yet balanced, with great freshness and racy acidity. Finishes long and mouthwatering. Not only about power, there's also elegance to spare.",Trittenheimer Apotheke Auslese,94,40.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Grans-Fassian
136821,France,"Like many wines from Lafon, this is initially deceptive. It bursts open in the mouth, like a fruit bomb. But watch for the structure as well, because this is a wine that will age. Keep for at least 5 years.",Les Perrières Premier Cru,94,156.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Domaine des Comtes Lafon
136822,France,"A structured wine that is going to need 4 or 5 years to really open up. Already there is power and intense green-fruit flavors, but at the moment new-wood flavors are dominant. Don't drink now.",Charmes Premier Cru,93,,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Domaine des Comtes Lafon
136823,France,"Blending grapes from two vineyards—Les Case-Têtes (broken heads, so called from the steepness of the slope) and Les Murgers de Monthelie—Patrick Javillier has created a big, bold, ripe wine that keeps a mineral, crisp center.

136825,US,"This is the palest and lightest of Calera's ‘02 Pinots, but paradoxically it's enormously concentrated in flavor and possible the most ageworthy. It explodes with cherry cola, cherry pie filling, raspberry, blueberry, cocoa-dusted latte and cinnamon-nutmeg spice. But it has the depth and balance for the long haul. Best now through 2012.",Selleck Vineyard,93,58.0,California,Mt. Harlan,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Calera
136826,US,"A gorgeous wine, soft as old kid leather, with impressively ripe blackberry pie, chocolate, anise and coffee flavors. Although it's high in alcohol, the wine isn't hot.

136827,Argentina,"While all of Trapiche's single-vineyard Malbecs are excellent, this is the rock star of the group. From 50-year-old vines, Coletto offers prune, fruitcake and cedary aromas in front of a jammy but structured palate. Smooth as silk with hints of Port.

136833,US,"It's hard to find good Washington Malbec under $20. Start here. Stone Tree (Wahluke Slope) vineyard provided much of the fruit, and there is a small (10%) amount of new oak in the mix.

136834,Portugal,"A fresh, cream and baked apple wine, with some good citrus zest, acidity and a taut texture. It has a pure, crisp character which then moves into a firm, pear juice flavor. Another year would soften and release the spicy wood.",Guru,90,,Douro,,,Portuguese White,Wine & Soul
136835,Spain,"The label says it: fermented in barrel. And one sniff delivers the buttery, toasted character of a Burgundy or California Chardonnay.

136836,US,"Winemaker Lloyd Anderson is consistent and stylish in his winemaking, and his wines show well across the board.

136837,France,"This is big Fleurie, dominated by floral aromas and dry tannins at this stage, and therefore likely to develop for a year or two. The fruits are dark plum, full in the mouth. The acidity offers freshness but also adds to the weight of the texture.",Château des Moriers,90,17.0,Beaujolais,Fleurie,,Gamay,Signé Vigneron
136838,US,"This is a hugely flavored, extracted Pinot Noir, distinctly Californian in its ripeness and size. It's massive in cherries and raspberries, with hints of cocoa, anise, Indian spices and black pepper. With 60% new French oak, it's also pretty toasty.

136839,US,"Plump and spicy, mixing mint and apple, with flavors running into riper fruits—pear and peach.

136841,US,"We need wines like this that are super-dry, ultra-crisp in acidity and sleakly lean. This one's the anti-Chardonnay.

Crab salad in lettuce wraps or chicken satay skewers come to mind.",,90,16.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Joseph Carr
136842,US,"This big, powerful Pinot Noir needs some time to resolve its contradictions. It's totally dry, with silky tannins and fine coastal acidity, but there's a heavy density to the cherry, orange zest, spice and sandalwood flavors.

The finish is elegant and refined.",,90,20.0,Tuscany,Rosso di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Cordella
136847,US,"This is pure Cabernet from the estate vineyard. These are still young vines, and though the potential for greatness is there, they don't deliver the complexity of their neighbor Ciel du Cheval—yet.

136852,Spain,"The opening of peach, mineral, honey and wild green herbs is alluring, and the palate runs smooth and full, and also a little soft and mature.

136857,US,"A broad streak of vanilla is set against beautifully ripe, tart and polished raspberry and black cherry fruit.

136880,Italy,There is a particularly attractive mineral vein here that appears prominently on the nose. This sparkling wine gains heft and structure in the mouth thanks to the plump fruit and fragrant floral tones to follow.,Brut,87,12.0,Veneto,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,,Glera,Le Manzane
136881,Italy,"Masottina offers widely available Proseccos with an easy, informal approach and a good eye to quality. This Extra Dry expression is not too intense but it does offer cheerful, light tones of white flowers and stone fruit.",Extra Dry,87,24.0,Veneto,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,,Glera,Masottina
136882,Spain,"Round and generally attractive, with raisiny richness that emerges with airing. The palate is more snappy and acidic than the nose might suggest, with herbal raspberry flavors. That same acidity lifts the finish, and overall the wine is fresh, racy and not that complex.",Reserva,87,25.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
136883,Australia,"Lean and tightly-wound with aromas of green beans, kiwi and grapefruit, followed by flavors of white flowers, cumin and lemon. Finishes clean and green. Try with shrimp. Drink now.",,87,13.0,Victoria,Victoria,,Sauvignon Blanc,Taltarni
136884,US,"Juicy in tutti-frutti blackberries, cherries, plums, raspberries and milk chocolate, this soft, smooth Zin is also very peppery. It's a somewhat rustic wine to wash down with barbecue.",Cacophony,87,14.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Toad Hollow
136885,Italy,"Here's a vintage Extra Dry Prosecco with a tonic, firm feel in the mouth and pretty aromas of honeysuckle, jasmine, lemon blossom and peach. The bubbling is foamy and smooth and there's just the right level of acidity on the close.",Millesimato Extra Dry,87,19.0,Veneto,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,,Glera,Val d'Oca
136886,US,"Tight and crisp in acidity, with a tart, citrus fruit bite, like grapefruit. But the raspberry and cherry pie filling flavors are very rich, and the finish is dry. So will it mellow with age? Probably not. Drink now.",,87,36.0,California,Marin County,North Coast,Pinot Noir,Vergari
136887,New Zealand,"A very good Pinot Noir at a realistic price, Villa Maria's 2008 Private Bin offers solid cherry fruit and touches of barrel char and beet root. The texture is silky, the finish reasonably long. Drink it over the next year or so.",Private Bin,87,20.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Villa Maria
136888,Germany,"Savory in aroma, with popcorn and toast flavors punctuated by a spice thread. Noticeably off-dry, this subtle white winds up on a sweet peach note. Drink now.",Niersteiner Hipping Spätlese,87,19.0,Rheinhessen,,,Riesling,Weingut Georg Albrecht Schneider
136889,Spain,"From Viña Mayor, this French-oak-aged wine is composed and dry, with good plum and berry aromas that bring balanced oak as well. The palate sports proper weight and balance, solid berry and plum flavors, and a warm, minty finish. Not mind blowing but good for a weak vintage.",Secreto,87,20.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
136890,Spain,"With its spice and fig aromas, this registers as a rich, mature Rioja reserva. The palate runs toward sweet plums and blackberry, while the finish is mildly toasty and full, with coffee as the lasting flavor. This has many good qualities, not the least of which is balance and a touch of citrus peel. Best now–2010. 525 cases produced.",Cata de Consejero,91,58.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Consejo de la Alta
136891,Spain,"A sweet, ripe, jammy style for Roda I, with smooth tannins, corpulence and more than adequate minerality and power. This is not a flabby wine despite the heat of the vintage, and the lush cassis, blackberry and mocha notes come together on the back palate and finish.",Roda I,91,73.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Roda
136892,Spain,"Thick, brooding and aromatically mature, this delivers heft, grab and balance. It has developed black-fruit flavors followed by a cushioned, soft finish. Drink now and over the next several years as the 2001 gets better and the promising but not yet released 2004 begins to settle. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Reserva,91,77.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Remírez de Ganuza
136893,Italy,"There's a subtle elegance to this wine that really sets it apart from the rest. The aromas are defined and fresh, bringing in mixed herbs, stone fruit and crisp minerality. It's very soft and feathery light in the mouth with layers of fruity nuances: After a period on the lees, it ages six months in Slavonian oak casks.",Haberlehof,91,22.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Pinot Bianco,Alois Lageder
136894,US,"Rich and dry, with a wealth of blackberry and cherry tart flavors, straight from the oven with the smoky-sweet, cinnamon and burnt butter tang of the crust. You'll notice the tannins, which lend a stimulating structure. This isn't one of those blockbuster cult Merlots, just a red wine of impeccable proportions that yearns to wash down elegant fare.",,91,32.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Merlot,Cuvaison
136895,France,"Delas's big bottling of Hermitage blends three sites, including Les Bessards and L'Hermite to make a Hermitage that should be relatively easy to find at close to 2,000 cases produced. The 2005 is a muscular wine with dusty tannins that demands cellaring, even though it does show attractive notes of cassis and a distinctive blood-iron-mineral streak. Try after 2015.",Marquise de la Tourette,91,67.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,Delas Frères
136896,New Zealand,"Broad and sweet, but the sugars are amply balanced by this wine's dusty minerality and dried-spice character. Honey, spice and apple shadings on the nose glide easily into flavors of baked apple on the palate, while the finish possesses a tactile minerality that precisely brings all of the components into harmony. Drink now–2016.",,91,27.0,Central Otago,,,Riesling,Felton Road
136897,Spain,"You're going to like this masculine, well-oaked blend of 80% Tempranillo with 10% each Graciano and Garnacha. It's got modern touches but a lot of tradition as well. The wine is rich and round, with tobacco, coffee, chocolate and earth creating depth and character. With fine mouthfeel and a solid finish, you can drink now or hold a few more years.",Coto Real Reserva,91,46.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,El Coto
136898,US,"Like the Rutherford bottling, this is a strictly limited-production item, with only 125 cases produced.

Drink now–2015.",,91,100.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Etude
136899,US,"This moderately off-dry (1% residual sugar) Columbia Valley Riesling explodes from the glass with big, round aromas suggestive of ripe melon, tropical fruits and citrus. The balance is perfect, with plenty of natural acidity. The winemaker notes, with unusual aplomb, that “With bottle aging the fermentation aromatics of Bazooka bubblegum will develop into classic, and very subtle petroleum aromas.” Who's going to argue with that?",,91,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Riesling,J. Bookwalter
136900,US,"There's a savage quality to this Syrah, suggesting fresh wild berries growing in fields of lavender, rosemary and pepper tree, and something animal, like roasted meat bone. Under all that it erupts with intense cherry and blackberry fruit, and the sizable tannins make for a puckery feeling. This is quite an interesting Syrah that will gain in complexity over the next five years.",Benediction,91,32.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Manzanita Creek
136901,Spain,"This seems eminently ageworthy; it has the strong foundation and pulsing acidity required of a true cellar dweller. The raspberry and plum fruit have a beam of acidity and the tannins are not shy. Shows all the hallmarks of a fine modern Rioja: power, purity and balance. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Torre Muga,91,90.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Muga
136902,US,"The grapes barely got ripe in this vineyard in chilly Marin, just north of the Golden Gate. The numbers tell the story. Acidity is .082 grams, alcohol is 11.8%, there's no oak, and the wine was stirred on the lees for five months. The result is an impressive Riesling, one of the driest on the market, a wine of great delicacy and subtlety. Fruit isn't the star here; minerals are. This is a wine to watch.",The Shell Mound,91,22.0,California,Marin County,North Coast,Riesling,Pey-Marin
136903,Portugal,"The name refers to the big meander the Douro river takes around the quinta's vineyards, forming a long peninsula. Like its big brother, the quinta wine, this reflects the heat and the concentrated fruit that comes from this famed vineyard. Its tannins are almost impenetrable at this stage, deep and dry, needing several years of aging to reveal the solid, ripe dark, spicy flavors.",Meandro do Vale Meão,91,49.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Vale Meão
136904,Portugal,"The darkest, most impressive version of the Duas Quintas brand, this Reserva is made in the open lagars, from foot-trodden grapes in the tradition still used by major Port houses. It gives a ripe, sweet, almost Port-like character, but still firmed by structure and dusty tannins to go with the superripe plums.",Duas Quintas Reserva Especial,91,54.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Ramos-Pinto
136905,New Zealand,"With its relatively modest alcohol (10.5%) and lovely sugar-acid balance, this Riesling could pass for an excellent spätlese. Aromas are floral and fruit-filled, yielding hints of apple, pineapple and even a suggestion of red berries, while the flavors echo with apples, stone fruit and strawberries. Clean and fresh on the finish. This is delicious now, but should hold at least 5–6 years, maybe longer.",Waldron Vineyard,91,35.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Villa Maria
136906,Chile,"Attractive mint and spice aromas play with herbal black fruit on the firm bouquet, and after that there's plenty of blackberry and plum to propel the palate. As always, this is a premier Chilean red blend that grafts pure power to elegance. It may not have the potency and density of fruit of the 2003, but it isn't lacking.",Clos Apalta,91,70.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Red Blend,Lapostolle
136907,Spain,"A dense wine from the start, and each subsequent whiff of the oaky but vital nose is convincing. The palate here is exemplary, especially for an '02; there's dark berry and plum flavors backed by notes of black licorice and pepper. An exceedingly nice wine with a textbook mix of tannins, flesh and acidity.",Reserva,91,28.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Ostatu
136908,France,"From old vines on chalky soil, this wine minerality as well as concentration. It is crisp but full, ripe but fresh. There's a touch of spiciness to complement the ripe green plum and apple skin flavors.",Les Caillottes,91,30.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Pascal Jolivet
136909,US,"A big, rich, almost chocolaty Pinot, with some of those darker flavors offset by brighter cherry notes.

Drink now–2012.",Heirloom,91,80.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Etude
136910,France,"From clay and chalk soil, Boisfleury is the finest of Alain Cailbourdin's three cuvées. This 2006 gives ripeness and freshness, but also a firm structure and weight behind the mineral front. This should age well—over 5 years.",Cuvée de Boisfleury,91,,Loire Valley,Pouilly-Fumé,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine A. Cailbourdin
136911,France,"Bottled only a few months prior to this tasting, the wine was still rather closed aromatically, but wonderfully ripe and supple on the palate.

136912,US,"A lovely wine, soft, supple and complex. It shows ripe, forward flavors of blackberries, cassis, mushu plum sauce, chocolate and oaky smoke and vanilla, with a sweet, wild edge of lavender and violets.

136913,US,"Enormously ripe berries characterize this wine; it explodes with wild raspberries, cherries, blackberries and dark chocolate, with a peppery, minty finish. But it's young and vigorous in rich, dense tannins, suggesting ageability. Best now, with decanting, and for several years.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,91,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
136914,US,"Like a breath of springtime in the California hills. Hints of new green grass, acacia blossom, clover honey and buttercup lead to notes of cassis in this bone-dry, crisply acidic wine, which shows how beautifully Lake County deals with Sauvignon Blanc.",,91,15.0,California,High Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Sauvignon Blanc,Two Angels

136916,France,"A selection of Voge's oldest vines from an especially granitic southeastern exposure, this is more of everything than the Vieilles Vignes bottling—more intense, smoky, dense and dark. The mouthfeel is rich and nearly syrupy, while the flavors burst with cherries and spice that linger on the finish.",Les Vieilles Fontaines,91,100.0,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Syrah,Alain Voge
136917,Italy,"This is impressive on many fronts, not least of which is the fact that it is one of the first wines in Italy to boast a glass cork. The glass works wonders helping to preserve a wine with intense and pristine floral, nutty—especially almonds—and mineral aromas.",Norital,91,,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Pinot Nero,Loacker
136918,Chile,"It doesn't take an expert to quickly realize that this is a fine Cabernet. The nose deals potent black cherry and char, while airing unleashes a subtle perfume and floral notes. In the mouth, there's ripe berry flavors and chocolate, while late in the game the tannins stay smooth but tight. A congruent wine with no flaws. Ready now or ageable for a couple of years.",Cuvée Alexandre Apalta Vineyard,91,23.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lapostolle
136919,US,"Tastes like one of those long hangtime wines where the grapes got superripe. The result is enormous flavors, stupendous really, of melted chocolate, raspberry and cherry purée, gingerbread, chocolate chip cookie, crème de cassis, licorice; the list goes on and on. Yet the wine is fundamentally dry, with balancing acids and tannins. Drink now.",Masked Man Vineyard,91,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,Calix

136922,US,"Light and touched with white pepper and fresh herb, this juicy young Barbera actually tastes like the grape; it's not just generic. Flavors combine strawberry, sour cherry and tobacco leaf; there's a residual flavor of licorice in the finish.",,87,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Barbera,Ryan Patrick
136923,Italy,"This is a lovely Sauvignon with very characteristic aromas of cut basil, capers, tomato leaf and delicate petroleum notes. The most noticeable thing is the wine's aromatic intensity that comes off in steady bursts but does so in a way that is enticing and seductive. The wine's structure is compact, yet creamier than most.",,87,18.0,Northeastern Italy,Friuli,,Sauvignon,Plozner
136924,Italy,"Petrussa delivers a great drinking experience thanks to the lively aromatics and natural freshness of its crisp Sauvignon.

136925,Portugal,"Ripe, soft and fruity, with dense sweet fruit. The wine is approachable, an enticing mix of tannins, spice and coffee. With its fruity finish, the wine is sure to please.

136927,Argentina,"Dark in color, with creamy aromas that hint at prune and chocolate. And while the wine is certainly soft and saturated, it isn't overly flabby. Still, it's ultraripe tasting, with rich blackberry and fudge flavors. Nocturnal in style, which is perfect for the jaguar (Yaguareté).",Yaguareté Collection,87,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Chakana
136928,France,"There's no escaping the garrigue in this wine—lavender, thyme, and rosemary all dominate the nose with accents of strawberry, red cherry and chalk.

Finishes with fresh-roasted coffee notes and a wave of leftover acidity.",Reserva,87,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Colores del Sol
136930,France,"A blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache, this wine shows beautiful components of raspberry preserves, juicy red plum guts, rosemary, licorice and hints of violet. Vibrant and fruity with a lighter weight than its attributes might suggest and a clean, lingering finish.",Prestige Saint-Drézéry,87,20.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Coteaux du Languedoc,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Château Puech-Haut
136931,Italy,"Executed in a ramato style (in which the wine keeps longer contact with the skins to obtain a pink-copperish color), this is a well-balanced Pinot Grigio with pretty aromas of fruits and flowers and a smooth, creamy finish.",,87,16.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,Pinot Grigio,Cantarutti
136932,Portugal,"A firm, tightly coiled and structured wine, which tastes of the granite soil of the Dão.

136935,Argentina,"Airy floral notes and a whiff of strawberry on the nose give this wine a lighter outlook, yet the palate is still fairly full-bodied as it offers ripe blackberry and chocolate flavors.

136936,Australia,"The 2006 Custodian blends slightly disparate pieces into a harmonious whole.

136946,US,"Spicy almost to a fault, this Cab Franc, sourced from the excellent Boushey vineyard, is structured along varietal lines, with sharp, earthy tannins, strong coffee flavors, spice and herbs in place of sweet berry flavors.

136948,Italy,"There's added dimension here in the form of light smoke, banana and peach that frame this luminous Pinot Grigio.

136949,Argentina,"Rubbery and a bit herbal on the nose, with a smack of rhubarb-like sharpness offset by deeper, more common berry fruit aromas.

136950,US,"Consistent with the rather lean house style this opens with herbal aromas set against firm, varietal cassis and blue plum fruit. The grapes come from a block planted in 1985. Some barrel spice adds cinnamon to the nose, and there's a touch of Cab Franc (6%) in the blend, which stiffens up the tannins. Retasting this wine after it has spent a few extra months in bottle, it's smoothed out a bit, and the sweet black- cherry fruit has moved forward. This should age really well.",Estate,89,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gamache

136958,Italy,"A skillful blending of 50% Barbera and 50% Nebbiolo, the Cogno has lovely wild strawberry aromas, cranberry and a touch of licorice.

136960,France,"This must be one of the most familiar nonvintage Champagnes, so it's good to be able to report that it is much improved.

136962,New Zealand,"This iconic New Zealand winery's Sauvignon Blanc hits all the right notes in 2007, featuring lush stone-fruit flavors accented by less ripe notes of fresh herbs and capsicum.

136963,US,"Slightly sweet, with spearmint, fig, lime and vanilla oak flavors balanced with crisp acids, this Sauvignon Blanc comes from the winery's estate vineyard in the warmer eastern valley.

136964,US,"This 50-50 blend from two well-established vineyards is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Young and stiff and still quite tannic, it shows compact cassis and blackberry fruit with an earthy underpinning, a hint of stem that adds some bite to the tannins. As time smoothes it and softens the tannins, more of the concentrated fruit should emerge; it's well-made and balanced; a fine example of Washington Cabernet Sauvignon done in a classic Bordeaux style.",GV Reserve Gamache - Champoux Vineyard Select,89,40.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gamache
136965,US,"Soft and plush, this is a sweetly plummy, cherry pie-flavored Merlot that does for a meal what a pillow does for a bed.

136966,Australia,"Bold strawberry and cherry flavors come across as just a tiny bit sweet—and there is 8 g/L of residual sugar in this wine. But despite a slightly confected quality, this effusive, berry-flavored blend of Grenache, Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Pinot Meunier finishes clean and refreshing. Not meant for aging; drink until the next vintage becomes available.",Rosé of Virginia,89,23.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Rosé,Charles Melton
136967,US,"Made from traditional Port varieties, this 11 year-old wine has achieved a soft, nutty silkiness, although it still contains fine, crisp acids and smooth tannins. It's not terribly sweet, with flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants, chocolate truffle and caramel. Needs more concentration.",Single Harvest Colheita Reserve,89,90.0,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Sierra Foothills,Port,Renwood
136968,Australia,"This broad, mouthfilling Grenache rosé features hints of berries, chocolate and some herbaceous notes.

136969,France,"This is full, perhaps heavy, but certainly with a fine, powerful character. The acidity and the green-apple texture are at one with the white-fruit flavors, which gives extra richness to the wine. Just a hint of mineral can be detected.",Fleur de Champagne Blanc de Blancs Brut,89,400.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Perrier Jouët
136970,France,"Toasty, floral and full-bodied, with a soft aftertaste, this has a great aromatic swathe initially, with only hints of Chardonnay minerality.

136974,US,"Ten acres of Malbec was planted at Gamache in 2003; this is the first vintage to be released. It's off to a promising start, although the fruit thins out quickly. There are nicely managed tannins, earthy and herbal, tasting of green tea and displaying lovely aromatics. Scents of rose petals mingle with black tea, and in the mouth it is balanced and complex, with sweet blueberry and candy apple fruit, lightly dusted with cinnamon spice.",Estate,88,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Malbec,Gamache

136977,Austria,"The rock soils of the Kollmütz vineyard give a very lean, mineral, almost austere character to this wine, in its early development.

136978,Italy,"The Il Cielo offers a complex nose of marzipan, licorice and dark fruit. On the palate, the fruit shows more of a plumminess and the licorice and marzipan notes are less pronounced. A solid medium finish. Overall, this is a well made, balanced pleasant wine with plenty of character.",Il Cielo,88,20.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,La Sera
136979,Argentina,"A hulk of a wine with forced oak that results in aromas of mint, char, citrus peel and smoke. The palate is endowed with ample black cherry, raspberry and mocha flavors, while the finish mixes orange peel, chocolate and a lot of leftover wood resin.

136980,Germany,"Still in need of cellaring or decanting to rid itself of some sulfury scents, but underneath that are some strident lime and green apple notes struggling to emerge.

136981,Portugal,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Touriga Nacional, so called because producer Paulo Cunha and US importer Robert Kacher felt the Cabernet was new world in its contribution, while the Touriga was firmly in the old world.

136982,South Africa,"A collaboration between Rust en Vrede's Jean Engelbrecht and golf star Ernie Els, this blend shows off Shiraz's spicy, peppery nose and Bordeaux's classic dry, earthy feel.

137028,Austria,"What a beautiful wine, with honey, perfumes, acidity and delicate fruit. It is certainly ripe, with tropical fruits and a pure citric streak.

137030,US,"100% estate grown. More tannic and dense than the Cabernet, this is roughly three-quarters Cabernet, one-sixth Merlot, but replaces that wine's Cab Franc and Carmenère with Petit Verdot.

It has a rich minerality and flavors of lime and pineapple custard, and then an even richer crème brûlée finish. Delicious and complex.",Cresta Ridge Vineyard,92,38.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
137130,Spain,"A little more herbal, stalky and tomato-influenced than the riper, fresher 2005, but still an elegant, complex wine that shines a positive light on this little-known region at the base of the Pyrenees. Tobacco, tomato leaf, root beer and bouillon flavors set up an herbal, almost Bordeaux-like finish. Layered and structured to boot. Drink now through 2012.",Blecua,90,100.0,Northern Spain,Somontano,,Red Blend,Viñas del Vero
137131,South Africa,"Cinnamon, plum, blackberry and cedar aromas start this rich but poised red. Savory flavors of black fruit and spice are accompanied by fine, chalky tannins. Pair with lamb, richer fare.",Bonne Nouvelle,90,34.0,Stellenbosch,,,Red Blend,Remhoogte
137132,Portugal,"A big rich wine in taste, and well balanced with the alcohol, giving a smooth texture, with good density of black plum juice flavors. It is a solid, chunky structure, a potential powerhouse, looking for aging 5–6 years.",Passadouro,90,,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Passadouro
137133,US,"Previous vintage were called L'Etalon but a threatened legal action prompted the name change. It's the same type of Bordeaux blend. When first opened it's quite firm and tannic; as it breathes you'll note hints of violets and a core of cassis, all beautifully proportioned.",Le Coursier Red Wine,90,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Brian Carter Cellars
137134,US,"In this newest vintage of Oriana, the Riesling component has been bumped up to 18%; the rest is half Viognier, 31% Roussanne. The three grapes complement each other well; the Riesling adding aromatics, acidity and a barely perceptible amount of residual sugar. This opens with a vitamin pill aroma that slowly dissipates; the fruit flavors are a mix of pineapple and Satsuma orange, with lots of natural acidity.",Oriana White,90,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,White Blend,Brian Carter Cellars
137135,Portugal,"Just turning in color, a wine that is beginning to mature. It has leathery texture over spice, ripe tannins and flavors of red fruit jelly. There is a bitter coffee character that melds easily into the tannins. It is a delicious wine, balanced and made for food.",Pegos Claros,90,14.0,Palmela,,,Castelão,Companhia das Quintas
137136,France,"A wine with some weight, but also fresh, clean and crisp fruit. The Pellé style is for very ripe grapes, expressing richness as well as the terroir.

137139,US,"From a single vineyard on Snipes Mountain, this is a forceful, dark and liquorous version of Harrison Hill, which often carries more herbal accents. Here it's fruity and floral, with scents of rose petals and concentrated raspberry and cassis. Still young and showing its alcohol, it needs some hours of decanting.",Harrison Hill,90,75.0,Washington,Snipes Mountain,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,DeLille
137140,Spain,"Full and dark, with aromas of bacon, crusty minerality, black fruits and spice. Balanced yet bullish, with integrated tannins and toasty, coffee-infused flavors that go straight to black. Long and showing additional coffee on the finish. Drinkable now.",Crianza,90,30.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Felix Callejo
137141,Argentina,"Deep as a country well, with lush black plum and blackberry aromas as well as lead pencil and balsam wood.

A pure, textbook modern red wine; drinkable now and over the next couple of years.",Gran,90,24.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Flechas de los Andes
137142,US,"A lean, steely and slightly herbaceous Chardonnay, whose brisk elegance makes up for the absence of richness.

Finishes clean, spicy and wonderfully dry.",,90,25.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Viognier,Ampelos

137145,Italy,"Here is a very impressive Rosso di Montalcino with thick, rich concentration and pretty aromas of black fruit, spice and cola. This is more than a “baby Brunello” as Rosso di Montalcino is sometimes called: it's a rich, steady wine that holds its own against some of the better wines of the region. The tannins are tight and firm.",,90,,Tuscany,Rosso di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Il Cocco
137146,Argentina,"A touch leathery and cooked at first, but with time the bouquet deftly blends saucy, savory Syrah aromas with sun-baked black fruit notes.

137148,Italy,"Although this Brunello is from the newly released 2005 vintage, it has aromas and textures that remind you of a wine that is older still.

There are also nicely integrated tones of exotic spice and mesquite wood at the back.",,90,,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Sesti
137149,US,"Dark, tannic and full-bodied, this five grape Bordeaux blend from a classic Washington vintage is 100% Alder Ridge fruit. This is a fine effort, cellar-ready and substantial.

137155,Australia,"Full and round in the mouth, this lacks the dynamic purity and luxurious texture of its pricier stablemate, The Duke, but it's still an excellent wine that blends black cherry and strawberry fruit with just a touch of spice.

137157,US,"When first opened, despite significant bottle age, it's a bit stubborn, tannic, hard, and showing some heat, iron, black olive, and earth. But with aggressive decanting (several hours at least) it begins to flesh out, opens up, and loses its alcoholic edge.",Solesce Red Wine,90,58.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Brian Carter Cellars
137158,US,"This is surprisingly fruit forward for a vintage that is often hard and unyielding. Big, ripe, round flavors of black cherry, plum, cassis and spice fill a round and tasty midpalate.

137162,France,"From old vines, partially destemmed and aged in old (3–10 years) barrels, this is a wonderfully pure expression of Cornas.

137163,Spain,"Broad-shouldered and muscled-up, this hearty wine seems more youthful than it is.

137164,Italy,"This is a gorgeous juicy-red-fruit driven wine with complex and interwoven nuances of blueberry, cherry, cookie dough, chocolate chip and soft vanilla oak playing a supporting role (the wines sees 18 months of oak).

137165,France,"Toasty upfront, with blatant oak and vanilla scents, but the wood is matched by the wine's fruity—raspberry and blackberry—intensity.

137166,France,"Comprised of fruit purchased from several growers and matured in only about 20% new oak, this is an authentic expression of Cornas, yet one with a surprising degree of elegance.

Drink now–2020.",Chante-Perdrix,91,,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Syrah,Delas Frères
137167,France,"Shows the wood from barrel fermentation and maturation a bit on the nose, but also plenty of citrus. It's broad, yet reined in a bit by oak spice right now, needing time to flesh out.

137169,Spain,"Bramble, cherry cola and snappy red berry aromas announce this as a secure, snappy wine.

137170,US,"Give this youthful wine some time to settle down. Tasted in late March, its parts had yet to mesh. The acidity, oakiness and fresh grapy flavors are at some odds with each other. By winter of 2007, it should be a fine, complex Chardonnay, and drink well for five years.",Bien Nacido Vineyard,91,28.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Stephen Ross
137171,Portugal,"The fine, ripe, structured character of Touriga Nacional is well evident here. It may be big in alcohol, but the wine wears that easily, going more for fresh tannins and acidity, for black currant and dark plum flavors and smooth, vanilla flavors from the French wood aging.",,91,100.0,Douro,,,Touriga Nacional,Quinta do Crasto
137172,Portugal,"Structured, rich, but also with good fresh acidity, this is one of the best wines in the Quinta do Portal range.

137173,France,"Denser and more minerally than Jaboulet's Les Grandes Terrasses bottling, this is a serious Cornas, brimming with blood and iron notes wrapped in a richly tannic cloak.

137174,US,"Big, raw and frankly not really showing its best now, this young Zin needs time in the bottle. It has everything that it takes for two or three years aging, at least. Aromas and flavors of crushed pepper, fennel seed and cardamom spice up the blackberry, roasted coffee and bitter chocolate flavors, while the tannins are hefty, but negotiable.",Feeney Vineyard,91,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
137175,Portugal,"From Aliança's Alentejo Terrugem vineyard, this dense, tannin-packed wine has powerful flavors of dark fruits, a very dry backbone and layer upon layer of tarry, smoky tastes. Initially it overwhelms with its richness, but that softens and the acidity gives the wine a lifted vibrancy.",Quinta da Terrugem,90,23.0,Alentejo,,,Portuguese Red,Caves Aliança
137176,New Zealand,"Drier-tasting and slightly more austere than the Fletcher Family Vineyard bottling, this Riesling from Craggy's own vineyard in Martinborough features zesty lemon and lime aromas and flavors backed by various spices, including ginger and clove. It's medium-bodied, with a long spice-and-citrus finish.",Te Muna Road Vineyard,90,24.0,Martinborough,,,Riesling,Craggy Range
137177,France,"Makes a splashy entrance, flashing hints of smoke, toast and vanilla, but there's a firm core of mineral and spice at the heart of this wine that will need some time to emerge. Right now the texture is rich, the red fruit forward, but the wine finishes a bit tough and crisp. Drink 2010–2018.",Les Eygats,90,65.0,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Syrah,Domaine Courbis
137178,France,"This is the 100% Syrah cuvée, and it shows powerful varietal character in its smoky, peppery, meaty aromas and flavors.

137179,France,"This ripe and creamy wine is full of great flinty and green fruit flavors. It is a pure, fresh expression of the chalk soil Sauvignon, with its crisp aftertaste.",Domaine les Grands Groux,90,19.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Fouassier
137180,US,"On a par with Beaulieu's reserve Pinots of the last several years, maybe a touch riper. Dry, round and supple, this well-oaked wine has cherry and cola flavors with hints of sautéed mushrooms and a dash of balsamic. Should hold for five years.",Reserve,90,40.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Beaulieu Vineyard

Pair with lamb with mint sauce.",St. Valentin,90,50.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Pinot Nero,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano
137182,Italy,"Deeply ruby, almost purple, in appearance, this is a thickly concentrated wine with a massive load of blueberry in center stage. Just enough room is left to allow delicate nuances of chalk, almond skin and garden herbs at the periphery. Excellent solid structure and good length on the finish make this a showcase Lagrein.",Porphyr Riserva,90,47.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Lagrein,Cantina Terlano
137183,France,"Powerful, intense and packed with rich green fruits, this is the top wine from Thierry Redde.

Drink now, or keep for another year.",Cuvée Majorum,90,,Loire Valley,Pouilly-Fumé,,Sauvignon Blanc,Michel Redde et Fils
137184,Australia,"Only contains 1% Viognier, so maybe the impression is subliminal, but there does seem to be a hint of apricot to this wine's raspberry-blueberry fruit and cracked pepper. It's medium-bodied, with firm acids but soft tannins on the finish. Drink now and over the next 8 years.",No. 89,90,45.0,New South Wales,Orange,,Shiraz-Viognier,Philip Shaw
137185,US,"With a greenish tinge to the straw color, this is an ultradry, very crisp wine, especially notable for terrifically clean vibrancy. Blended with 5% Verdelho, it shows strong lemongrass, grapefruit, wildflower, candied ginger, spice and mineral flavors that finish impressively long. Easily one of the best $10 wines of the year.",,90,10.0,California,North Coast,North Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Melanto Terrace
137186,France,"Fragrantly herbal and peppery on the nose, even coming a little close to vegetal before pulling back and showing more cherry fruit. This is a lightweight effort, but very pretty and perfumed, ideal for drinking while waiting for the blockbuster 2003 to mature. Drink now–2015.",,90,96.0,Rhône Valley,Côte Rôtie,,Syrah,Domaine Jamet
137187,France,"It's smoky, toasty and even a bit bacon-scented from its upbringing in 100% new French oak, but this is also a lush, warm, inviting mouthful of wine, filled with cassis fruit and framed by spicy wood. It's 95% Merlot from a hot vintage, so not likely to age all that long, but it's certainly delicious now.",Château de Launay,90,27.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Domaines Arnaud de Raignac
137188,France,"This grand cru Riesling screams of terroir.

137189,US,"Finally, a Zin that bursts with ripe, rich fruit, but isn't high in alcohol or sugary sweet.

Drink now.",Beeson Ranch,90,30.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
137190,Spain,"Slightly more leafy, herbal and burnt on the nose than ideal, but there's also tobacco, cherry and earth notes to keep it proper. The palate is smooth in feel, with good depth, while the flavor profile has a salty side as well as black cherry and molasses. Good wine with a few issues.",Crianza,87,24.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Pago del Vostal
137191,Spain,"Raisiny, sweet and baked, with plenty of oak coming on as it airs out. This vintage is somewhat syrupy and strained compared to prior years, with baked black fruit flavors.

137194,Germany,"Rich and succulent, with pineapple and jasmine top notes and intense stone fruit in the mouth.

137196,Italy,"Here's an attractively informal Prosecco from Adami with a sweet, creamy mouthfeel and pristine aromas of peach, honey and apricot.

137198,France,"Quite youthful, this is a sprightly and charming wine, evincing aromas of white flowers and peaches. The crisp palate has lemon-lime notes and a chalky edge. Medium, citrusy finish. Drink now or hold a few years for more complexity.",Kirchberg de Ribeauville Grand Cru Grande Reserve,87,33.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Cave de Ribeauvillé
137199,US,"Tough and chewy. Nonetheless there's a wealth of rich cherry pie, red currant and cedar flavor, and the mouthfeel is pure silk. A curiosity. May develop in the bottle, but probably best before 2013.",Poinsett La Encantada Vineyard,87,45.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Calicaro
137200,Spain,"Solid, big and fruity, which is basically what a Campo de Borja Garnacha should be. Sweet red fruits and robust kick define the palate, which is tannic but not obtrusively so. Zesty and a bit of a one-noter, but a nice one. Garnacha with 30% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre.",Lot 98,87,10.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Red Blend,Cameron Hughes
137201,France,"Aging this wine in 100% new wood has left it very dry, the fruit tight and black but oddly drained of richness. There is sweetness along with prune flavors. But the tannins may never soften enough.",Vieilles Vignes,87,22.0,Bordeaux,Haut-Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Landat

137204,Spain,"Dry, dusty and minty on the nose, with cherry, cedar and sweet oak notes. The palate has a hard, clangy bite to it, while the flavors run toward herbal cherry and dried tobacco.

137211,Italy,"Masottina's Brut Prosecco is an easy and forthcoming sparkling wine with a light but crisp mouthfeel and drying aromas of mineral, stone fruit and white flower. It's tonic and crisp, and those are two fine qualities that would work well with cheesy or fried finger foods.",Brut,87,24.0,Veneto,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,,Glera,Masottina
137212,US,"A dry, well structured Bordeaux blend. Speaks volumes for the winery's efforts to wrest real complexity and style from these rugged, hot Foothills. Shows proper blackberry, black currant and herb flavors, with a balanced touch of oak. Ready now.",,87,25.0,California,El Dorado,Sierra Foothills,Meritage,Miraflores
137213,New Zealand,"Smoky, cedary and, frankly, a bit dominated by oak. It's nice oak, and the fruit is rich in body and thick in texture, just slightly muted. Perhaps an additional year or two of cellaring will see the oak integrate more and the fruit come forward.",Reserve,87,,Waiheke Island,,,Syrah,Mudbrick
137214,US,"This is a pretty good Cabernet, although it's a little direct in its appeal. Flatters the palate with strong flavors of blackberries, currants, dark chocolate and oak, with rich tannins and a long, fruity finish. Flamboyant, if not particularly complex. Drink now.",,87,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Girard
137215,France,"Dense and flavorful, with decadent tones of honey, honeysuckle, baked apples and pear tart. The palate is concentrated and fairly dry, though a bit lacking in fruit. Try with roast pork. Drink now.",Mise du Printemps,87,22.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Blanc,Josmeyer
137216,Spain,"Opens with peach and apple aromas that are 100% normal, while the palate has a chiseled clarity to it that's crisp and appreciated. A flavor profile of dry apple, citrus and dusty spice is good, and the finish is fresh and lemony. Drink right away.",,87,17.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,La Caña
137217,US,"Strong and ripe and oaky. Not showing much subtlety, but a very good example of the modern California style. It's a clean, vibrant Chardonnay starring massive flavors of pineapple tart, Meyer lemon custard and tangerines, brightened with zesty acidity.",Genevieve Vineyard,87,30.0,California,Guenoc Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Chardonnay,Langtry
137218,France,"Unusually subdued nose of pear and mineral leads to a nuanced palate of pear, papaya and kiwi that's noticeably sweet. There could be more flavor and persistence though a high level of concentration is evident. A good complement to spicy Asian food. Drink now.",Letzenberg,87,55.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Jean-Baptiste Adam
137219,US,"A rich, fruity Viognier that shows its sunny, warm origins in the ripe array of tropical fruits, wildflowers, honey, vanilla and spices, and also in the softness. Easy to drink and quite enjoyable, especially as a cocktail wine.",,87,23.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Viognier,Hawley
137220,US,"Give this Cab extra points for the dazzle factor. It shows the most beautifully ripe flavors of blackberries and cassis, and a powerful but tasty coating of smoky oak. The tannins are so sweet and fine, but the excessive softness robs the wine of structure.",Reserve,88,95.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ledson
137221,Austria,"Whites from red wine specialist Umathum are rare, but then so is Pinot Gris in Austria. This wine has a racy quality, topped with spice that sets it apart from its nearest comparison, Alsace. There is a touch of wood as well as the spice, lively and fresh to finish.",,88,25.0,Burgenland,,,Grauburgunder,Umathum
137222,US,"Lots of zesty Carneros acidity in this young Pinot that impresses for its silkiness and ripe fruit flavors.

137223,US,"Here's an intense, nervy young Cab that impresses for its powerful oak and cassis flavors. It's a little sharp now, with an acidic jamminess and tea-like tannic structure that suggests moderate aging capability. Stash it until 2008, then open for a couple of years.",Reserve,88,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Raymond
137224,Austria,"From a vineyard right in the city of Krems, this Grüner is all spice and mineral; very fresh, elegant, green and crisp. It's probably an early drinking wine, delicious now and for the next 3–4 years. Glass stopper.",Wieden Tradition,88,22.0,Kremstal,,,Grüner Veltliner,Salomon-Undhof
137225,Italy,"Pio Cesare's Langhe 2004 is more open and easier to taste than the 2003.

137226,US,"With 20% Semillon, this is a very rich wine, partly barrel-fermented and aged on the lees. It's packed with ripe, fruity peaches, pineapples, green apples, melons, figs and dates. It's a little sweet, but zesty acidity comes to the rescue to provide balance and elegance.",,88,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Duckhorn
137227,US,"This is a tight, rather austere style of Merlot, but has muscle and nerve. Winemaker Charlie Hoppes has kept a slightly green edge to the tannins, which are well-managed and taste good, while adding length and firmness to the back end.",Estate,88,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Gamache
137228,France,"This wine is beginning to get some age to it, but remains fresh. There is some toast, even coffee, while the aftertaste is soft and slightly candied.",Blanc de Blancs,88,48.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Duval-Leroy
137229,US,"This is sharply perfumed, with an edgy, tight consistency that seems to emphasize both the floral and the bitter rind aspects of the grape. Viognier can fall off a cliff rapidly, and this latest vintage, though complex and complicated, has a hot intensity that pulls in the bitterness and loses the citrus. If that's the style you like, this is a fine, concentrated and intense rendition.",,88,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Viognier,Alexandria Nicole
137230,US,"Cool fermented in stainless steel and whole cluster pressed, this lively take on Pinot Gris offers rich pear fruit flavors, succulent and fresh.

137231,Austria,"Full and rich, maybe missing some acidity, but replacing that with powered white nectarines. The pepper, though, causes the wine to fall short, giving it an edge. It needs time to develop properly—give it 2–3 years at least.",Smaragd Steinterrassen,88,30.0,Wachau,,,Riesling,Machherndl
137232,Austria,"A lively, fresh wine that only just borders on sweetness, reserving some the botrytised fruit for richness instead. There are fine flavors of lychees, crispened up with white currants, while spice comes through but well in balance.",Schenkenbichl Auslese,88,34.0,Kamptal,,,Grüner Veltliner,Jurtschitsch
137233,US,"There are some exquisite flavors in this Cab Franc: cassis, cherries, raspberries, cocoa, smoky oak and a rich array of dusty crushed brown spices. The wine is fully dry, with finely meshed tannins, but the main quibble is that it's too soft to be completely balanced.",,88,48.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Ledson
137234,France,"This is a heavy, rather clumsy wine, that seems to be too soft. The weight shows through the almonds and green plum fruits, while the acidity seems somewhat forced. To finish, the softness returns. Bottle age may help this wine to liven up.",Fleur de Champagne Brut,88,140.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Perrier Jouët
137235,France,"The softness of the 1999 vintage is very apparent in this approachable wine. It is full, round, only just touched by minerality, white fruits and some almonds giving weight and character.",Cuvée Millesimé Grand Cru Brut,88,62.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Pierre Moncuit

137240,US,"Apex has just released this 2002, which makes it, as far as we know, the last of that vintage to see daylight. Dark and smoky, it is already heading into more mature, secondary fruit flavors, and has a pleasing softness throughout. Time has sanded away the rough edges of the tannins, and rounded out the herbal components as well. This is drinking very nicely, and gives you a cellared wine at a new wine price.",,88,30.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Merlot,Apex
137241,US,"Sonoma Valley Cabernet specialist Cohn reaches to the Russian River to expand his portfolio with this Pinot Noir. It's not a stretch to call it Bordeaux-style. Although it has the variety's telltale silkiness and medium body, the blackberry, cola, coffee, leather and oak flavors, not to mention the tannins, possess density and gravity, which may make this wine ageable. Best now through 2011.",,88,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,B.R. Cohn
137242,US,"Better known for Cabernet Sauvignon, Charles Krug has a good track record for Merlot, too, and their '04 is quite a rich wine.

137245,France,"An intensely herbal, thyme-flavored wine, with a creaminess that enhances the full, but still very fresh character.

137247,US,"This is Duckhorn's signature vineyard for Merlot, located off the Silverado Trail below Calistoga. It's also the winery's most variable Merlot, showing distinct vintage variation. The 2004 was a warm vintage, and the wine is soft and voluptuous in pie-filling cherry, raspberry and blackberry flavors. But it doesn't have the tough tannins that cooler vintages show.",Three Palms Vineyard,88,85.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Duckhorn
137248,Italy,"The Il Falchetto offers lovely aromas of fresh peach, honeysuckle and lime peel. The palate is more delicate but the wine is beautifully balanced, and initially, there is more than enough intensity of flavor. But as it moves towards the finish, it begins to run out of steam.",,88,21.0,Piedmont,Langhe,,Arneis,Il Falchetto
137249,US,"This estate-grown Cabernet shows good concentration and a stylish mix of fruit, leaf and herb across the palate. There are subtle notes of tomato leaf, bark and earth, along with black currant and blackberry fruit. The tannins are smoky and substantial, with a green tea edge to them. The wine is finished at under 14% alcohol, and it captures the sort of varietal character that cannot be found in superripe, superhot New World wines.",,88,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gordon Brothers
137250,Australia,"Shows some nice complexity, marrying earthy undertones with tart berry fruit and peppered meat, but comes across as crisp—verging on lean—before falling away on the finish. A bit European, or at least cooler-climate, in style.",,87,30.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Shiraz,Koonowla

137254,Argentina,"Solid, basic Malbec with plenty of fruit and power. The palate is plump, mildly oaked and tastes of honest plum and blackberry. It's ripe and round, with medium tannins and then spice, licorice and black fruit on the tail. A very good wine with no skipped beats.",Reserva,87,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tamarí
137255,Argentina,"Tight, rubbery and smoky at first, and then it shows more vanilla and sweet berry fruit after it has opened up. The mouthfeel is nice and fulfilling, while the flavors of black fruit, nutmeg and mild toast are pleasing. Nothing too exotic or out of the ordinary here. Just good red wine at a good price.",,87,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Septima
137256,Argentina,"Mostly it's clean and neutral smelling, but there is a bit of candle wax and peach to the nose as well.

Don't expect miracles and it should be pleasing.",,87,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Tilia

137259,Argentina,"Ripe, healthy and pure, with familiar aromas and flavors of cassis and berries. In the mouth, it's bright and lively, with plenty of acidity but no sheering, harsh qualities.

137261,Italy,"This is a super-intense wine that might not appeal to everyone. The aromas are wide reaching, immediate and recall almond Amaretto, candied orange, brown sugar and molasses. The wine is chewy and soft in the mouth and leaves strong marzipan flavors and a playful touch of sweetness.",,87,19.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,Friulano,Antico Broilo
137262,Argentina,"A little jammy and heavy at first, but airing gives it better focus. The palate runs full and lush, with sweet tannins running alongside blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. Holds it together on the finish, but overall the wine is more generic than individual.",,87,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alamos
137263,US,"Dry and tannic in youth, with a jammy, somewhat heavy mouthfeel, this wine, from a sub-appellation in Lodi, might benefit from a year or two in the bottle.

137274,Spain,"Dried fruit, a touch of compost and then bold coffee and mocha aromas give the wine a decent nose, and the palate, while zesty and snappy, is endowed with pretty good raspberry, cherry and strawberry flavors.

137297,Portugal,"Aveleda's more traditional Vinho Verde is still perfectly fresh, with crisp green plum and grapefruit flavors. A blend of Trajadura and Loureiro, it is fresh but full-bodied with good intensity of fruit. Imported by Aveleda Imports.",Grinalda,88,9.0,Vinho Verde,,,Portuguese White,Aveleda
137298,Italy,"A very luscious, ripe—any more ripeness would bring it over the top—and muscular Nero d'Avola redolent of cherry, prune, cigar box and toasted notes. It's soft and smooth in the mouth with dusty tannins. Imported by Paterno Wines International.",Piana dei Cembali,88,32.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Nero d'Avola,Baglio di Pianetto
137299,Germany,"Full-bodied for a Mosel wine, at 12% alcohol, but tasty, offering rather bland apple  or melon flavors but dusted with enough spice and mineral notes to add considerable complexity. Long, spice-driven finish. Imported by Magellan Wine Imports.",Blauschiefer QbA,88,23.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Immich-Batterieberg
137300,New Zealand,"Starts off well, with aromas that strike a pretty balance between gooseberry and passion fruit, then layer on ripe melon and nectarine as well. In the mouth, it's big, delivering bold, fruity flavors underscored by crisp acids. It lacks a bit of elegance and length on the finish, but this wine delivers plenty of flavor and pleasure for the price. Imported by Quintessential LLC.",,88,13.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Mount Riley
137301,New Zealand,"Features some slightly smoky, flinty notes on the nose, then gives up flavors of wet stones, limes and hard peaches on the dry, full-bodied palate. Crisp and tart on the finish. Imported by Davies & Co.",,88,15.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Trinity Hill
137302,Italy,"This is a very successful Insolia-Chardonnay blend that is creamy in the mouth— like a banana smoothie—and nicely layered with peach pie, exotic spice, pineapple and tomato leaf aromas. Imported by Panebianco.",Bidis,88,25.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,White Blend,Valle dell'Acate
137303,Chile,"Very ripe and tropical, with a candied core sweetness that is hard not to like. Pear, vanilla and toast coast the new-age bouquet, while the palate oozes nectarine and cantaloupe. Clean and moderately deep. Features good natural acids. Imported by T.G.I.C. Importers.",Alpha,88,23.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Montes
137304,Italy,"This is a heavily toasted Nero d'Avola that puts blackberry and plum on equal footing with vanilla, roasted nuts and wood notes. It's a New World-style wine made with an Old World grape. Ends with dusty tannins.",Terre di Ginestra,88,19.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Nero d'Avola,Calatrasi
137305,Italy,"The most likeable aspect of this wine is how faithfully it mirrors the land it comes from. In the spring, Sicily is blanketed with wild fennel and if you pay close attention you'll smell it on the nose of this Nero d'Avola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot blend. That dill-herbal touch translates over to the mouth with pine and resin flavors; there's both the softness of the Merlot and the muscle of the Cabernet. Imported by Vin Divino.",Noé,88,28.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Red Blend,Cusumano
137306,Italy,"Just released but already mature and composed in presentation (20% sees oak), this Nero d'Avola and Syrah blend has rich aromas of milk chocolate, blackberry, earth and moist tobacco with moderately soft tannins on the persistent finish. Imported by Vin Divino.",Benuara,88,15.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Red Blend,Cusumano
137307,Germany,"Seems sweet beyond the normal bounds of kabinett, but despite the high sugar levels, there's also a dry, dusty stoniness to the finish that provides a sense of balance. Crushed stone, green apple and lime scents lead the way, followed by riper apple, pear and honey flavors on the medium-weight palate. A candidate to match with spicy or slightly sweet Asian dishes.",Hochheimer Hölle Kabinett,88,17.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Domdechant Werner
137308,Italy,"This is a truly delightful 50-50 Nero d'Avola-Syrah blend with an inky-purplish color and penetrating aromas of menthol, fennel seed, cherry or currant and cough drop. Extracted in color and flavor, it has a defined personality and a zippy, clean finish with soft tannins. Imported by Epic Wines.",Rosso delle Rose,88,20.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Red Blend,Masseria del Feudo Grottarossa
137309,US,"From a cool part of the appellation comes this dry, potent wine, rich in gooseberry, pink grapefruit, fig and lemongrass aromas. Zesty, citrusy acidity makes this fruit-forward wine perfect with a salad of mixed bitter greens, chevre, toasted walnuts and a creamy raspberry vinaigrette.",Slusser Road Vineyard,88,17.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Hanna
137310,Austria,"Tiny quantities of this wine were produced in '03 and again in '04. It is an impressive wine, with intense sweet apricot and honey flavors, still giving fine, fresh acidity to balance the dense texture.",Loibenberg Trockenbeerenaulese,93,,Wachau,,,Riesling,Dinstlgut Loiben
137311,US,"This wine is immediately fascinating. A rich mix of fruits, ripened to compote intensity, offers both power and detail. Subtle streaks of herb, leaf and wet hay suggest old-vine complexity, and the acids are naturally firm and supportive. Everything is nicely knit together, full-bodied and deep.",Old Vines Dedication Series #23,93,75.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Woodward Canyon
137312,Austria,"A very intense, full-flavored wine, with structure and minerality the dominant characteristics. There's certainly acidity in this youthful wine, but it is the intensity of flavors that will eventually—give it four years—shine through.",Zöbinger Heiligenstein,93,36.0,Kamptal,,,Riesling,Bründlmayer
137313,US,"Brilliant exposition of Chardonnay from a cool climate. There's a brisk, clean, minerally moutheel, brimming with acidity, that frames exotic flavors of ripe tropical fruits, spices, peaches and vanilla-infused cream, and a finish that turns to pure apricot nectar. Just delicious.",Ashley's Vineyard,93,28.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Fess Parker
137314,Chile,"The Chadwicks have hit the big time with this superb Cabernet-dominated blend. The bouquet of black cherry, charcoal, plum and tree bark is sensational, while the cassis, cherry and tobacco flavors sing on the palate. Lots of fruit, power and balance, with a touch of earthiness.",Viñedo Chadwick,93,100.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Blend,Errazuriz
137315,Australia,"This is a wine that would benefit from further bottle aging: Just a little earth and anise come through on the nose. It's tightly wound all around—a little lean, even—but pleasantly so, its juicy, tangy black cherry flavors and lively acidity dominating at this stage. Supple and layered on the palate and through the finish. Drink 2008–2012.",Heytesbury,93,50.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Cabernet Blend,Vasse Felix
137316,Austria,"This is Markowitsch's flagship wine, from the Rosenberg vineyard. The blend varies from year to year, but always includes at least 50% Zweigelt, along with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. This 2003 is as powerful and intense as is to be expected from a wine of this vintage, but is saved by its structure. It is rich, ripe and very open, with damson, black currants and creamy wood flavors blending well together.",Rosenberg,93,,Carnuntum,,,Red Blend,Markowitsch
137317,US,"This is from the cooler, southern portion of the valley, and the climate shows in the notable tannins and acids that put the wine in lockdown. Yet it's a very fine Syrah, rich and classy in meaty blackberry and coffee flavors and a luscious finish of blueberry tart. You could enjoy this single-vineyard wine now, but it should soften and develop additional bottle complexities from 2007 through 2010.",Trenton Station Vineyard,93,35.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Lost Canyon
137318,Italy,"This dessert wine ventures far beyond classic dried fruit and nuts to offer fresh peach, apricot lavender, lemon rind, dried basil and pine nuts. It has a winning combination of herbs and sweetness that recalls tea with honey and lemon. Made from late-harvest (as late as November) and very rare Moscato Reale grapes.",Apianae,93,19.0,Southern Italy,Molise,,White Blend,Di Majo Norante
137319,Australia,"Tasted alongside other South Australian Cabs, this one is distinguished by its restraint and elegance. The nose has a nice briary quality; the palate has well-integrated tannins, and flavors of red fruit and eucalyptus. Medium in body, and very juicy through the long finish.  Drink now–2013.",Shadrach,93,50.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Grant Burge
137320,Austria,"This intensely sweet wine, almost like nectar, is so fresh and poised, that it is both overwhelming and refreshing. Honey marches with acidity, smokiness and perfumed fruit.",Hölzler Welschriesling Eiswein,93,35.0,Niederösterreich,,,Welschriesling,Weinrieder
137321,Austria,"Big, fat and opulent as befits a wine produced in a winery owned by the Burgundian Cistercian order. The tropical fruit flavors are dominant, but still attractively balanced with lively, fresh acidity.",Zöbinger Heiligenstein,93,36.0,Kamptal,,,Riesling,Schloss Gobelsburg
137322,US,"It's 99% Sauvignon Blanc, with a splash of Viognier. The wine is really a wonderful barrel-fermented style, rich, unctuous and exotic in citrus, nettle and wildflower flavors. It's wines like this that are making Sauvignon Blanc a certified superstar.",T-bar-T Cuvée R,93,24.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Iron Horse
137323,Austria,"Famed as a cult wine in Austria, this lives up to its billing. It is powerful but elegant, with juicy, herbal flavors, blackberries, damsons and a smooth, cocoa coating. But there is certainly structure here from the tannins. Like so many Triebaumer wines, this will age magnificently.",Mariental,93,,Neusiedlersee-Hügelland,,,Blaufränkisch,Ernst Triebaumer
137324,US,"This is one of the best Pets I've had this year. It's dry and compellingly delicious, a subtle wine of great intricacy, from the blackberry and coffee flavors to the smoothly tannic structure to the classic finish, but be forewarned: The alcohol is 15.9%.",,93,22.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Petite Sirah,Ursa
137325,US,"A wonderful nose of violets and mixed fruits, with hints of Asian spices. Long and seamless, textural and detailed, it leads into flavors of boysenberry, blueberry and cherry. The oak is very nicely applied, and the wine keeps coming at you with flavors of Bourbon barrel, soft soy, balsamic and moist earth, all beautifully integrated.",Red,93,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Quilceda Creek
137326,US,"Years ago I found out how good these Sierra Foothills Cab Francs can be, and here's another one. It really impresses for its dry finesse, a wine that exhibits true gout de terroir in the earthy, mushroomy flavors with their subtle hint of black cherries and violets. Try as an alternative to Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot.",The Scrapper,93,30.0,California,El Dorado,Sierra Foothills,Cabernet Franc,Vinum Cellars
137327,Austria,"From 50-year-old vines, harvested at the end of November, this wine has definite late-harvest richness and intensity of flavor. Fruit tastes are less obvious than the perfumes, the flavors of almonds and complexity, what Friedrich Rieder calls a wine with character.",Alte Reben,93,24.0,Niederösterreich,,,Grüner Veltliner,Weinrieder
137328,Australia,"This wine gets 14 months oak aging, and two and a half years of bottle age; this is the current vintage. Hats off to Franz for making a completely different sort of Barossa Cabernet. That it's under 13% alcohol is just the tip of the iceberg; there's cola, black pepper and plum flavors, and aromas of spice and leather. Feels fresh and spry, but its age has also given it hints of maturity.",Georgie's Walk,92,40.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,David Franz
137329,US,"Soft, smooth, rich and supple, this delicious blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc also includes a dash of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. There's loads of black cherry and blackberry fruit flavor, but beyond that the wine shows real stuffing. It gently evolves in the mouth, opening up to reveal layers of tobacco, cherry, tar and light smoke.",Ursa Red,92,29.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Baer
137330,US,"The appellation is a distinct bench on the west side of the Salinas Valley, and this fine Pinot has benefited from the cool winds and long hang time. Marked by bright acidity and intense cherry, cola and spice flavors, it's a dry, rich wine, with a silky texture and enough complexity to age through this decade.",,92,35.0,California,Arroyo Seco,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Carmel Road
137331,Italy,"In contrast to Tommasi's regular Amarone, this is a darker, richer, more brooding wine, loaded with chocolaty, fudge-like flavors and roasted fruit. It's mouthfilling and supple, with a lingering finish that bodes well for cellaring, although it's certainly approachable now.",Ca' Florian,92,68.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Tommasi
137332,Austria,"Salomon makes wines from the vineyards they have rented from the Metternich family on the Pfaffenberg. This is a beautiful floral wine, flinty and crisp. It also shows supple acidity, fruit flavors and a long, intense aftertaste. Expect this to age well.",Pfaffenberg,92,,Kremstal,,,Riesling,Metternich-Salomon
137333,Austria,"There is some wood here, particularly to smell, but it forms a seasoning for the intense concentrated flavors. Mandarin oranges and some smoky minerality are mixed in a creamy, rich blend. An impressive wine.",Hundsleiten,92,,Niederösterreich,,,Grüner Veltliner,R&A; Pfaffl
137334,Austria,"The second harvesting pass through the vineyard in 2004 produced the grapes for this wine. The purity of the fruit flavors are the most striking thing about this delicious and impressive wine. Flavors of white currants vie with hedgerow fruits, lychees and  almonds.",Bockgärten II,92,29.0,Niederösterreich,,,Riesling,Weinrieder
137335,US,"An extraordinarily rich Pinot, fat and opulent in cherry compote, mocha and root beer flavors. Generously oaked, it offers spicy oak notes and a velvety texture. It's a big, fruit-forward wine, but manages to maintain delicacy and harmony throughout. Best now through 2008.",Laetitia Vineyard Clone 667,92,48.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Malvolio

137337,Austria,"Kracher's fame rests on the series of cuvées he makes, which increases in intensity the higher the number. In 2003, the series was broken because of the dry year and the lack of botrytis, and only one wine was made. It certainly has exceptional power from the heat of the year, with raisins as much as botrytis on the palate, and relatively low acidity.",Cuvée No 1. Nouvelle Vague Trockenbeerenauslese,92,72.0,Neusiedlersee,,,White Blend,Kracher
137338,US,"Smooth, hard and glossy, with tightly wound fruits dappled with light herbs. The mix of plum, cherry, coffee and earth is perfectly balanced, and the wine shows good density and extract. Grapes are from Red Mountain, Walla Walla and Horse Heaven.",,92,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Hightower
137339,US,"Here's a big, rich, mouthfilling Chard. It's superoaky, superripe and just delicious, offering up a wealth of mango, guava, pineapple custard and peach pie fruit, with the crème brûlée, buttercream and buttered toast from new oak. Really good Chardonnay.",Bell Mountain Vineyard,92,20.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Medlock Ames
137340,Italy,"This blend of Sangiovese and Merlot is almost too black, too concentrated and too extracted. Aromas are of blackberry pie and chewy tannins leave a gritty impression in the mouth.",Quadrimendo,85,18.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Tenuta Vitanza
137341,Spain,"This wine is a “product” in every sense of the word. It's consistent from year to year, and if you know Esmeralda, with its sweet blend of Moscatel and Gewürz, then you know that it delivers simple but pleasant lime, kiwi and cantaloupe flavors with a certain watery freshness.",Viña Esmeralda,85,15.0,Catalonia,Catalunya,,Moscatel,Torres

137343,Spain,"While we'd suggest waiting for the 2007 to hit the market, this softer-styled wine is showing mature melon, tropical fruit and bee's wax aromas in front of mild citrus, lemon and pineapple flavors. It has a medium-weight body and almost a honeyed roundness. Drink now.",,85,10.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Analivia
137344,Italy,"This Sangiovese from a hot vintage definitely seems past its peak. It has a very sweet-smelling, cherry-driven nose with a touch of marmalade that is blasted by a sudden rush of oak wood.",Birba,85,29.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Sangiovese Grosso,La Gerla
137345,US,"Not one of the best Cabs from this venerable winery. Despite a cool vintage, there's a burnt edge to the blackberry pie filling flavors. Tasted in late 2007, the tannins are very astringent, and shut down the palate. Could show better after 2008.",,85,38.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ferrari-Carano
137346,Germany,"Much lighter in weight than many Pinot Gris on the market, this is a pretty, fruit-driven rendering of the variety, blending tropical fruit with ripe apples and hints of pink grapefruit. It's crisp and clean on the finish.",Grauer Burgunder Kabinett Trocken,85,19.0,Pfalz,,,Pinot Gris,Dr. Wehrheim
137347,Spain,"White raisin and touches of lettuce and celery give this multigrape blend some richness but also a bit of green character. The palate shows lemon, green apple and pineapple, and this lean quality is confirmed by the wine's modest 11% alcohol level. Drink now to catch it at its scouring, sorbet-like best.",Versatus,85,10.0,Galicia,Ribeiro,,White Blend,Bodegas Campante
137348,Spain,"Matchstick, mushroom and licorice nib aromas add character to this fading but textured wine that struggles to offer peach and nectarine flavors.

137349,US,"With a honeyed edge of sweetness to the pineapple and lime flavors, this wine also has a zesty acidity that makes it finish with mouthwatering cleanness.

137353,France,"Round and soft, this has fresh, attractive fruit, flavors of white pears, candy and green herbs. Just a touch of sweetness in the acidity of the aftertaste.",Mouton Cadet,84,9.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Blanc,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Baron Philippe de Rothschild
137354,Spain,"Dry black cherry and berry fruit shows some early chemical accents, and the wine stays sort of thin and hard all the way to the end. It's peppery and tight, with a simple dark-fruit personality. A little awkward at 14.5%.",Crianza,84,16.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Barzagoso
137355,US,"A rustic Merlot. The cherry, cassis and chocolate fruit flavors are so powerful, they swamp the wine, leaving elegance behind and making it indelicate.",Red,84,18.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,American Roots
137356,US,"At first pass, this feels a little tired, with a somewhat feeble nose and flavors that could tend toward bitter. But in the mouth, the wine impresses—the fruit is pretty and round, the mouthfeel smooth. Spice and fruit come together nicely and chase away any austerity that may be lurking. The finish is good and layered.",Reserve,84,15.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay,Castel Grisch

137361,US,"Exotic pepper and hearty spices lead on this asserive wine from Macari.

137362,US,"Comes down on Petite Sirah's rustic, slightly sweet side. Even though the alcohol is pretty high, there's a sugary, porty finish to the blackberry and cherry jam flavors. The wine also has the bigtime tannins you expect from this variety, and should age for several years.",Le Vigne di San Domenico,84,29.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Petite Sirah,Sylvester

137368,Israel,"With fairly muted fruit flavors and a hint of green pepper, this lighter-bodied and easy-drinking wine will pair well with most meat or chicken entrées.

137370,US,"The 2006 flagship Cabernet from Quilceda Creek is a massive wine that has just begun to emerge from its slumber. When first released the wine seemed to have entered a dumb phase, but six months later it responds to decanting and shows its muscle. Fruit flavors of black, brandied cherries, cassis and bourbon-soaked plums are wrapped in generous, layered oak. The wine is dusty, smoky, laced with streaks of licorice and brightened with sharp acids. It continues to expand further in the glass, adding flesh and spice to its frame, with a cedar/cigar box finish.",,98,125.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Quilceda Creek
137371,Italy,"Guado al Tasso is finally back. After a string of past vintages that exhibited some rubber-like aromas, the 2006 expression is a study in purity, focus and excellence.

137373,Italy,"Consistently among Italy's top-scoring wines, this vintage of the celebrated Ornellaia (a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot) is a gorgeous expression of the very best of European enology.

137374,US,"This very dense, tannic Pinot Noir represents a triumph for both the winery, the vintage and the region it represents. A multi-clone blend (hence the name) with high, cool-climate acidity and aged in 100% new oak, it's still young, fresh and tight. The astringency throws a cloak over the raspberries, cherries, rosehip tea and Indian spice flavors, which reveal themselves only reluctantly. But they're there, in an imposing texture of velvet and silk. This enormous wine demands time. The window seems to be 2012–2015.",Ten,97,80.0,California,Sta.

It's utterly distinct from other Pinots in its almost feral complexity, a wine that changes with every sniff and sip. Should develop through 2014. This is a great price for a Pinot Noir of this integrity and interest. Only 152 cases were produced, but it's worth the search.",Hellenthal Vineyard,96,40.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bjornstad
137377,US,"It's hard to consistently get scores this high year after year, but Greg Bjornstad does, because he understands Pinot Noir.

This 2007, from an esteemed vineyard, is spectacular in wild forest cherry, cola, licorice, pine cone, anise, exotic spice and sandalwood flavors, even as it's perfectly balanced with crisp acidity, fine tannins and just-right oak. Lovely and complex. Now–2014.",van der Kamp Vineyard,96,40.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bjornstad
137378,US,"All the oaky, leesy richness is there, with buttered toast, crème brûlée and smoky buttercream, and tons of fruity ripeness, with a blast of Meyer lemon, pineapple, white peach and apricot. Yet there's also a firm, steely minerality, and, despite the dryness, maybe even a delicious touch of botrytis. The acidity is mouthwatering.",,96,34.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Boekenoogen
137379,US,"This first estate-grown bottling of Rediviva is 55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 45% Syrah. Amazing aromatic complexity grabs you and leads you into the dark interior of the wine, a riot of red and black fruits, moist earth, smoke, anise, herb and toast. Power and elegance combined, with the structure to age for a decade or more.",Columbia Rediviva,96,48.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,Buty
137380,France,"Almost black in color, this is a wonderful wine with a long development ahead. At the moment, wood is still too dominant, but just taste the weight of the darkest plum and sweet fig fruit flavors, a line of licorice and bitter coffee and huge, dry tannins.",Le Cèdre,95,60.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Château du Cèdre
137381,US,"A fabulously rich and approachable Pinot Noir that offers everything now, yet will also age. The considerable tannins will protect it in the cellar for a good 6–8 years, but it's so fresh and vibrant in cherries, red currants and oak-inspired red licorice that it's hard not to drink it now. Hard to exaggerate the deliciousness factor.",Southing,95,50.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Sea Smoke
137382,US,"A real success story for this hot vintage. Feels gracious and generous in the mouth, offering complex, fat flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, mocha and cedar that turn spicy on the finish. The tannins are elaborately ripe and fine. The well-known vineyard is on the Rutherford bench, and production was 2,300 cases. Drinkable now, and should age well for at least a decade.",Sycamore Vineyard,95,70.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Freemark Abbey
137383,Australia,"The 2007 Astralis impresses for its combination of power and nuance. It's dark and almost tarry in concentration, but floral and bright at the same time. Layers of dark coffee and earth are balanced by red fruit, and although it's full bodied and rich in texture, the finish introduces delicately herbal, tea-like notes. Best from 2014–2025.",Astralis,95,225.0,South Australia,Clarendon,,Syrah,Clarendon Hills
137384,US,"Beautifully floral, fragrant and evocative, with lush and complex aromas of honeycomb, cracker and citrus, carrying into the mouth with rich, bright, detailed flavors. Stone and mineral elements are woven throughout, and the barrel fermentation adds hints of toast.",Sémillon-Sauvignon-Muscadelle,95,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,Buty
137385,US,"A massively constructed Chardonnay that's opulent and concentrated and bursts in the mouth with pineapple, lemon drop candy, Asian pear and white peach flavors of enormous ripeness. The entire production of 108 cases was aged in new oak, so there's a lavish veneer of sweet, smoky buttered toast. Sur lie aging is evident in the creaminess and ever so slight sourdough tartness that adds a piquant touch. This impressive Chard is at its best now in its flashy, flamboyant youth.",Pastorale Vineyard,95,100.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Freestone
137386,US,"To call this a big Cab would be an understatement. It's a black-colored, saturated wine that detonates on the palate, offering a blast of black and red berries, currants, cassis, dark unsweetened chocolate, anise and fine, upscale new oak. But the tannins are fierce. Very fine, among the best St. Helena Cabernets of the vintage. Needs time. 2012–2020.",Estate,95,100.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sabina Vineyards
137387,US,"A spectacular Pinot Noir, but you don't want to open it anytime soon. Shows the pedigree of this vineyard, a superbly balanced wine rich in acidity and minerals. The fruit? Black and red cherries, blackberries, cola, cocoa powder and red currants, enriched with smoky cedarwood. Beautiful, but needs time. The window is 2011–2013.",Fiddlestix Vineyard,95,70.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Paul Lato
137388,Italy,"With its extraordinary texture, bright personality and complex medley of aromas, this is a lovely Merlot. The aromatic layers here include red cherry, earthy tones, exotic spice and cinnamon. The mouthfeel is smooth and gorgeous with delicious softness and opulent richness. Drink after 2015.",Galatrona,95,120.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Merlot,Fattoria Petrolo
137389,US,"You can quibble with the price, but there's no doubt about the quality of this Zin. It's extraordinarily deeply flavored, offering waves of wild cherries, cola, anise, molé sauce, pepper spice and sandalwood, wrapped into profoundly fine tannins, and with a long, dry finish. Drink this near-perfect Zinfandel over the next six years.",Old Hill Single Vineyard,95,60.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ravenswood
137390,US,"Among McCrea's Rhône-inspired white wines, this is the most complete and complex. It's rich and dense, with honeycomb, lychee, lemon rind, pineapple and lots of stone—lovely and lingering. It seems to gain strength as it rolls through a sensational finish.",Boushey Vineyard Sirocco Blanc,95,25.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,White Blend,McCrea
137391,US,"This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from the Wallula vineyard, made by Gilles Nicault of Long Shadows. A tight, focused, pure, firm, classic Cabernet Sauvignon, it offers bucket loads of sweet cassis and cherry fruit, sculpted with crisp acids and polished tannins. A big, supple bottle that gracefully unwraps itself to show streaks of graphite, licorice, smoke and coffee; it could pass for a cult Cab from one of Napa's great boutiques.",Andreas,94,80.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Den Hoed
137392,US,"A magnificent wine for its lush opulence and dramatic structure. Shows concentrated flavors of red and black sour cherry candy, red currants, coffee, dried herbs, anise and sandalwood, wrapped into gorgeously soft, refined tannins. Very fine and complex, and will age well. 2012–2018.",St. Eden,94,275.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,BOND
137393,Italy,"Thanks to its excellent quality and universal appeal, you can count on Tignanello to make an excellent impression with any elegant meal. Based on Sangiovese, with a small percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine delivers an interesting power play that pits cherry fruit against vibrant spice. It is tight and firm in the mouth with a slightly sweet or soft note on the close.",Tignanello,94,95.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Marchesi Antinori
137394,Austria,"One of Austria's most successful Pinot Noirs, exhibiting both the wild cherry and jammy red berry fruits of the grape and also impressive Burgundian tannic structure. It is big, dense, powerful, a juicy streak of acidity giving a powerful element. Age for 3–4 years.",Unter den Terrassen zu Jois,94,65.0,Burgenland,,,Pinot Noir,Umathum
137395,US,"Quite a noble, interesting wine that bears comparing with the best of Napa Valley. It's bone dry, with softly dusty tannins backed with a firm hit of clean acidity. The flavors are somewhat herbal, with a sage and tobacco edge to the blackberries, dark chocolate and graphite. Feels classy and important, but young. Better after 2012.",Pickberry Vineyards,94,50.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,Ravenswood
137396,France,"Despite the 100% new wood, this wine (GC stands for Grand Cru) is beautifully restrained. It has such delicious fruit and the ripest of tannins, pierced with the wood flavors, but never dominated by them. It is obviously a wine for aging, still bursting with fresh fruit and acidity.",GC,94,135.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Château du Cèdre
137397,US,"The Poet's Leap Riesling continues its string of outstanding vintages, once again exceptionally concentrated and complex. The high-acid 2008 vintage adds extra juicy vibrancy to the fruit, giving the wine an impression of dryness (though it is a bit over 1% residual sugar) and a dense, layered fruit component. A mix of old vine and German clones, this is a superb effort.",,94,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Riesling,Poet's Leap
137398,Austria,"A highly perfumed wine from old vines, aged for 24 months in wood. The tannins are dusty, with wood very present but not overwhelming the fruit. It is rich and structured, but also sophisticated and elegant, with final ripe black fruits showing well.",Dürrau Cuvée,94,,Burgenland,,,Blaufränkisch,Weninger
137399,US,"This big, young Pinot should have been held back before release, because it's really tannic and primary now, making its future hard to evaluate. However, it seems a likely cellar candidate. It's fresh in acids and clearly has a pedigree of terroir, showing mineral-infused raspberries, cherries, rhubarbs, wild strawberries, and pomegranates, accented with rich, smoky oak. The texture is pure silk, and the finish is firmly dry. Give it until 2012, at the very least.",Bill and Joan's Special Selection,94,75.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,W.H. Smith
137400,France,"In the fat, buttery style of white Burgundy, this wine, with its malolactic flavors and its vanilla flavors, would appeal immediately to California Chardonnay lovers. Except that it also has elegance: a hint of steel and a touch of acidity to temper the tropical fruits.",Les Chenevottes Premier Cru,92,70.0,Burgundy,Chassagne-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Domaine Bernard Moreau et Fils
137401,US,"From one of California's greatest Sauvignon Blanc producers comes this very interesting wine from a well-regarded part of the appellation.

With fresh acidity, it's right up there with the best.",Purisima Mountain,92,25.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Brander
137402,US,"Chards are tight, acidic and minerally in youth, showing a lees-infused structure but offering waves of complexity.

137403,Italy,"This comes from a 1.6-hectare (4-acre) vineyard in Serralunga solely owned by the Doglianis. Floral notes grace the nose, picking up leather and plum flavors. Rich, deep and supple on the palate, this was by far the most impressive of the Batasiolo wines we recently sampled. Aged in barrique.",Vigneto Corda della Briccolina,92,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Beni di Batasiolo
137404,US,"This may be the most expensive Malbec in California, but it's a really good wine that is full-bodied and deeply flavored. Like a great Cabernet, it shows polished black currant, spicy plum and new-oak flavors, with wonderfully rich, sweet tannins and soft acids. So easy to drink, so delicious now, but you might try cellaring it through 2010.",Reserve,92,60.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Malbec,Chateau St. Jean
137405,Argentina,"Charcoal and ripe berry fruit announce this as a serious, masculine Malbec. The palate answers the bell, delivering tight blackberry and cassis flavors in front of a tannic, sturdy finish. Shows great foundation and potential; best in late 2007 into 2008.",Punto Final Reserva,92,18.0,Mendoza Province,Perdriel,,Malbec,Bodega Renacer
137406,France,"From the Bouchard domaine, this wine is soft and ripe. There is some structure and firm acidity, but that's secondary to the luscious flavors that roll around the mouth. The wood broadens but also gives extra complexity to the wine.",Les Gouttes d'Or Premier Cru,92,84.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Bouchard Père & Fils
137407,Germany,"Plump and succulent, this is a deceptively easy wine. Ripe apple, pear and melon flavors make it seem simple, but underneath the flesh is a spine of bright acids and slatey minerality. Zesty lime and ripe orange notes give length to the crisp, lingering finish. Both this wine and the auslese are great.",Brauneberger Juffer-Sonnenuhr Spätlese,92,26.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef)
137408,Austria,"I had a slight preference for Högl's less expensive Loibner Vision Riesling Smaragd, but you can't go wrong with this one either. Thick, viscous and full-bodied, it's richly fruited but minerally as well, marrying diesel and smoke notes with orange and tangerine flavors. Long and spicy on the finish.",Ried Bruck Viessling Smaragd,92,38.0,Wachau,,,Riesling,Högl
137409,France,"This is a really good rendition of this extra-tart, austere style of Champagne. Citrus and steel are the prime components—don't look for tropical fruits, toast or buttered nuts in this baby. This is a terroir-driven wine; it tastes like the chalk it's grown in. Can you say oysters and caviar? How about triple crème cheeses, foie gras, etc.? Made for the richest food you care to throw at it.",Ultra Brut,92,60.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Laurent-Perrier
137410,US,"A new wine from veteran Rick Longoria. It combines both cool climate and warmer aspects, showing ripe, forward, almost jammy cherry and cassis fruit as well as the acidity and tannins associated with, say, Santa Rita. It's a compelling wine, complex and delicious.",Alisos Vineyard,92,32.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,Longoria
137411,Germany,"A bit sulfury on the nose, but even through that veil it's possible to discern greatness. Citrus, melon and pear notes shine through, picking up mineral notes on the long finish, while the texture is plump but with elegant underlying structure. Drink 2010–2020.",Abstberg Spätlese,92,28.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Maximin Grünhäuser
137412,US,"What a beautiful, balanced, succulent wine. It's mostly Syrah and Mourvèdre, with a dash of Grenache for spicy cherries. As delicious as it is right now, it has a good, medium-range shelf life ahead. With a texture of silk and velvet, it's one of those wines that just feels important in your mouth.",Z Three Red Wine,92,40.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,Zaca Mesa
137413,US,"Well oaked, with a toasty, vanilla-infused cream and caramel edge, this polished Chard has peach custard flavors dusted with cinnamon, nutmeg and candied ginger. It's delicious and complex. The word “rich” doesn't begin to do it justice.",Pugash Vineyard,92,45.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Mi Sueño
137414,Germany,"Rock hounds will adore this wine, which shows off the dry minerality of the Abstberg. Crushed stone, spice and melon scents are fleshed out and embellished on the palate by honeyed notes of pineapple and dried fruit. Persistent citrus, honey and mineral notes linger elegantly on the finish.",Abstberg Auslese,92,40.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Maximin Grünhäuser
137415,France,"Chenevottes is situated high up on the Chassagne-Montrachet slope, above the grand cru vineyards. With its fat, ripe butter and coconut milk character, this wine offers an immediately appealing style. But there is a hint of ageability in its layers of serious wood and structure.",Les Chenevottes Premier Cru,92,49.0,Burgundy,Chassagne-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Louis Latour
137416,US,"This is Eola Hills fruit, though the label simply says “Oregon.” It carries some of the region's characteristic youthful aromas of tomato leaf mixed with moist earth. Plenty of acid provides good definition; right now it's got all the right components but they remain angular and separate. The stiff and lean tannins indicate that this will benefit from some cellaring.",Seven Springs Vineyard,92,49.0,Oregon,Oregon,Oregon Other,Pinot Noir,Rex Hill
137417,France,"A wine that caresses the palate with initial silky, ripe-fruit flavors and then comes on with structure and acidity. The wood shows through but certainly doesn't dominate. A wine that has power, but also great charm.",Les Genevrières Premier Cru,92,,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Domaine des Comtes Lafon
137418,France,"Rich and spiced with wood flavors, this is a rounded, powerful wine. The flavors suggest kiwis and pears leading to vanilla and caramel. It is developing well and is ready to drink.",Morgeot Premier Cru,92,56.0,Burgundy,Chassagne-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Domaine Lamy-Pillot
137419,France,"Still tasting young, and not yet showing all its power, this is still an impressive wine. It is firm and structured, with citrus and mineral flavors dominating the concentrated fruit. The wood shows through via a warm spiciness. This will certainly age for 5 years or more.",Les Folatières Premier Cru,92,103.0,Burgundy,Puligny-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Etienne Sauzet
137420,Austria,"Incredibly sweet and syrupy, this is an intense dessert wine from one of Austria's masters of the genre. Dried apricots dominate, but there are also complex notes of roasted coffee, orange marmalade and dark honey. Long on the finish, with enough acidity to keep it from being cloying. For the quality, the price makes it a relative bargain.",Ruster Ausbruch Essenz,92,50.0,Burgenland,,,White Blend,Feiler-Artinger
137421,US,"Ripe, smooth and delicious, this Cab offers tiers of blackberry jam, plum sauce, chocolate, licorice and oaky spice flavors. It's so soft, so beguiling, and despite the fruity power it's elegantly structured. A wine to savor as it warms in the glass. It wears its high alcohol well.",Broken Rock Vineyard,92,36.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bighorn
137422,Austria,"Given the prices for top Austrian Rieslings, this represents a bargain. It's rich and intense, with hints of honey, spice and smoke that twine around a core of powerful mineral flavors. It's capped off by a long, mouthcoating finish.",Spitzer 1000-Eimerberg Smaragd,92,28.0,Wachau,,,Riesling,Gritsch Mauritiushof
137423,Austria,"Big, rich and oily, with intense aromas of smoke and nut oil that build on the palate into flavors of peach kernel, spice and layers of minerality. A long, mouthcoating finish cinches this wine's quality. The only catch is that of 800 cases produced, only 25 are scheduled to be imported to the U.S.",Hohenberg,92,23.0,Donauland,,,Grüner Veltliner,Josef Ehmoser
137424,US,"A worthy followup to the '03, this rich, intricately layered Syrah is fresh in jammy fruits and dusty tannins, although it's not a hard, tannic wine. If you think of a great Napa Cabernet and shift the flavor profile toward red cherries, pomegranates and pepper, that's it.",Goat Rock,92,28.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Taz
137425,France,"This shows the more racy, fresh side of Meursault. It's a wine that dances and jumps around the mouth. Light but still full of delicious green fruits. The wood is there, but it's such a delicate touch.",Genevrières Premier Cru,92,84.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Bouchard Père & Fils
137426,US,"The wonderfully bright, citrusy acidity pushes and brightens the citrus, melon and fig flavors. It's such an expressive wine, so bold and well-structured. No oak seems to have been added, but no matter, the wine is so rich, clean and fruity that it doesn't need it. Just brilliant California Sauvignon Blanc.",Church Vineyard,92,19.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,John Anthony
137427,US,"The vintage was a very good one for Calera, offering the heat needed for ripeness but the cool nights for acidity. Mills is a ripe, delicious wine with blackberry, cherry, cola, mint and spice flavors resting on a complex, multi-layered palate that finishes firm and dry. Supple now, it should drink well for ten years.",Mills Vineyard,92,43.0,California,Mt. Harlan,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Calera
137428,France,"This is a classy package, and the wine lives up to it, showing extra dimensions of power and weight. The flavors are layered and unfold gracefully; apple to citrus to pineapple. Then it slides into stone, chalk and fennel, moving finally to a nicely etched, crystalline clarity as it slowly fades across the palate.",Grand Cru Brut,92,60.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,G. H. Mumm
137429,US,"There are tannins here, but they're so soft, polished and sweet that they help the wine glide down, adding a textural dimension to the cherry, blackberry essence, cola, coffee and oaky vanilla flavors. It's an expensive wine, but a really fancy one.",,92,70.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Merlot,Duckhorn
137430,US,"Lovely lemon drop and tangerine fruit creates a juicy, vibrant mouthfeel, with a baby aspirin/orange candy streak running down the midpalate.

137431,France,"The Duboeuf family property on the edge of the village of Juliénas produces a satisfyingly full-bodied wine, its fruit and tannins offering balance and ripeness. Acidity and cherry flavors are dominant over the dry core.",Château des Capitans,90,,Beaujolais,Juliénas,,Gamay,Georges Duboeuf
137432,US,"Inviting, fresh, racy scents mix pineapple, citrus and light tropical fruits. There is an interesting mouthfeel not unlike Sémillon, though none is indicated in the blend. The wine has substantial length and unusual highlights of spice, clove and mint, along with plenty of rich, ripe fruit to hold down the center palate. Not shy at 14.8% alcohol, this is a fine effort from consulting winemaker Charlie Hoppes.",Estate,90,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Goose Ridge
137433,France,"A wine on the crisp, mineral side, bringing out some flintiness while also showing pear juice fruit flavors. There is a strong texture here, leaving a final tight acidity.",,90,,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Cherrier et Fils

137436,Italy,This is a beautiful red blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon from the Montalcino subzone of Sant'Antimo (where super Tuscan wines are made) with light mineral dustings that show delicately over a solid core of black fruit and exotic spice. The mouthfeel is bright and polished.,Ateo,90,34.0,Tuscany,Sant'Antimo,,Red Blend,Ciacci Piccolomini d'Aragona
137437,Italy,"This is a very likeable and approachable Brunello with soft but generous tones of cherry fruit, exotic spice, pipe tobacco and cedar wood. In fact, those exotic wood notes transfer to the mouth where the wine is smooth and enduring with a sweet cherry finale.",,90,60.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Capanna
137438,Italy,"This Brunello has an edgy, raw feel that translates into aromas of white cherry, wild raspberries and violets.

Pair it with creamy or cheesy dishes.",,90,,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Molino di Sant'Antimo
137439,US,"A very nice Pinot that shows the classic elegance associated with this producer. It's one to drink now.

137440,US,"Pure varietal, this estate-grown Malbec from Snipes Mountain (central Yakima Valley) is deep and fascinating, with luscious plum and berry flavors accented with floral highlights.

137441,Spain,"Very dark and oaky, with lemon, bacon, charcoal and high-toned black fruit aromas. The palate is rich and warm, almost heavy, with intense blackberry, chocolate and figgy flavors.

137442,Portugal,"A blend of Alvarinho and Trajadura, this combines a creamy texture with bright green fruit acidity. There is weight as well as freshness, the aftertaste rich while also crisp.",Varanda do Conde,90,,Vinho Verde,,,Portuguese White,Provam
137443,US,"It's pretty chilly at Roche's Carneros vineyard, and this wine is not one of those superripe Syrahs. It shows a nice array of cherries and berries, but is also very peppery, with a fine note of grilled, charred beef on the bone. It's a complex, pleasing wine for drinking now with upscale fare.",,90,26.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Syrah,Roche
137444,US,"This is a big, extracted, dense wine whose muscularity makes it a bit too oversized now. It's all primary cherries and raspberries, sweet red currants and sandalwood, and also is quite acidic and tannic. Feels clumsy and jagged, but that's a function of extreme youth. Cellar for 5–6 years, and it should be fine.",Babcock Vineyards,90,62.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Pacific Coast
137445,US,"Good price for an upscale Chardonnay this rich and interesting. It's oaky, with vanilla and buttered toast flavors, but the underlying pineapple and Meyer lemon fruit easily supports the wood, while brisk, refreshing acidity provides balance.",,90,22.0,California,Arroyo Seco,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Mercy
137446,US,"A flamboyant Chardonnay. Shows flashy scents of vanilla and buttered toast from oak, riding high over pineapple, pear, golden mango and nectarine fruit.

137448,Spain,"Dark, sweet and candied on the nose, with hints of raisin and licorice that become more prominent in the mouth. Saturated but also somewhat monotone and single-leveled in terms of flavor, where you get a narrow band of sweet black cherry and raisin in front of a short finish. Very nice as always, but not the best Allende we've reviewed.",Allende,89,26.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Finca Allende
137449,US,"Very good price for a Riesling of this quality. It's very dry and high in acidity, cleansing the palate and stimulating it to appreciate rich fare, from liver paté on toast to grilled trout or chicken satay. Or delicious on its own, with fresh citrus, apricot and peach fruit flavors.",,89,14.0,California,El Dorado County,Sierra Foothills,Riesling,Jacella
137450,France,"An edgy, mineral style, full in the mouth, with fruit flavors that definitely go towards pear and apricot and away from herbaceous. It's a great style that allows the wine to age, with a firm texture to go with the fruit.",Les Belles Vignes,89,27.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Fournier Père et Fils
137451,US,"This Sangiovese-dominated blend displays herb, olive and earth components wrapped around supple, well-modulated red fruits. This does not have the Sangiovese character that one finds in Tuscany, but it's a very well-made, food-friendly red blend that is drinking well right now.",Tuttorosso Red Wine,89,30.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Brian Carter Cellars
137452,Argentina,"A joint venture between the Renacer winery of Argentina and Chile and Allegrini from the Veneto in Italy. Thus it makes sense that this five-grape blend is done in the Amarone style, with concentrated, dried grapes. Aromas are generous, minty and floral, and the palate is jammy and concentrated. Rich and a little raisiny, just like Amarone. Drink now.",Enamore,89,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Bodega Renacer
137453,Portugal,"A wine with good richness and weight, the crisp fruit softening into a more mature character, but still retaining a bright, tight acidity. It has good weight and would work well with food.",Real Senhor Velha Reserva,89,,Vinho Espumante de Qualidade,,,Portuguese Sparkling,Borges
137454,France,"An impressively ripe wine, full of Cabernet Franc trademarks, such as spice, fruitcake and red berry fruits. It is structured, firm, hinting at wood, and finishing with bright acidity.",L'Enchentoir 253,89,35.0,Loire Valley,Saumur,,Cabernet Franc,Manoir de la Tête Rouge
137455,South Africa,"Everything about this white smacks of elegance: the slatey, citrus nose, the clean, refreshing slate, asparagus and lime flavors, the flinty, lemon-lime finish. Reserved and poised, it's fresh with a light, minerally touch. Pair with ceviche, oysters or sip on a hot summer day.",,89,12.0,Simonsberg-Stellenbosch,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Le Bonheur
137456,Italy,"Here is a modern Brunello with an obvious wood or oak-related element that sits on top of blackberry, mature cherry, raspberry and cola. It's a plush, dense and modern wine with loads of mature berry fruit and lingering tones of smoke and spice.",,89,45.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Ventolaio di Fanti Luigi
137457,US,"A dry, streamlined wine, for those who don't like super-fruity, oaky ones. With a streak of minerals, it shows an elegant structure framing citrus, melon and peach flavors.",,89,28.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Thomas Fogarty
137458,Spain,"A well-made and refreshing wine for the price. The nose is crisp and smells of nettles, grapefruit, cilantro and stony minerals, while the feel is zesty and the flavors bring a mix of green fruits, citrus and tropicality. Stays on point from start to finish. A fine wine for summer sipping.",,89,15.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Palacio de Bornos
137459,Italy,"What stands out here is the purity and elegance of this wine's fruit-driven bouquet. This is a Rosso di Montalcino, but it drinks almost like a Brunello (which is by law aged more years in the cellar) thanks to its sophisticated style and integrated spice notes. The main difference is that you can taste the wine's youth here.",,89,,Tuscany,Rosso di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Molino di Sant'Antimo
137460,France,"Approachable now for its juicy red fruit and intense minerality, this is a superb example of Cornas from a challenging vintage. It's not deeply colored, but still boasts plenty of intensity to its aromas and flavors, with supple tannins and a long, spice-driven finish. Drink now–2014.",,90,,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Syrah,Dumien-Serrette
137461,Italy,"Here is a gorgeous and very fragrant Pinot Bianco with loads of stone fruit, floral and mineral nuances. Spicy acidity livens up the mouth and is fueled by the wine's creamy and smooth consistency (one third is aged in oak). This is a very drinkable wine: Try it with shellfish, pasta, white meat or with appetizers.",Kastelaz,90,21.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Pinot Bianco,Elena Walch
137462,US,"Shows the better side of Paso Syrah, with a white pepper and sweet leather note to the cherry, blackberry and black raspberry fruit. The wine is soft and dry, with just enough acidity and tannins for structure, and a very long, persistent finish. Drink now.",,90,28.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Syrah,Falcone
137463,Australia,"There's a greenish tinge to this wine's fruit, but it also features complex minerally elements, so the end result is something like fresh ferns, crushed stone and fresh-squeezed limes. It's plump in the mouth, yet sharply focused, finishing crisp and refreshing. Imported by USA Wine West.",Watervale,90,29.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Riesling,Grosset
137464,France,"After 30 months in new oak, this needs some time to pull itself together. Right now, it's dominated by oaky notes of vanilla and spice. There does appear to be plenty of old-vine material underneath—you can ferret out hints of apricot and almond skin—so this rating may look stingy in 10 or more years.",Ex Voto,90,175.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Rhône-style White Blend,E. Guigal
137465,France,"A spicy, muscular example of Hermitage, this wine features red currant flavors tinged with darker shades of cassis and chocolate. It's slightly creamy in the mouth, turning dry and tannnic on the finish. Drink 2010–2020.",,90,80.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,E. Guigal
137466,Chile,"A standout Casablanca Valley Sauvignon for $15? Yes. Right from the start the pure, defined citrus and grass aromas draw you in. After that, the grapefruit on the palate is clean and quenching, while on the fringe there's a hint of pickle and green apple. Overall it's a wine that pushes the right buttons.",Aguas Frescas,90,15.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Chilcas
137467,Italy,"One of Italy's best Rieslings, this is a classic rendition of the variety with trace sweetness and opulent notes of citrus, stone fruit, white mineral and a touch of natural rubber. It ages on its lees in stainless steel for four months, which explains its creamy consistency: very enthusiastically recommended.",,90,18.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Riesling,Alois Lageder
137468,France,"Like the 2005, this is a nutty wine, but it is also a touch crisper and should prove to be marginally longer-lived. Broad and mouthcoating, with layers of richness.",,90,75.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Marsanne,Marc Sorrel
137469,US,"This large vineyard, in the hills of eastern Napa, is source to many wineries, and now Surh Luchel dips into the pot. This is a very good wine, dry and classically structured, with thick but finely ground tannins and ripe flavors of black currants and new French oak. A touch of asperity in the finish warrants against aging.",Stagecoach Vineyard,90,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Surh Luchtel
137470,Chile,"One big step up from the value level is this classy, succulent Malbec from Odfjell, a winery whose successes far outnumber its duds. Expect opening aromas of toasted coconut, black cherry, mocha and even fresh mushroom. The palate is blazing with sweet berry and plum flavors, and then chocolate and coffee take over on the finish. It's the full package in terms of Chilean Malbec; about as good as it gets. Only 254 cases made.",Orzada,90,18.0,Lontué Valley,,,Malbec,Odfjell
137471,New Zealand,"Peg Bay continues to push the ripeness envelope on its Rieslings. The 2006 is honeyed and rather sweet, with baked apple flavors at the core, surrounded by hints of spice and apricot. Lime-like acids seem a bit strident on the finish right now; give it a couple of years in the cellar. Imported by Meadowbank Estates.",,90,23.0,Waipara Valley,,,Riesling,Pegasus Bay
137472,Portugal,"The Quinta da Leda is high up the Douro, in the remote regions of Douro Superior. This 2004 shows the concentration of the fruit in the dark tannins, the toasty new wood and the ripe dark plum fruits. It is smooth enough to drink now, but the tannins promise 5–6 years aging.",Quinta da Leda,90,60.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Casa Ferreirinha
137473,US,"Nice, dry and complex, a crisp wine with quite a bit of minerality undergirding the fruit and oak. Feels fine and balanced in the mouth, and should take a couple years in the cellar.",,90,30.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bouchaine
137474,US,"Soft and generous in fruit, this wine needs a good steak to show its stuff. It's dry, with a gentle scour of tannins framing earthy blackberry, cherry, blueberry, orange zest and oak flavors, and a dustiness that calls Rutherford to mind. Grows in the glass.",,90,28.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Falcone
137475,France,"Shows superripe, almost jammy aromas of cherries and plums, but those are balanced by sprinklings of minerals and spice. Creamy on the palate, the wine gains focus on the finish, where it leans toward cranberries and dusty tannins. Hold until 2012, at least.",,90,,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Syrah,Domaine du Tunnel
137476,France,"From vines more than 50 years old, this is a surprisingly lush, forward Cornas from a vintage known at most domaines for its hard tannins. Black cherry fruit surrounds a core of dense mineral flavors, with light touches of wood on the finish. It's approachable now but should easily hold until at least 2015.",Empreintes,90,,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Syrah,Éric & Jöel Durand
137477,France,"This is a powerful, rich white Hermitage with overtones of buttered nuts. It's slightly waxy, with hints of stone fruit as well. Already shows some hints of age, so this may be best consumed young.",,90,50.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Rhône-style White Blend,E. Guigal
137478,France,"Very spicy, but also possessing enough cassis and cherry fruit to make a wonderful marriage. The lovely velvety texture just turns a tad dry on the finish; give it five years in the cellar.",,90,75.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,Marc Sorrel
137479,Spain,"Dark mineral, toasted French oak and black fruit carry the nose. This is a sturdy, nicely made high-end Rioja, but due to the heat of the year its range of flavors is narrow as it settles on baked plum and molasses. Medium long on the finish, with a lasting taste of chocolate.",Dalmau,90,100.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Marqués de Murrieta
137480,Chile,"Manso ranks among the biggest, most historic and most consistent Chilean Cabernets going. The 2004 isn't perfect but it exhibits classic old-vines blueberry and cassis aromas and flavors. There's not too much obvious oak and the tannins seem a little soft. Which means it's more or less ready to drink now (ahead of the '03).",Manso de Velasco Viejas Viñas,90,32.0,Curicó Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Miguel Torres
137481,US,"Easy to imagine drinking this with a really nice lamb dish or grilled steak. It has an upscale feeling, with a complex interplay of tannins and oak, and the flavors are long, lush and liqueur-like. However, it's soft, and not ageable.",,90,40.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Moon Mountain Vineyard
137482,France,"A crisp, steely wine, with piercing fresh pink grapefruit flavors. There is a wonderfully clean, refreshing character to this wine, livened with acidity and green fruits.",Cuvée de Boisfleury,90,,Loire Valley,Pouilly-Fumé,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine A. Cailbourdin
137483,Australia,"Mostly barrel-fermented in French oak, this is a smoky, nutty Chardonnay that successfully integrates the wood with pear and honey notes. The texture in the mouth is rich and layered, ending long and tinged with roasted nuts. Drink now–2010.",No. 11,90,30.0,New South Wales,Orange,,Chardonnay,Philip Shaw
137484,Portugal,"Old vines in this case means 70-year-old vines. Featuring blackberry fruit flavors, along with plums, sweet and rich, this shows a dense, herbal character, dry tannins, lifted by acidity to finish.",Reserva Old Vines,90,40.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Crasto
137485,France,"A delicious and richly creamy wine, full-bodied, with green plum and pink grapefruit flavors. There's freshness, but also power. Still young, just bottled, this wine will develop over 4–5 years. Les Pentes, slopes, refers to the slope of the vineyard.",Les Pentes,90,23.0,Loire Valley,Pouilly-Fumé,,Sauvignon Blanc,Serge Dagueneau et Filles
137486,France,"A bit light, in the style of the vintage, but with wonderfully intricate spice complexity wrapped around leather and red fruit. The creamy mouthfeel gives this wine a sense of delicacy not often found in Hermitage. Drink this pretty wine over the next 7–10 years.",,90,75.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,Marc Sorrel
137487,France,"Slightly herbal on the nose, without the great intensity of some vintages, but still having pretty peppered raspberry aromas. This is a bit light in weight, but wonderfully supple, elegant and well-balanced. Finishes long, with silky tannins and a touch of cranberry. Drink now–2014.",,90,91.0,Rhône Valley,Côte Rôtie,,Syrah,Michel & Stéphane Ogier
137488,US,"A solid effort. Dry and lush, this wine has deliciously forward flavors of cherry liqueur, crème de cassis, milk chocolate, blueberry jam and toasty oak flavors that taste as good as they sound. It's ready now and for the next year or two.",,90,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,Rutherford Hill
