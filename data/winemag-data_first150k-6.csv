62499,US,"With its soft, melted mouthfeel and superripe blackberry marmalade, cherry sauce and cherry-chocolate flavors, this Zin exemplifies east side Paso. Many such wines are simple, sweet and rustic, but Kent Rosenblum lifts this one by making it dry, with layers of chewy, herb complexity.",Appellation Series,87,18.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Rosenblum
62500,Australia,"Displays plenty of cola and earth aromas upfront, balanced by hints of pepper and a core of blackberry fruit. A solid, medium-bodied effort that's not overweight or overripe, just a nice, easy-drinking Shiraz with some earthy character.

62503,Spain,"Hints of peanut and caramel vie with mineral and acacia blossom for center stage on the nose, while the palate deals nut skins, lime, kiwi and gooseberry.

62504,US,"Even by Albariño standards, this is a particularly dry, acidic wine. It's what you look for, and what you get, in this wine from Bonny Doon's Randall Grahm. From the east side of Salinas Valley, the wine brims with tart lime zest and tangerine fruit, with a pungently peppery edge of nasturtium flower.",Ca' del Solo Vineyard,87,18.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Albariño,Ca' del Solo
62505,US,"Albariño's natural acidity is amplified in this wine, which comes from one of California's chilliest growing regions and the coolest vintage in years. Consumed on its own, the acidity is so high, it's almost sour. But this is a food wine if ever there was one. With salty tapas, it will be perfect.",Estate,87,24.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Albariño,Cambiata
62506,US,"Tart and smoky, showing some brick around the edges and a bit of volatility in the nose and mouth. This does not have the depth of fruit to support the oak and acid; it's chalky and tart at the same time.

62509,France,"As befits its provenance from the hands of the winemaking team of Château Haut-Brion, this is a solid, finely crafted wine, flavored with mint and layers of wood as well as red plums. With these tannins, it could even age a year or 2.",,87,22.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Clarendelle
62510,Spain,"This is a nice, traditionally styled Rioja. Delivers smooth, earthy, leathery aromas and then spicy dry fruit that's right out of Rioja 101.

62511,US,"This is a big step up from recent vintages. Though it still carries an undertone of musty/chalky bark (from overly aggressive maceration?) it doesn't bury the fruit, and actually drinks quite well. 17% Merlot, 3% Syrah, 3% Malbec.",Genesis,87,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hogue

62534,US,"Released at the unusually old age of nearly five years, this Pinot Noir is quite acidic. That gives a tart bite to the cherry, cola and oak flavors.

Top Value.",Estate,91,30.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rochioli
62579,US,"It's said that Dick Arrowood personally checks every bottle that goes out—his attention to detail shows here. A complex and refined bouquet of toasted oat, coconut, orange and peach opens to a full palate of apple, yellow plum and caramel flavors. Rich and creamily textured, it is also high on spice and smoky oak. The complex finish is very long, leesy and elegantly nuanced.",Reserve Speciale Cuvée Michel Berthoud,91,38.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Arrowood
62580,Australia,"Opens with aromas of black soil, mint and cola. Its acids are lively, its cherry fruit tight, and an undercurrent of eucalyptus ties it all together—all characters that you either love or you don't. The wine has a lot going for it, though, and is worth a look. Imported by Southland Wines.",,89,16.0,Victoria,Pyrenees,,Shiraz,Blue Pyrenees
62581,Italy,A subdued note of soybean and water chestnut backed by candied pear washes through to the back of the palate with a mineral finish.

62582,US,"Good, solid, chunky aromas of berry and chocolate lead into ripe, spicy raspberry and cherry fruit. The wine is loaded with creamy, milk chocolaty oak. Smooth and broad, it coats the palate. Though not a deep or textured effort, the fruit and smooth mouthfeel make for plenty of near-term enjoyment. There is just enough weight to give the impression of extra ripeness, a plus in this price range.",Vintners,89,20.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Merlot,Kestrel
62583,US,"Here's a rarity—pure Walla Walla Ttempranillo—dark, gamy and exotic. It instantly fascinates you from the first sniff.

The fruit is light and tastes of roses and cherries.",,89,28.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Tempranillo,Seven Hills
62584,US,"As with the Merlot this is Ash Hollow fruit (92%), hence young; it seems to represent a significant shift in style from previous Reininger wines.

62585,US,"Looks as golden pale as a classic brut, but the full-bodied, ripe flavors of cherries and cassis-infused cream give it away as Cabernet Sauvignon.

62590,US,"This little-sung (outside of Washington) winery makes an eagerly-awaited rosé of cabernet franc each spring, but here is the real deal. One hundred percent varietal, it puts the lie to the notion that cabernet franc must be tannic and tough.

62596,Australia,"Deep inky-red in color, this Shiraz's name is an easy clue to how it behaves in the mouth. It's a wine to be reckoned with, full and round.

62598,Australia,"This is a young Cab, not meant to be drunk for another 3–5 years at least. At this stage, it takes a long time in the glass to reveal its black cherry, eucalyptus and soil flavors; its tealike tannins reign for now.

62605,US,"Colored a deep green/gold, this thick and viscous Chardonnay is packed with flavors of peach, apricot and tropical stone fruits.

62672,France,"Yes, that Mouton Cadet has been transformed into a clean fresh wine featuring notes of apple and citrus and touches of earth and herb. A blend of 50% Semillon, 40% Sauvignon Blanc and 10% Muscadelle.",Mouton Cadet,84,8.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Blanc,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Baron Philippe de Rothschild
62673,US,"A difficult wine to evaluate, as it's young and unresolved. Has tobacco and mint aromas, with some cherries. Closed and on the palate shows some cassis and lots of oak. Tannins are big and astringent. Seems to lack fruit.",Beckstoffer Tokalon Vineyard,84,75.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Behrens & Hitchcock

62678,Spain,"Heavy and high-voltage, with a strong whiff of green bean to the nose.

Tight on the finish, with lots of tobacco and bell pepper.",Gran Reserva,84,25.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,LAN
62679,Spain,"A Monastrell with 10% Cabernet, and it is heavily minty and woody, with leaner than expected fruit and a whole lot of resin and vanilla setting things off.

62682,Spain,"Some heft and richness propel this bargain wine to a higher level. There are even some bacon, beef and leather aromas in addition to the plump fruit scents.

62694,France,"Begins with modest apple and nectarine scents, then delivers bland stone fruit flavors in a plump, low-acid format that's easy to drink, as long as it's well chilled. Shows the ripeness of the 2003 vintage, but lacks concentration.",,84,10.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Blanc,,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,J. D. Laurent

62697,Spain,"Nice in terms of texture, but a bit strange and hard to identify as far as aromas and flavors go.

62704,New Zealand,"The equal of Villa Maria's Keltern Vineyard Gewürztraminer for its grace and balance.

62706,Spain,"A blend of 65% Merlot with 35% Tempranillo;  the nose offers olive, black plum and a touch of resiny young oak.

62708,US,"With 1% residual sugar, this Muscat straddles the line between a table and a dessert wine. I'm classifying it as the former, because it's crisp and minerally, but you could certainly enjoy it with a fruit tart.

62715,Australia,"This wine poses an interesting contrast to the regular bottling, as it's lower in alcohol and also tighter and more structured.

62716,US,"Dry and rather tough in tannins, this may be one to cellar. It shows bitter cherryskin, cola and tobacco flavors, enhanced with oak, in a smooth, complex texture.

62725,US,"You'll want to stick this Bordeaux blend in the cellar because right now the tannins dominate. There's a very rich vein of cherry, currant, cassis and new oak flavor, and the wine is totally dry, but those tannins give it a sticky astringency that obviously calls for time out.

62726,US,"Good, rich Cab from this veteran producer, but falls shy of greatness.

62728,US,"Like most Pinots from this Monterey appellation, this is a big wine, the kind that garners high scores from critics for its Rubensesque stature.

Give it 5 years.",Las Alturas Vineyard,87,50.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Belle Glos
62729,US,"The underlying wine in Beringer's '05 Reserve is a rich blend of tropical fruit, peach, pear and apple flavors. But the wine is overoaked, with 75% new wood in the barrel fermentation.

This refined wine exudes finesse and refinement.",Estate Bottled,91,40.0,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Chalk Hill
62761,US,"A winning wine that displays a vibrantly fragrant tangerine, citrus and herb-butter bouquet. It opens to a full, dense tropical-fruit palate and shows an almost seamless texture. Tangy oak plays off the lingering fruit nuances on this bottling's lengthy, luxurious finish.",Signature,91,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Chappellet
62762,US,"One of a back-to-back pair of strong performances from Foley, this wine opens with well-defined herb, caramel and cream nose. Ripe apple and toasted oak flavors round out the rich, buttery palate. The citrus and peach finish goes on forever. Shows complexity, but with a straight-ahead style that make it a real pleaser. Great now.",Barrel Select,91,38.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Foley
62763,US,"Bob Lindquist's 1999 offering displays a lovely opening of tropical fruit and vanilla custard beneath a smoky veil. The palate's understated nectarine, pear, pineapple flavors are bolstered by firm but not sharp acidity. The mouthfeel is crisp; the wine's fine structure shows through the tangy, nut-pepper finish. Already impressive, but warrants cellaring for two or three years. Top Value.",Bien Nacido Reserve,91,30.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Qupé
62764,US,"An intoxicating bouquet of clove, ripe orange, peach and melon promises a lot, but this wine delivers. The similarly heady palate of creamy, ripe tropical fruit is almost romantic, the richly textured mouthfeel full and lush. Finishes long in the same sensuous manner. Drink now for its exuberant fruit and voluptuous feel. Like Paul, his wines exude style and character.",,91,38.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Paul Hobbs
62765,US,"The ripe bouquet shows rich banana, butter and pineapple aromas. Full-bodied, yet bright with lively acidity, the palate displays bright citrus, butterscotch, pineapple, green plum and vanilla flavors. There's slight heat, but also nice vanilla and citrus notes on the long finish.",Nielson Historic Vines,91,75.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Byron
62766,US,"A seductive nose of pineapple, pear, vanilla and buttered toast leads, followed by a nicely knit, well-fruited, but not-at-all sweet palate. Here, pear, melon, pineapple and tangerine is offset by light toast and vanilla accents. Balanced and smoothly textured, it shows graceful restraint that suggests it will improve over the next year or two.",,91,32.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Cakebread
62767,US,"This is a full, round and juicy wine, with pronounced orange, tangerine and pineapple aromas and flavors. Wonderful hints of vanilla and spice accent the bright tangy core of citrus fruit. A wine that's big and packed with fine ripe fruit, but isn't over the top.",Bien Nacido Vineyard,91,35.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Foley
62768,US,"Bright pear, peach, pineapple, ginger snap and floral notes grace a fresh, fragrant nose. The palate's exotic tropical fruit, ginger and lychee nut flavors mingle beautifully in a medium-full, though perhaps slightly sweet, package. Elegant and appealingly fresh.",Great Estates,91,35.0,California,Arroyo Seco,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Kendall-Jackson
62769,US,"A very ripe tropical-fruit nose is complemented beautifully by an intense smoky-toasty element. Pineapple, mango and caramel flavors stand out on the full palate: The smoky note resurfaces later, riding out the persistent finish. This is a sleek, stylish, but very solidly built Chardonnay. It pushes all the right sensory buttons, with big body and great lines, like a '56 Buick.","Reserve Unfined, Unfiltered",91,58.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Jarvis
62770,US,"Joseph Phelps's flagship Chardonnay is a study in sophisticated style. A fragrant peach, pineapple, smoke and floral bouquet might, in other wines, be overpowering, but here it is subtly seductive. Rich peach, tart orange and oat flavors ride the velvety palate, and the long, suave finish displays tangerine, peaches and cream aromas and flavors. There are layers of nuance to explore here—savor this one slowly.",Ovation,91,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Joseph Phelps
62771,US,"From the orange, creamy buttermilk and earthy notes on the nose to the dry mineral, herb and Asian pear palate, there's much to savor here—such as the balance, proportion and long, citrus-mineral finish. This is a complex and reserved wine, not a conventional, in-your-face bottling. It's rather tight now, but if you give it two years (or more!), you'll be well rewarded.",Diamond T Estate,91,55.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Talbott
62772,US,"The third vintage of the Beringer senior winemaker's namesake bottling is robust, yet approachable. This wine is lavishly—to some, overly oaked, but it's one of the best of this style. Apple, cinnamon bun, and smoke aromas give way to caramel, vanilla and spice flavors. Add a rich, round mouthfeel, and you've got a very seductive package. This wine is more about vigorous style, flavor and texture than subtlety. Only die-hard anti-oaksters will be able to resist its appeal.",Sbragia-Limited Release,91,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Beringer
62773,US,"Another elegant wine from Cambria. This one has a vanilla, smoke and grapefruit nose. Medium-weight, it is crisp in the mouth, though somewhat leaner than the Bench Break. This cuvée nicely melds green apple fruit with menthol and vanilla accents. The bouquet is a reprise of the long, sweet-tart, butterscotch and tangy oak finish.",Rae's,91,41.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Cambria
62774,US,"Crème brûlée creaminess combines with tart citrus fruitiness in this wine, which displays great balance and richness. A nice oak frame holds it all together and provides a handsome framework for the lime-orange-tangerine citrus core. The palate has buttery caramel and wintergreen accents. Long, serene finish.",Reserve,91,45.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Chateau St. Jean
62775,US,"Full and fat with a delightful mix of tropical fruit and new oak spiciness. Both a creamy texture and good acid—a feat in itself—offset nicely the rich pineapple, peach, coconut, clove and exotic spice flavors. Has style, balance and length. Drink this Carneros champ now and over the next two years. Top Value.",,91,30.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Truchard
62776,US,"Best known for their classic Cabernets, this producer has a confident and skilled hand with Chardonnay, too. This is a well-proportioned wine that displays complex apple, lime, vanilla and earthy mineral notes. There's a crisp tautness to the apple fruit and tart citrus acidity that carries on the long, spicy finish. A powerhouse that promises to open up over the next year. Top Value.",,91,30.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars
62777,US,"Taste this wine and you'll agree: It's big. Even fat. A fragrant, buttery apple-floral bouquet opens into a banana, orange and hay palate. The mouthfeel is creamy, round and lively—it's full-flavored without being too weighty. Pear and butterscotch linger on the finish.",Stature,90,60.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Kendall-Jackson
62778,US,"Aromas of smoke, cream and herbs atop a ripe pineapple foundation. In the mouth, pineapple prevails again along with apple, toast and butterscotch notes. It's supple, and though quite fruit-driven, it's not at all sweet. The wine shows complexity and finishes long and light on its feet. Top Value.",KRV Block #13,90,30.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Kirkland Ranch
62779,US,"Aromas of butter, cream and popcorn are so prevalent on the nose that you'll swear you're at the movies. Popcorn and butter show again on the palate, but here they're teamed up with ripe golden-apple and orange notes. Finishes with pineapple and butter in bold and appealing style. A daring, not gently nuanced, wine.",DeRose Vineyard,90,34.0,California,Cienega Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Thunder Mountain
62780,US,"This plush Chardonnay's bouquet shows an ultraripe botrytis note in its vanilla, peach, clove and caramel aromas. Dried fruits, caramel and honey flavors massage the palate: the mouthfeel is full and viscous—even voluptuous. A must for lovers of larger-than-life Chards.",,90,40.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Mer Soleil
62781,US,"A tart pineapple-lemon nose with caramel and smoke accents ushers in a full palate. Apple and pear flavors add body, and a chalky note contributes complexity and texture to the palate. Slight creaminess provides a fat, full feel, but maybe just a bit more softness than some tasters preferred. Still, this is a solid wine with finesse and body. It displays both smoky toast and bright orange-lemon notes on the finish.",Mon Plaisir,90,60.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peter Michael Winery
62782,US,"The graceful, subtle nose of pears, apples and hazelnuts don't prepare you for the richness of this old-guard Napa producer's 1999 offering. A full and intense palate of toast, honey, spice and pineapple comes on strong. The flavors are supported by bright acidity, and they linger on the long and lively finish.",,90,40.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Chardonnay,El Molino
62783,US,"Butter and vanilla wrap around tropical fruit and citrus flavors on the full nose. Baked apples, crème caramel and abundant new oak merge to provide this chard with a slightly viscous, buttery texture. Its rich butter and oak may be a bit too much for some. The tangy finish is long and tasty.",Reserve,90,59.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Harrison
62784,US,"This appealing Chardonnay is the same wine that carried a reserve designation in prior vintages. It's lushly woven and has aromas and flavors of pear, pineapple and peach. The fruit is rich but not overly sweet, and sports accents of cinnamon and allspice. This balanced, medium-weight wine finishes long and easy with a nice nuttiness. Top Value.",,90,30.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,La Crema
62785,France,"Aromas of clove, strong, spicy oak and sublimated cherry open this hard-to-decipher wine. Large-scaled, with a full mouthfeel, there's no nuance to read, but we caught a faint glimpse of fruit up front and sensed lovely mineral elements below the surface later. Tight now, but time will tell.",,90,65.0,Burgundy,Clos de Vougeot,,Pinot Noir,Prosper Maufoux
62786,US,"A jazzy bouquet of sour pear, toasted nut and leesy notes opens this North Coast winner. An unusual mix of dry orange, papaya and cantaloupe flavors follow on the palate. The medium-full mouthfeel is butter-smooth, yet bright and crisp enough to not be mushy. Spice and lemon accents enliven the long, tangy finish. Top Value.",Du Pratt Vineyard,90,30.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Chardonnay,Steele
62787,US,"This Napa Valley aristocrat sheds its normally understated demeanor and shows lively, pear, apple and melon fruit plus a vanilla-custard richness. There's toasty oak and a lively acid backbone that will help it evolve over the next few years. It's well-balanced, with a toasty, poised finish that's long and has bright lime overtones.",Estate Bottled,90,52.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Far Niente
62788,US,"In this fine offering from one of this tasting's most consistent performers, a nutty, pineapple-ginger nose opens to a lively mouth of citrus, hazelnut and spice. The feel is firm, elegant.

62789,France,"This shows class and style immediately in its dry black cherry and soft leather aromas with chalk nuances on the nose.

62790,US,"A mix of Walla Walla and Yakima grapes yields a rather austere wine with nuances of mineral, gravel, water over stone.

62792,US,"In the nose are whiffs of rubber ball and burnt match, along with a lightly herbal fruit character reminiscent of the sort of grassiness you find in old-vine Zinfandels.

62793,US,"A classic white Meritage blend—two-thirds Sauvignon Blanc, one third Sémillon, aged sur lie in French oak. Fruity, lively and fresh, with lime, citrus, apple and spicy pear.

62795,US,"Spicy, slightly volatile, with smooth plum and chocolate flavors across the palate. There's some lift from the VA, and then the silky tannins carry it along for a very pleasant ride. It just lacks the extra bit of depth that would ramp it up to the next decile.",Stillwater Creek Vineyard,89,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Saviah
62796,US,"A Bordeaux blend, smooth and ultrachocolaty in the house style. The cherry fruit is coated in flavors of hazelnut, cocoa, espresso and chocolate.

62797,US,"Spicy and bright, this could almost be Grenache, with its penetrating acid and the lightness to its fruit.

62803,Hungary,"One of the grapes used in the famous dessert wine, this dry-style from the village of Tokaj has a mixture of fresh, vibrant fruit with a supple, round body.

62847,US,"This Chardonnay and Riesling blend tastes TBA—totally botrytis affected—which it was, resulting in an intensely concentrated sweet wine.

62854,Italy,"Sprightly and youthful, this ruby-colored blend of Sangiovese (60%) and Montepulciano offers immediate aromas of raspberry and wild strawberry backed by white almond and moist tobacco.

62879,Chile,"Fairly straightforward and solid Merlot from Chile. The nose is sort of brambly, but there's reasonably fresh plum and berry aromas.

62940,Spain,"A sweet, raisiny old-vines Garnacha with candied aromas and a fat, chunky body that houses soft, short black fruit and peppery flavors. Tastes like licorice candy on the finish, which brings some heat and burn as well.

62941,US,"This red blend is 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 3% Syrah—peppery, tannic, and fruity. A jam and toast style, it shows some heat in the finish.",Fusion Red,87,28.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Walla Faces
62942,US,"Offers hints of the winery's great vineyard-designates, but seems overpriced for what you get.

62953,Argentina,"Aromas of mocha, rubber, smoky leather and berry fruit indicate good things to come, but in the mouth this wine fails to deliver equal to its price and the previous successes of Trapiche's single-vineyard Malbec project. Scouring acidity is the main culprit; the wine seems clipped, tartaric and angular, thus it's all superficial and not deep or rich enough to rate better.",Viña Domingo F.

62956,Spain,"Rusty in color, with initial aromas of smoke, dried leaves, herbs, tobacco and subtle berry.

Toasty and solid on the finish.",Kickass,86,13.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Garnacha,El Burro
62961,US,"Very ripe, to the point of overripe. The blackberries and black currants veer into raisins, and there's a hint of raisinskin tartness that, combined with the strong tannins, adds to the tough mouthfeel.

62962,US,"With no oak, this wine's inherent fruit stars, showing citrus, melons and peaches. With crisp acidity, it's clean, brisk and entirely dry, despite relatively low alcohol.

62963,Argentina,"Initially it gives off murky, soupy aromas. But with airing it rounds into form, displaying prune and oak scents in front of a round, soft, stewy palate of chunky berry flavors.

63018,US,"Dark, smoky and chewy, this young, tannic effort could stand in for any good Walla Walla Syrah from a dozen different producers. It is a testament to the quality of Washington Syrah; but also an example of the sameness that plagues many of them. There is a nice core of juicy boysenberry, and beyond that it's all about roasted coffee, bitter chocolate and toast.",,88,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Tamarack Cellars
63019,Portugal,"With its charming aromas of spice drop, ripe cherries and schistous minerality, this Taylor looks set to zoom. And it is tasty, but also a bit soft and lacking structure—something unexpected from a Port under the Taylor label. Turns chocolaty on the finish. Drink now. Imported by Kobrand.",LBV,88,25.0,Port,,,Port,Taylor Fladgate
63020,Argentina,"Broquel is Trapiche's higher-end label, and generally speaking this Chardonnay is one of the best Argentineans going. Yes, there's a heavy dose of wood, but with time it meshes nicely into the apple, melon and citrus fruit that's prominently on display. Pure on the finish, with forward acidity. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Broquel,88,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Trapiche
63021,US,"Borderline funky with somewhat quirky, but interesting scents of tea, cola, licorice, plums, vanilla and spice.

63022,US,"Puget Sound is the smallest and least-well-known appellation in Washington State, but among the dozen or so wineries that actually grow grapes here, Whidbey is the standout. Their Siegerrebe (a relative of Gewürztraminer) is an off-dry white wine, rich with citrus, spice, honey, pear, apricot and pine tar. The overriding impression is one of fresh-squeezed grapefruit, and the alcohol is just 11.5%.",,88,12.0,Washington,Puget Sound,Washington Other,Siegerrebe,Whidbey Island Winery

The finish carries the slightest suggestion of oak.",RTW,88,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Cayalla
63030,US,"An extraordinary Syrah, from Ciel du Cheval grapes.

63031,US,"Firm in acids, with some tannins, yet not at all hard. This is a magnificent, masculine Pinot Noir. It floods the palate with cherry pie, cola and mocha flavors, Asian spices and a sweet, smoky, buttery phyllo pastry quality. So technically perfect, with such structure, it seems guaranteed for the cellar. Drink now through 2010, but who knows how long it will last.",Fe Ciega Vineyard,95,43.0,California,Sta.

63032,Italy,"This wine towers over others in terms of excellence. This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 10% Syrah and other varieties (that sees 14 months of barrique) is the epitome of grace and elevates wine drinking to almost spiritual heights: The nose is horizontal, wide, vast and infinite with extraordinary tobacco, leather with fine cherry at its core and toasted almond and herbal notes at the extremities.

63035,France,"At five years of age, this is still a young wine, keeping much of its appeal firmly under wraps. The tight aromas and flavors only gradually reveal hints of their future grandeur in tantalizing glimpses of honey, anise, orange peel and pineapple. Yet the neverending length and pronounced minerality to this wine's finish leaves no doubt of its ultimate quality. Try after 2010?",Le Méal,94,134.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Marsanne,M. Chapoutier
63036,US,"A step beyond the immense 2003, this actually supercedes the sheer massive power of that wine with a sleeker, more elegant structure. Classy, bright, lifted scents lead into a peppery, red-fruited Syrah annotated with citrus oil. Tart, young, clean and delineated, it is Matt Loso's immaculate, concise winemaking at its best.

63037,US,"Winemaker Eric Dunham was the first to latch onto the fruit coming from this exceptional site in the Rattlesnake Hills, and this is as good as any Syrah made in Washington. An awesome nose with spectacular intensity spills out of the glass, carrying superb raspberry scents. The wine is crisp and focused, intense and nuanced.

63038,US,"As with the Ciel bottling, this is pure Syrah from a single vineyard.

63045,France,"A blend of one-third each Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah, year-in and year-out this is among Lirac's top wines, if not the top. In 2003, it's rich, ripe and a touch alcoholic, but still boasts well-defined aromas of plum and spice. In the mouth, it's like liquid chocolate fudge--velvety, yet never ponderous or heavy.

63046,France,"A bit closed on the nose, but the potential of this wine is obvious.

63047,US,"Pure Syrah from a great lineup of vineyards. In this freeze year the Walla Walla vineyard produced no fruit, so winemaker Trey Busch sourced his grapes from an all-star lineup including Lewis, Minick, Portteus and Columbia Crest. Densely packed with mixed purple fruits, it also sports a mix of wet leaf, earth and herb flavors that add texture and beaucoup aroma. This leans towards the funky side, in a style more reminiscent of France than Australia, but what amazing flavors.",,93,42.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Basel Cellars
63048,US,"A blend of two great vineyards, Shadow Canyon and Laetitia, this wine is notable for its delicacy and charm. But that doesn't mean it's wimpy.

This limited (75 case) Bordeaux blend is wonderfully concentrated with sweet, stiff, sappy fruit, Juicy in the mouth, but tightly wound, it is fleshed out with buttery oak flavors of vanilla, toast and caramel.

The body is full but not what you'd call flabby; there's adequate acidity to cut the chunkiness.

63101,France,"A Merlot-dominated wine (with 30% Cabernet Sauvignon), this is the simpler of two reds produced by the dynamic Bantegnies family.

63106,Spain,"Spicy and inviting on the nose, with no shortage of oak. The palate holds that spiciness as bramble and some tartness enter the fray.

63107,Spain,"The color and mouthfeel on this modern-styled, expensive Rioja are both very nice. On the palate, it's cushioned and healthy, with smooth tannins and proper acidity.

63111,New Zealand,"A blend of 61% Merlot and 37% Cabernet Sauvignon, this medium-bodied red comes across as a bit firm and earthy.

63183,US,"For decades Hanzell has been making one of California's most (and only) ageworthy Chards. The '03 is one for the cellar, but it comes at the price of being hard in youth. Starts out flinty and tannic, although as it airs, new oak and pineapple emerge. This seems like a very good Hanzell. Best 2009–2015.",,92,65.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hanzell
63184,France,"A blend of 90% Grenache and 10% Syrah, all from vines averaging 80 years of age, this is a stupendously concentrated wine that still possesses nuance and complexity. Exotic spices—notably lavender and clove—scent the bouquet, while the huge palate boasts layers of plum fruit and thick, velvety tannins. Drinkable now, but probably at its best after 2012.",Valbelle,92,40.0,Rhône Valley,Gigondas,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Château de Saint-Cosme

63186,US,"I haven't cared for this winery's Bordeaux wines, but with the Burgundians they're hitting pay dirt. This Dijon-clone Pinot is an excellent dry, silky wine with complex flavors of cherries, black raspberries, cola, licorice candy and cinnamon spice. Unfiltered and well oaked, the wine offers something new and interesting with every sniff and sip.",Dunah Vineyard,92,42.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Peters Family
63187,US,"The vineyard is 1,800 feet up the mountain and the wine was made by Randy Dunn's (Dunn Vineyards) son, Mike. Howell Mountain produces some of California's densest, most ageworthy red wines, and this big, dry, tannic Pet is a sure cellar candidate. Packed with blackberry, coffee, plum, leather and spice flavors, it should start to open up by 2009 and improve for several years after.",,92,40.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Petite Sirah,Retro
63188,Italy,"Although it is too young to drink now, the second edition of Drómos (an intricate blend of five red varieties) already boasts beautiful development with notes of blackberry, cherry fruit, smoke, granite, clove, spice with oak balance. It's smooth, creamy and mouth-wateringly succulent in the mouth.",Dròmos,92,60.0,Tuscany,Maremma,,Red Blend,Poggio Verrano
63189,US,"Colgin's first Syrah, and the first from winemaker Mark Aubert, the wine is very dark and glyceriney, suggesting massive extract. Opens with an exciting blast of white pepper leading to baked cherry pie, leather, truffle and complex earthy scents. In the mouth, it's very fruity and chocolaty, with tons of toasty new oak. Yet there is something dramatic here. This is a Syrah to carefully watch in future vintages.",IX Estate,92,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,Colgin
63190,France,"Dense and richly fruited on the nose, but not jammy or simple—there's a healthy dose of spice to add nuance to the plum and black-cherry flavors.

63192,France,"Seemingly at its peak of maturity, although it should stay there for several years, this is a masterful Saint-Joseph, showing great complexity (flowers, pepper, smoke, cherries), ripe fruit and satin-textured tannins. Drink now-2012.",Les Granits,92,95.0,Rhône Valley,Saint-Joseph,,Syrah,M. Chapoutier
63193,Australia,"This second vintage of Barry's Florita Riesling is excellent. Its flour-like, dusty mouthfeel follows light floral, minerally aromatics. On the palate it's blissfully dry, with lively acidity and dusty citrus flavors. Finish is persistent; delicious throughout.",The Florita,92,30.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Riesling,Jim Barry

63195,US,"Dennis Fife brings his talent for rich, gutsy reds to this Cab, a blend of Atlas Peak and St. Helena fruit. It's a big, powerful wine, but elegant and controlled every step of the way.

Drink this racy wine now.",Solomon Hills Vineyards,92,38.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,J. Wilkes
63197,France,"Even though this tips the scales at close to 16% alcohol, there's no trace of heat, just an incredible lush, creamy texture and layers of rich raspberry and blackberry fruit. Hints of coffee and cocoa from two years aging in oak impart nuance, but the old-vine fruit comfortably carries the day.

63199,France,"Escaravailles makes two sweet wines, this one from Grenache Noir, as well as a white from Grenache Blanc. While both are impressive, the red is a touch more impressive.

63202,Australia,"From the folks who bring you Two Hands comes this big Cab, which sticks to the glass and deals a chile-spiced nose right out of the gate. The front palate is loaded with chocolate, mocha and forward fruit—all of the hedonistic sexiness your palate can handle. A hint of sour cherry is buried, suggesting that some of its assets may reveal themselves down the track.",Greenock Coach House Block,91,105.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Branson Coach House
63203,US,"Soft and fragrant, smooth and showing a pleasing mix of citrus, berry and plum, this wine has no rough edges.

63206,US,"Fruit from both Boushey and Ciel du Cheval goes into this special reserve. Always a blockbuster, it is perhaps a touch too ripe in this warm vintage. Dark, jammy, minced pie/fruit compote flavors mix with baked apple, cherry and plum. There are tasty baking spice flavors also, and the wine is ready to be consumed now. The blend includes 12% Mourvèdre and a touch of Viognier.",Cuvée Orleans,91,60.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,McCrea
63207,US,"This brilliant PG has just a bit of older French oak on it, which adds softening cream, but the wine would be great even without it. The flavors of citrus zest, grapefruit sorbet, melons and figs are enormously rich and strong, and perfectly balanced by crisp acidity and a vibrant minerality leading to a dry, clean finish. What a great price for a wine of this stature.",R&D; Franscioni Vineyard,91,16.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Gris,Morgan
63208,Italy,"This is a 40-30-30% blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot that is rich in floral and herbal notes. Rosemary, sage, violets, figs, plum and licorice aromas are harmonious and well-integrated thanks to 14 months of oak aging. Allow the wine a few minutes to open in the glass.",Tassinaia,91,43.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Castello del Terriccio
63209,US,"Paraiso's West Terrace Pinot is one of the secrets of the appellation.

63213,France,"Superripe pear aromas are followed by fruit that hints at oxidation, very open and soft with an intriguing saltiness. Only towards the end does the wine show structure, with pineapple and peach flavors. The fruit is intense, but in the end, the wine seems to fall apart.",La Varenne du Poirier,84,23.0,Loire Valley,Anjou,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine des Grandes Vignes
63214,Chile,"Opens with fiery cherry-berry aromas and then some mossy dankness. The palate is tight and snappy, with basic berry flavors and then a blast of burnt toast and herbal notes.

63218,Chile,"Full and fiery smelling, with black cherry, cola and oaky aromas of butter and cream. The flavors are a touch herbal and creamy, while the fruit leans toward berry and fat plum. With airing it settles into a simple, reasonably good Merlot.",Private Reserve,84,17.0,Maule Valley,,,Merlot,Terravid

63220,Chile,"A little gritty and meaty on the nose, with vegetal notes of celery and beans sneaking onto the bouquet. The flavors are fairly generic for New World red wine, so expect plum and berry flavors with some herbal accents and a touch of core bitterness. Reflective of the variety on one hand but generic on the other.",Reserva,84,13.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Carmenère,Ventisquero
63221,Chile,"A bit sweet, confected and fluffy on the nose, especially for Syrah. And it's definitely on the heavy side as the flavors lean toward raisin and prune and stewed plum. Finishing notes of chocolate and toast come straight from the barrel, and with such a heavy outlook it's doubtful this one will age for long.",Colchagua-Apalta Single Vineyard,84,18.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Syrah,Veranda
63222,Chile,"Not what you'd call overtly fruity with its charred, reduced set of grilled meat and leathery aromas.

Not bad but sort of rubbery and baked in the end.",Puerto Viejo Reserve,84,10.0,Curicó Valley,,,Syrah,Viña Requingua

63226,Chile,"Big but clumsy, with unrefined aromas of berry fruit and herbs. The palate is grabbby and sassy, but it's also generous with the sappy black plum, berry and herbal flavors. A combination of menthol and molasses works the weighty finish, and overall this seems like a goofy, awkward school kid.",Reserva,84,16.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec,Nuevomundo

63230,South Africa,"A nose of peppery, spiced meat and smoke leads into this savory, spicy red. A full, appealing mouthfeel gives the wine character, but the flavors are a touch rustic. Needs more balance and finesse, but overall, a good everyday sip.",Starlette Rouge,84,13.0,Western Cape,,,Red Blend,Allée Bleue
63231,US,"This Syrah, as in 2006, is the best of the Airfield reds, opening with varietal scents and showing some gamy, herbal, minty notes. Too much vanilla from the barrel aging takes over the finish, and the fruit does not have the concentration to stand up to it.",,84,24.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Airfield Estates
63232,New Zealand,"Almost pale coppery in color, Isabel's 2007 Pinot Gris is made in an off-dry style that's presumably meant to buffer the wine's crisp acids and cool, minerally personality. Instead, the honeyed notes clash somewhat with the hardness of the finish.",,84,22.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Gris,Isabel Estate
63233,Chile,"Plenty of oak off the bat, which is what deviates this wine from the brand's standard $8 Cab. Frankly, we prefer the cheaper one; this is lemony and overcrowded with coffee and mocha characteristics. The flavors of cherry and wild raspberry are decent, but the balance is sketchy and the oak and acidity seem elevated for what it is.",Reserva,84,11.0,Maule Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sundance
63234,US,"This simple Merlot offers plenty of semi-sweet chocolate, raspberry, red currant and sandalwood flavors. What it's lacking is structure. Tasty, but needs greater acidity and tannins for balance.",,84,24.0,California,Napa-Sonoma,North Coast,Merlot,Artesa

63239,France,"Red Menetou-Salon, based on Pinot Noir, is a curiosity, particularly in cool years. This wine is typical—quite lean and austere, with light fruit flavors, but dominated by acidity. To be drunk soon.",,84,21.0,Loire Valley,Menetou-Salon,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Alain Assadet

63256,US,"A very nice effort at this price, it's smooth and supple, with surprising chocolaty notes (surprising because the winemaker insists that no new oak was used).

63269,Italy,"A Prosecco with personality and unique strong points: There's a toasty, bread-like element to the nose with generous peach, apricot, almond and crushed stone. Has a thicker, creamier consistency with lingering freshness on the medium finish. Imported by Panebianco.",Brut,88,15.0,Veneto,Prosecco di Valdobbiadene,,Prosecco,Drusian
63270,France,"A simple wine that tastes of black currants, plum stones and throws in very dry tannins. The wood element shows with the smoky, meaty character, but mainly this is about fruit and acidity.",,86,13.0,Bordeaux,Côtes de Bourg,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château de Bousquet
63271,France,"There's plenty of classic Bordeaux black currant here, freshening up this fruity, fragrantly fresh wine. The tannins are a whisper under all this great fruit.",,86,11.0,Bordeaux,Premieres Côtes de Bordeaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château La Grange Clinet
63272,Italy,"This wine has a slightly aged appearance thanks to its garnet color and its aromas of ripe cherry, prunes, toast, tobacco and black stone. It boasts nice dimension and a smooth structure.",,86,,Tuscany,Chianti,,Sangiovese,Casale del Duccio

63277,New Zealand,"This widely available brand continues to turn out reliable bottlings vintage after vintage. The 2006 Sauvignon Blanc features restrained gooseberry and peach aromatics, then turns up the stone-fruit volume on the palate and adds some slightly pithy citrus notes.",,86,17.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Grove Mill
63278,US,"Marked by acidity, which gives a tart, hard edge to the fruit, this Zin may benefit from some time in the cellar.

63279,Spain,"Melon, honey and white stone-fruit aromas carry the nose, with a touch of sulfuric match stick sneaking in late.

63280,US,"I haven't tasted many Pinot Noirs from the Sierra Foothills, but this wine shows some promise. The main drawback is excessive softness, which makes it flabby.

63330,US,"A chewy wine with tremendous extraction and flavor intensity, this has some Port-like qualities, and the flavors are tart-sweet, pruney, with nutty, almost bitter almond notes peeking through.

63331,US,"Attractive pear, citrus, melon and mild spice aromas open this lean and elegant wine. The mouthfeel is light, but not insubstantial and slightly tense (in a good way), showing good acid spine, crisp citrus flavors and taut mineral accents. A slight creaminess keeps it from getting too sharp, and it closes with a nice chalky note.

63332,US,"Susie Selby's homage to her late father has some sulfur and earthy notes on the nose, but there's good fruit behind.

Finishes soft, with a faint whiff of petrol—in the Alsace manner—and is drinking well now.",David Selby Reserve,88,38.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Selby
63333,US,"Aromas of movie popcorn, hops and Asian pear open this rather over-the-top wine. It's a decidedly candy-sweet combination of butterscotch, peach and nut flavors with a soft, round mouthfeel. The light orange finish is easy.

63334,US,"Citrus, pineapple, white stone fruits and green apple are among the aromas and flavors in this clean, medium-weight offering.

63335,US,"Smoky, heavy toasted oak complements mild tropical fruit, nuts and coconut on the nose.

Finishes dry, brisk and slightly tart.",MacGregor Vineyard,88,30.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Cathy MacGregor
63336,France,"A nose of tart strawberry scents, spice and just a slight stemmy note opens this decent value in Pinot Noir. No, it's not the most sophisticated red Burgundy out there, but it shows where it's from. It also shows some complexity, good acids and brisk tannins. Try it with stew or grilled tuna steaks.

63338,US,"The historic estate's 1998 is characteristically lean, angular and fairly closed. The bouquet of apple cider, anise, and fragrant jasmine-like notes opens to a trim palate of green apple and toast flavors, and a taut mouthfeel.

Notoriously tight when young, this wine often opens incredibly with cellaring.",,87,30.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Chateau Montelena
63339,US,"Tasters pegged apples, anise, crème brûlée and cinnamon in the lively nose of this rich wine—one that also sparked some controversy. The straight-ahead flavor profile is appealing, with solid apple, clove and butterscotch offset by the attractive anise streak. But is it native yeast or heavy malolactic fermentation that's responsible for the mixed feelings some panelists expressed? Concerns were noted about a dairy-like note on the nose and also a slick, yet gummy texture. Nevertheless, the winning aromas and flavors kept the overall take positive.",VGS,87,45.0,California,Mount Veeder,Napa,Chardonnay,Château Potelle
63340,Australia,"This pleasant, medium-weight white from an Iberian grape shows why it has caught on among our adventurous Aussie cousins.

63343,US,"We enjoyed the vanilla, pear, butter and toasty flavors on this classy Chard, but the high alcohol it contains almost does it in. The nice acid backbone holds it together though and leaves a good overall impression. Enjoy it with grilled seafood.",Reserve,87,35.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Saintsbury
63344,US,"Lavishly oaked from the first whiff on the nose and palate, dense toasty notes envelope the pineapple and tropical fruit. Plenty of vanilla and both a tangy nuttiness and a creaminess from the oak, provide a nice mouthfeel tension. Panelists had two schools of thought about this wine: The oak totally dominates—certainly now—and how you feel about that determines your take on the wine. Lacking fruit? Or just tight and needing a year or two to open? Only time will tell.",Reserve,87,58.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Jarvis
63345,US,"This sunny, medium-gold wine opens with caramel and apple aromas.

63347,US,"Pear, pineapple and herb aromas intrigued some tasters, but others found an odd note in this wine's nose. Vanilla, pear, apple and sweet spices mark the medium-weight and round palate. The back end of this wine has tangy wood and a slight chalkiness.",Reserve,87,30.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Beaulieu Vineyard
63348,US,"This Chard displays a slightly unusual but appealing sweet and sour streak. The bouquet shows tart green apples, grapefruit, stewed fruit and sweet herbs, plus tangy green oak shadings. The palate delivers more of the same, with zingy citrus and crisp apple flavors, but also dry, leesy notes. There's both cream and pepper on the back end of this likeable, split-personality wine.",Sangiacomo Vineyards Reserve,87,30.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Bernardus
63349,US,"The bouquet of Farrell's wine is a mixed bag of buttered popcorn, minerals, herbs, citrus fruit, pineapple and melon stuffed in an oak envelope. Similarly attractive flavors mark the palate, which is fairly full and has an almost rustic quality.

63350,France,"Solid and lean, this wine shows a bouquet of dried fruits and leaves, dark berries and leather.

63352,US,"A full and creamy bouquet announces a palate laden with ripe golden delicious apple, vanilla, and melon flavors, with chalk, mineral and earth elements.

63353,US,"This Napa Valley mainstay's offering shows a firm acid backbone and crisp, bright green apple flavors with lemony accents.

63354,US,"The full fresh-bread aromas of yeast, honey, oats promise much body, but the palate delivers a dry citrus-mineral mouthful of flavors.

63357,US,"This very rare, single-vineyard Chardonnay has distinct vanilla, golden delicious apple, banana and peach flavors—a nice mix of sweet and sour, but some tasters found searing acidity and a sharp metallic note. Finishes tart, dry and long with a bracing edge capable of cutting right through your fried calamari and spicy sauce. Only 132 cases produced.",Dierberg Vineyard,87,35.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Foley
63358,US,"A big nose of toasty oak, vanilla and butterscotch opens this offering. There are hints of pear and apple fruit, but the palate has a dominating oakiness and a custardy fatness. It's slightly hot, with dominant butterscotch and vanillin oaky flavors.",Upper Barn,87,40.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Stonestreet
63359,US,"Respected vineyard source and established record of the winemaker notwithstanding, the dense gunpowder/matchstick quality here isn't easy to take—or even read.

63361,Italy,"Here's a fresh and easy blend of Trebbiano, Chardonnay and Sauvignon (at an attractive low price) that offers clean, but not very intense, aromas of cut grass, field flowers and lemon. The wine renders a sweet, chewy sensation in the mouth with soft texture and a creamy finish.",Moma,84,11.0,Central Italy,Rubicone,,White Blend,Umberto Cesari
63362,Chile,"Fairly gritty and reduced at first, with aromas of grilled beef, leather and herbs. After some airing it rounds out to show flavors of raspberry and sweet red fruits, while the feel is chewy, full and candied. Never really gets it going but not bad for a basic Chilean red blend.",Chamán Reserva,84,14.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,Viña Santacruz
63363,Chile,"Odfjell's new entry into the under-$10 category is Babor, and the wine has aromas of raspberry jam and a touch of bramble and vinegar.

Classic value wine in the sense that it delivers up to a point.",Babor,84,9.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Odfjell
63364,Chile,"Fairly warm and syrupy on the nose, with bits of earth, leather and baked plum. The palate is a touch underdeveloped and herbal in terms of flavor, but there's no shortage of size.

63367,Chile,"Falernia hails from the northerly Elqui Valley, and its wines are unconventional and frankly all over the map as far as baseline quality goes. This blend of Carmenère and Syrah is funky and baked, with soft, unctuous fruit and a cooked, herbal taste to it. Candy and raisin are part of the jumbled package, and there's heat on the finish.

63375,Chile,"Simple and sort of plastic in smell, taste and feel. Bubble gum and apple skin flavors infiltrate the palate, and the mouthfeel and finish are creamy, dry and seem to be flattening out.

63382,Chile,"Not many modern-day Carmenères are as overtly green and underdone as this, which is surprising given that it's from warm Colchagua and a good vintage.

63397,US,"Here is a ripe, full-flavored Cabernet that clocks in at a moderate 12.5% alcohol. The blend includes 10% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Franc. Surely a great strength of  cool-climate, Yakima Valley Cabernet is its ability to obtain ripe, naturally tart, mixed fruit flavors, and avoid joining the syrupy, jammy, hedonistic crowd.

63431,France,"From a producer better known for Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this has a beautiful bouquet of crushed spices, violets, and black cherries followed by lush, deep flavors of plums, black cherries and peppery spice.

The husband and wife team, with no prior winemaking experience, admit that at the beginning, “We made all the mistakes we could.” They've certainly come a long way.

63434,US,"The Magnifique is Dacon's top Syrah, a barrel selection from the French oak-aged side of the winery. It's 98% Syrah, with a splash of Viognier, and indeed it shows a bit more fruit-driven power than the Belle. Blackberry, black cherry and a good lift from streaks of citrus mitigate the overpowering barrel flavors; there's also plenty of fresh acid to provide extra thrust on lift-off.

63441,Chile,"This small-production luxury red blends Carmenère, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, and the end result is excellent. Licorice and black fruit carry the masculine bouquet, and next up is a palate of ripe berries that explode in a fireball of flavor. Not oaky, but well oaked; shows the essence of Maipo fruit.",Sons of the Sun,91,50.0,Maipo Valley,,,Red Blend,Antiyal
63442,US,"Stylish and tight, with compact flavors of cassis, black cherry and berry in a wrap of baby fat. This muscular Cab has the toasty joie de vivre of a new Bordeaux, without all the herbal stuff. New (as of 2003) winemaker Kevin Mott seems to have solved the issues that were creating severely reduced, hard-as-nails wines in recent vintages.",Artist Series #12,91,44.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Woodward Canyon
63443,US,"Actually from Santa Rita Hills, this wine is very young now and needs to be decanted to appreciate its ripe blackberry, cola, spice and oak flavors. The air will soften the somewhat astringent tannins and let the wine's flash shine through.",Ampelos Vineyard,91,42.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,Jaffurs
63444,US,"A very fine cab Franc; smooth, polished and showing its varietal character. The coffee ground flavors, mixed with green tea tannins, give it a defining edge. It's an earthiness that sets it apart from Cabernet Sauvignon. Inside you'll find plenty of plush blueberry and plum fruit. Good winemaking.",,91,25.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Cabernet Franc,Camaraderie Cellars
63445,France,"Although two bottles of this domaine's 2001 were too brett-ridden to recommend, this wine was stellar. It bursts from the glass with peppered strawberries and dried spices, then adds a lush, creamy mouthfeel and supple tannins. Like few wines do, it seems to grow in intensity on the finish. Drink now–2015.",1806,91,,Rhône Valley,Gigondas,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine du Grapillon d'Or
63446,France,"An excellent effort, La Roubine's 2004 Gigondas takes blackberry and pepper notes and combines them in a lovely bouquet that's more than the sum of its parts. There's a lushly textured, creamy mouthfeel that makes for even more hedonistic delight. Like a repeating decimal, it's long on the finish. Drink now–2012, maybe longer.",,91,24.0,Rhône Valley,Gigondas,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine la Roubine
63447,France,"Full-bodied, with a creamy texture and bright raspberry fruit that help to balance out the considerable tannic heft. Long on the finish, where it picks up lovely spice nuances. Drink 2009–2015.",Signature,91,25.0,Rhône Valley,Vacqueyras,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine les Amouriers
63448,US,"Doesn't say so on the label, but the wine comes from Kathy Joseph's Fiddlestix Vineyard, and the wine shows the property's clarity of acidity and wealth of berry and spice flavors. It's very dry, a fun wine yet a serious one too, and certainly among the best California rosés of the vintage.",Pink Fiddle Rosé,91,15.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Fiddlehead
63449,France,"From its lovely bouquet of dried flowers and spices to its voluptuous mouthfeel, this knockout has it all. Perfectly ripe (not overripe) black cherries form the foundation, garnished by complex notes of garrigue, and framed by a firm, ageworthy structure.

63450,US,"An admirable first effort from this winery on the high slopes of Lake County's Mount Konocti, but the winemaker has to figure out a way to rein in those tannins. The underlying wine is potentially great, with Bordeaux-like cassis, cedar, pencil lead and smoky oak flavors balanced by pure, crisp acids, but the tannins are raspingly dry.",One,86,38.0,California,Red Hills Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Cabernet Sauvignon,Snows Lake
63451,US,"Named after the scenic highway that runs along the coastal mountains, this unoaked Chard is bone dry, crisp in acids, and lean. The flavors are of grapefruits and limes. A very elegant wine that appeals for its clean balance and zest.",Skyline,86,16.0,California,California,California Other,Chardonnay,Thomas Fogarty
63452,Italy,This is executed in a traditional style that can be recognized by its light ruby color and vibrant cherry aromas. The pretty nose is well balanced and clean and the wine is lively in the mouth with fresh acidity on the close.,,86,,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Santa Trinita

63454,US,"A little on the soft, one-dimensional side, but very drinkable, with jammy flavors of cherries, blackberries, blueberries and spices, and the leathery, roasted meat taste you sometimes find in Syrah. The gritty tannins will cut through roasts.",,86,29.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Syrah,Hug
63455,US,"The Mariah model of Zin always has been elegant, Bordeaux-style Zins like this. It has the silky body almost of a Pinot Noir, with rich raspberry, cherry, carob and spice flavors, and is soft and dry. There's some notable sweaty funk in the aroma, though, that lowers the score.",,86,24.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Zinfandel,Mariah

63457,US,"Another winery owns the rights to the word Bodacious, so this Bordeaux-Syrah blend adds an “r” to the proprietary name.

63460,France,"A heavily wood-dominated wine, and firmly tannic. The fruit is almost a component of the wood, which needs 2 years to calm down. This shows some freshness and acidity however, and that helps it on its way.",,86,,Bordeaux,Graves,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Perron
63461,France,"A stalky, lean wine with austere fruits. The tannins are dry and washed in acidity. It's firm, structured, hinting at some juicy black currants. There's some spice and smokiness from the wood.",,86,19.0,Bordeaux,Graves,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Ferrande
63462,US,"Soft and a little hot, although the official alcohol is a relatively modest 14.8%. The blackberry, currant, grilled meat and peppery spice flavors are good, but the wine could use extra layers. This is a wine that was a victim of a hard vintage. Drink now.",Shadow Canyon Vineyard,86,40.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Shadow Canyon
63463,US,"The wine is a Bordeaux blend with some Zinfandel, and it's made in the cult Cabernet style. That means it's soft in both tannins and acids, with sweet, oak-influenced flavors of ripe blackberries, cherries, raspberries and cola, and a finish that's almost sweet. However, there's a certain one-dimensionality.",Reserve Red Table Wine,86,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,Simone
63464,US,"This is very, very tannic, making the mouthfeel astringent and sandpapery. That's the wine's only fault, because the Bordeaux-style fruit is gorgeous and so is acidity. Tannin management is the winemaker's challenge.",Two,86,38.0,California,Red Hills Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Snows Lake

63466,US,"With a touch of green bell pepper, this also shows riper citrus, fig and melon flavors that finish in a swirl of tangy spice. No oak, but sur lie aging gives it creamy complexities.",,86,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Work
63467,US,"The problem with Epiphany's Syrahs over the years has been excessively high alcohol, which seems to be a deliberate decision.

63468,US,"Lovers of soft, ripe, jammy Zins will exult in this one, a dry wine with plump flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, carob and rum punch. It shows pretty good concentration for the price.",Tumbling Tractor,85,15.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Gravity Hills
63469,US,"Despite excellent vineyard sources, this is overripe for my palate, with flavors that are pruney and soft, and lacking definition and authority. It's soft and mysteriously weightless, with figgy fruit and a quick finish.",Provence,85,29.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Red Blend,Chateau Faire Le Pont

63476,US,"Soft in acids, with stewed or raisiny cherry and blackberry flavors, this is thick and sticky in tannins. It really needs rich, greasy fare to resolve it. Try with ribs.",Whale Rock,85,30.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Castoro Cellars
63477,Spain,"A heavier, sweeter style with cider-like aromas followed by apple and lime flavors. In the mouth, this is a more citric wine that may go well with shellfish.

63478,US,"This Cab shows an ultrasoft mouthfeel together with fairly aggressive tannins, suggesting an inherent imbalance. The flavors are complex, with herb- and tobacco-tinged blackberry, mocha and cherry fruit mingled with spicy oak. The tight tannins suggest aging, while the absence of acidity mitigates against it. Probably best now.",2480,85,78.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hollywood & Vine

63480,US,"The pleasant nose of nuts, green apples and caramel also shows an odd whiff that mattered more to some tasters than others. Light apple fruit, spice, earth and butterscotch notes play on the full, but vaguely sour milk-tinged palate. Finishes tart and dry with slight mineral notes, in the manner of some white Burgundies. We've been big fans of Foxen's wines in the past, but this one left us scratching our heads.",Tinaquaic Vineyard,86,30.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Foxen
63481,US,"This wine cuts a racy Chablis-like profile. Green apple and lemon-lime fruit, mild spices and a dry earthiness are all in play here. They ride on brisk acidity through a tart and minerally finish. A thoroughbred wine that, to some, “lacks stuffing.”",Huber Vineyard,86,32.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Longoria
63482,France,"Nice tension shows in the floral, peach and stony aromas of this estate wine. It has a lean frame and taut spine, but good fruit, too, with the gentle peachy notes balancing the crisp edge. Closes clean, with citrus and spice. Viré-Clessé is a new appellation replacing the Macon-Villages, -Viré or -Clessé formerly mandated.",Domaine des Combelières,86,14.0,Burgundy,Viré-Clessé,,Chardonnay,Prosper Maufoux
63483,US,"Some panelists praised this Chardonnay's balance and zingy citrus flavors; others were put off by its potent, even overwhelming, oak and green woody aspects. It's full-bodied, and there are pleasant pear, lime and butterscotch notes fighting for space on the palate. Give it a year or two and judge for yourself.",Mt. Carmel Vineyard,86,40.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Au Bon Climat
63484,US,"The nose here shows clean pine and citrus notes, with accents of herb and tropical fruit. Straightforward apple, pear and nut flavors show on the palate.

63485,US,"Slightly odd-scented nose with hints of pipe tobacco, grapefruit, green apple and herbs.

Pleasant hints of oak show up on the finish.",Reserve,86,30.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Morgan
63486,US,"This smooth wine has good balance, and a fairly full mouthfeel.

63487,US,"The nutty, smoky notes on the nose are overshadowed by taut, high-octane alcohol-mineral scents. The stony, mineral-laden palate also shows earthy, apple-oatmeal flavors. The mouthfeel is full, yet tight (we could say ripe, but it's not fruit-driven wine). This unusual offering fades long but closed, with hints of spice and coffee. Previous tastings of Mt. Carmel have proved it a tough read when young. Hold and taste in three years.",Mt. Carmel Vineyard,86,35.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Babcock
63488,Australia,"The nose of this Bordeaux-like Cabernet displays strong herb and earth tones. Cassis, earth, dried herb and licorice flavors ride the even, medium-weight palate.

63489,Australia,"Ripe and buttery with tropical fruit and oak on the nose, this Chardonnay has decent mouthfeel and an attractive sweet-tart profile.

63490,US,"A good California Barbera, with medium weight, classic tart cherry flavors offset by leather and herb accents, and zingy, almost sharp acidity. Has good body and mouthfeel, and cries out for hearty food like big pasta dishes or cassoulet.",Barelli Creek Vineyard,86,19.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Barbera,E & J Gallo
63491,France,"Offers a bouquet of pear and anise, plus an earthy floral note. Richer flavors of apple and quince follow, with lime and toast accents. Displays a good acid spine and some class, finishing even and dry. This wine has nice parts.",Premier Cru,86,18.0,Burgundy,Montagny,,Chardonnay,Prosper Maufoux
63492,US,"The nose here delivers a hefty dose of meaty, smoky, nutty notes paired with mild pear and apple. The palate doesn't show complexity—a pronounced toasted oak rides hard on apple and pineapple fruit. It's balanced and finishes dry, but comes up wanting the desired texture and nuance.",The Sculptor Reserve,85,34.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,M. Cosentino
63493,US,"Lean and tautly balanced, this wine has an outdoorsy, mineral-and-hay bouquet and sweet herbal accents. Green apple flavors take over the palate, though hints of lemon and minerals also show up. Tasters didn't find anything terribly wrong here, just a lack of element that would make it more right. Finishes with lingering oaky notes.",Bien Nacido Vineyard,85,30.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
63494,US,"Crème brûlée and baked apple aromas on the nose open to a smooth palate of mild apple, pineapple and spice flavors with citrus accents.The flavors aren't vibrant, though, and the intensity of the oak rendered the faint fruit nearly invisible.",Fournier Vineyard,85,40.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Conn Valley
63495,US,"There's still a good and pleasant dose of pineapple and apple fruit accented by vanilla spice in this wine, but a mature and overly soft palate-feel suggests that it's best consumed near-term. Finishes smooth and light, with medium length. Drink up this year.",Clos des Pierres Reserve,85,45.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peter McCoy
63496,US,"Opens with a nice nose of roasted nuts, banana, caramel and a hint of smoke. The palate's pear, baked apple and apricot flavors wear interesting coconut accents, but all these are unfortunately overrun by a scotch notes peek out from behind an edgy acidity.",Hyde Vineyard,85,55.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ramey
63497,Australia,"There's a nice, jammy, berry and herb nose here with a touch of weediness among the fruit and cedar flavors on the palate. Light-to-medium-weight and smootly textured, it has balance, and berry and cocoa flavors. Singing on the nose, even on the palate, it's turns astringent on the back end.",,85,13.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,Merlot,Hope Estate
63498,US,"The deep gold color here suggests age, as do the soft, vaguely oxidized flavors.

Drink now.",Première Cuvée,85,35.0,California,North Yuba,Sierra Foothills,Chardonnay,Renaissance
63499,Italy,"From Apulia, in the Italian heel, a blend of Negroamaro and Malvasia Rosso. Long a supermarket favorite, the brand has always been rustic and powerful, but flavorful and inexpensive. Those are still its virtues. Big aromas of wild cherries and tar, with powerful berry flavors, it's dry and clean, the perfect gulp for barbecue.",Riserva,85,9.0,Southern Italy,Salice Salentino,,Red Blend,Taurino
63500,US,"Asian pear, but also dairy-like notes of cheese, sour cream and show on the nose. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy.

A good wine, but now reading ponderously—perhaps past its prime.",Bien Nacido Reserve,84,32.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Bernardus
63501,France,"A crisp nose of stone, lemon and grass opens this clean white made from Burgundy's other legal white grape. It shows nice lemon flavors, a touch of spice and a straightforward finish.

63502,France,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Malbec produced only in good vintages, this year's Verdillac is light but charming.

63509,US,"Were this from a more prestigious winery it would command a considerably higher price, but evaluated on its own merits it is a stunning success. There is a vivid, broad middle palate of black cherry, cassis and plum; a fine acid structure, and hard, stiff tannins. But there is also an elegant complexity, highlighted with flavors of earth and iron, that comes from the soil. They speak to the extra care taken in the winemaking process so as not to obliterate the fragile taste of terroir with excess oak or overripe fruit.",Walla Walla Valley Reserve,93,32.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Seven Hills
63510,Spain,"Starts with a crusty, almost mineral top over oaky, chunky blackberry fruit. It's a standard, semiherbal, juicy red blend (75% Tempranillo) with flavors of dried cherry and mocha.

63618,France,"True to Colombo's style, this is rather oaky, but with a few years of aging the oak has turned cedary, blending easily with iron and cassis. Long on the finish, with strong cinnamon notes. Drink now-2015.",Les Ruchets,90,80.0,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Syrah,Jean-Luc Colombo
63619,France,"Tavel is one of France's best-known rosés, and the local co-op (Les Vignerons de Tavel) accounts for approximately 45 percent of the appellation's production. Thankfully, at least from the 2005 vintage, quality is high and prices reasonable. There are several cuvées bottled and marketed in the U.S., but one of my favorite 2005s was Les Lauzeraie, which boasts lots of mineral and crushed stone aromas. It's quite fruit-driven and rich on the palate, full of cherries and watermelon, while the silky texture gives ita slight edge over some of the other cuvées.",Les Lauzeraies,90,13.0,Rhône Valley,Tavel,,Rosé,Les Vignerons de Tavel
63620,Chile,"This new wine from a venerable Chilean producer scores points all over the map.

63621,Italy,"Here is a more affordable wine created by the makers of Italy's legendary Sassicaia that has truly come into its own in 2004. The wine has a playful linearity to it accented by many rich mineral tones such as granite and slate roof. Take a second sniff and you'll get chocolate, leather and toasted nut. Good acidity, succulent tannins and persistence make it a stand out wine.",Guidalberto,90,50.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Sangiovese,Tenuta San Guido
63622,Chile,"This wine is the perfect model for midlevel Chilean Cabernet. It costs under $15 yet it overdelivers. The nose is firm and toasty, with serious berry and cassis aromas. In the mouth, it sings its way through wavy raspberry and vanilla flavors. Balanced and rich, with some creaminess and depth.",Gran Reserva,90,14.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,TerraNoble
63623,US,"Another pure-blooded varietal from Robert Karl Cellars, this sappy, reductive syrah needs a lot of airing out. Tart fruit grudgingly shows spicy raspberry/cranberry flavors.

63625,US,"Here's a rich, complex, savory Zin from the coolish south-central part of the valley.

63629,France,"Vigneron David Reynaud has only been apart from the co-operative for a couple of years, but this is an impressive effort.

63630,Italy,"There's a lot of action in the glass in the form of contrasting aromas and flavors: Chocolate, caramel, carob pod, balsamic sauce and Porcini mushroom offset cherry and berry candy.

63637,US,"There is a slightly sour, slightly sweaty aspect to the nose, and it affects the palate as well.

63640,Spain,"Typical of many 2002 Riojas, this packs a punch but doesn't hit many high marks. The nose is heavy and dark, while the plum and cherry flavors that carry the palate also have touches of green and bramble. Ample oak covers the wine and its weaknesses, and in Roda's skilled hands the wine isn't bad.",Roda Reserva,85,44.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Roda
63641,France,"Owned by the Mau family, this estate situated just above the Garonne river south of Bordeaux, is home to an exciting range of red wines.

63642,Spain,"The nose is floral and tropical, while the palate is clean, zesty and full of melon and papaya. For a basic, straight-ahead wine with no acidic curves or oaky bumps, this is commendable. Best if served well chilled, and in less serious settings.",,85,8.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Chardonnay,Coto de Hayas

63646,Spain,This is a nice little Viura (with 15% Chardonnay) that smells nutty and smooth and tastes of tangy citrus and other white stone fruits.

63661,US,"Comprised of 100% estate-grown grapes and barrel fermented in new French oak, this is Woodward Canyon's premier Chardonnay. The richness of the oak almost overpowers the nose, but when one thinks of premier cru Burgundy it's hard to tell the difference.

63668,US,"Although this winery has been a leading producer in the Walla Walla Valley for over two decades, this is only their second Walla Walla-designated Cabernet. Half of the grapes are estate-grown, half are from the Pepper Bridge vineyard. The smooth, chocolatey nose is a Woodward trademark and, despite its youth, the wine has a satiny mouthfeel.

63669,US,"This wine is at the extreme end of the spectrum for Sémillon, and has an avid following as a result. Golden yellow in color, it shows ultraripe fruit that smells of apricots, peaches and pine. The fruit supports a lot of oak. Winemaker Marty Clubb has a great touch with this often-overlooked grape.

It has a richness and ripeness in the cherry-flavored fruit, but retains the extra dimensions that Red Mountain soil imparts: flavors of iron, mineral and chalk.

63674,US,"Delivers almost everything you could ask for from a California Merlot. Plenty of plush, opulent fruit (blackberry and currant) and high-quality oak, and it tastes terrific. It has that pinpoint, laser-like quality you find in good wine. It's also very tannic: It numbs the palate and dries out on the finish, so it's best now with rich, fatty meats or age it and let it soften.

63700,US,"Whole berry fermentation and aging in neutral oak yield an aromatic, high-toned, fruity wine with a woody character—not new oak, but rather the flavor of neutral wood and gentle oxidation.

63704,Spain,"A pretty good Tempranillo-Garnacha blend with simple but fresh berry and plum aromas. The palate has snap but no overt acidic bite, while flavors of cherry and berry are slightly herbal and end with a mild buttery accent. A touch flimsy but keeps it together.",Old Vine,85,13.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Red Guitar
63705,Australia,"Although it starts out with woodsy scents, this blend turns sweet in the mouth, with jam tones gliding over a base of fruit liqueur.

63717,Argentina,"Granular, raisiny and heavy on the nose, with jammy blackberry aromas. The palate then hits with a thud; it's chunky and low in acidity, which yields a thick flavor set of prune and coffee. Better once it breathes, but it's still a bit too sticky and syrupy for our liking.",Reserva,85,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Norton

63739,Australia,"Has flavors of blackberry and grape. At this stage of its young life, this Shiraz is dominated by a veneer of oak, and seems flat, rather than vibrant, because of it. A year or two in bottle may yield a plumper, rounder wine.",,87,25.0,Victoria,Nagambie Lakes,,Shiraz,Tahbilk

63752,Chile,"Aromas of popcorn kernel, butter, petrol and oil don't work well, and despite the wine's flush, mostly balanced mouthfeel, it also doesn't deliver much in the way of flavor; the palate tastes burnt and bitter, with deadpan fruit.

63783,US,"Both of these outstanding vineyards contributed equally to this older (25+ years) vines Cabernet. It's sleek and sappy, and it serves up a full spectrum of berries as only Washington Cab can. Young, primary fruit flavors carry a lot of snap at the moment, and the bright acids suggest that a few more years in bottle will continue to improve this impressive effort.",GV Reserve Gamache–Champoux Vineyard Select,90,40.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gamache
63784,Australia,"Very minerally on the nose, with a twist of fresh citrus. The palate follows suit, with minerality and vibrant citrus characters meshing beautifully through the finish. Acidity is just lively enough. A very pretty wine that relies more on texture than overt fruit to shine.",Julius,90,30.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,,Riesling,Henschke
63785,France,"From a parcel planted in 1905, this is a blend of Grenache (60%) and an unusually high proportion of Mourvèdre (40%). From the start the Mourvèdre is apparent, imparting hints of cola and treebark and dark fruit flavors--even a hint of espresso. yet there's also peppery spice from the Grenache, and the wine avoids any sense of heaviness or rusticity.

63786,France,"Mature, but in no danger of senility, Guigal's 2003 Gigondas is a full-bodied, creamy-textured wine that reflects the ripeness of the vintage.

63787,US,"Chalone continues with its own style, which is not as ripely hedonistic as most other high-end Pinots. But this is the best since 1997.

Start drinking this elegant wine in 2008.",,90,35.0,California,Chalone,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Chalone Vineyard
63788,US,"Another spectacular effort, though they've bumped up the price significantly. This is beautifully varietal, mixing floral, bath powder, apple and grapefruit components in both the nose and the mouth. There is an elegant intensity that powers the wine through an exceptionally long, brilliant finish; the residual sweetness keeps the alcohol down to 11.5% without making the wine either soft or sugary. 14,500 cases produced.",,90,8.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Gewürztraminer,Columbia Winery
63789,France,"A bit advanced—likely because of the challenging vintage—but this is a nice rendition of white Hermitage from the fruitier eastern side of the hill.

63791,US,"This is a big, ripe Zin from a great vineyard in a warm part of the appellation. There's a lot of heat, but it works well with the blackberry pie, cherry tart and milk chocolate flavors.

63793,France,"Yves Cuilleron's style is not aimed at blockbuster levels of extract.

63797,US,"Soft, complex and delicious, this Zin comes from mountain vineyards grown high above the fogs of Anderson Valley, where the sun ripens the grapes well.

63798,US,"Morgan has hit its stride with this unoaked Chardonnay. Nothing comes between the intense citrus, pineapple, white peach, apple and spice flavors and your palate.

63800,US,"One hundred percent barrel fermented and aged sur lies, this polished wine brings the same lemon and lime and grassy flavors as Brander's unoaked Au Naturel.

63801,France,"A blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah, this is a surprisingly light-bodied wine for the vintage, yet wonderfully perfumed and floral on the nose. Ripe cherry and spice flavors aren't weighty in the mouth but instead are complex and supple—dare I say Burgundian? Hints of chocolate on the finish add an extra element of complexity. Mature; drink now.",Grande Reserve,90,20.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône Villages,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Château Saint Esteve d'Uchaux
63802,US,"This cool-climate variety loves it in the Sta. (formerly Santa) Rita Hills.

This will send chefs into food-pairing heaven.",Turner Vineyard,90,18.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Gris,Carr
63803,France,"A 50-50 blend of Marsanne and Roussanne, which gives this wine wonderful freshness and vivacity combined with layers of honeyed ripeness.

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Huber
63807,France,"Despite the slightly dark rosé color, this is a more mineral rendition of Tavel, with crushed stone and lime aromas.

63808,Australia,"Dark garnet-black in color, but as dark as it is, this is not one of those explosive, overextracted types of New World Pinot.

63809,France,"Yes, it's pricey for a Côtes-d-Rhône, but it's also excellent, and worth cellaring for a year or two prior to consumption.

63811,Spain,"While not that distinct, there's nothing wrong with this plump blend of 70% Verdejo and 30% Viura.

Better in the near-term; drink well chilled.",,85,13.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,White Blend,Hermanos Lurton
63812,Spain,"A touch saucy and soupy to start with, but airing sends it to a better place. This wine falls into the chunky and ripe category, with good but heavy black cherry and black plum flavors.

63813,US,"Nearly all Merlot, with just 5% Cab Sauvignon, this Bordeaux blend is from a vineyard in the cooler, southern part of Napa Valley, influenced by Carneros breezes.

63818,US,"The mouthfeel on this dry wine is as smoothly voluptuous as velvet, although there's also a thick dusting of tannins that are fairly astringent right now.

63819,New Zealand,"A solid, well-made blend, this packs in plenty of tobacco, vanilla and earth into a compact package.

63865,Chile,"This elegant wine opens with a bouquet of dark berry, toast and mint. This example of Carmenère shows the variety can yield fruit for dark, suave, well-balanced reds. The oak is nicely integrated and there's a long reprise of the opening aromas on the finish. Editors' Choice.",Cuvée Premium,90,28.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Carmenère,Château La Joya
63866,US,"This top-of-the-line Chardonnay from Columbia Crest gets extra time in barrel and bottle, and comes from the much-heralded 1998 vintage. It's a rich, creamy style, with less obvious buttery oak than the Grand Estates, but more complexity and a thicker, more complex feel to it. Flavors mix fruit, wood, spice and herb evenly. It has a comforting feeling of weight to it; it's not just up-front, aggressive flavors. Editors' Choice.",Reserve,90,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Columbia Crest
63867,US,"Very pale in color, with a slight coppery sheen and pronounced aromas of strawberry. It's very rich in the mouth, just loaded with fruity, spicy personality. Not quite dry, with just a trace of sugar. There's a nice creaminess to this crowd-pleasing sparkler.",Brut Rosé,90,27.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Champagne Blend,Pacific Echo
63868,New Zealand,"Smells rich and creamy, with peach custard, apple turnover, and cinnamon-smoke aromas and a hint of white chocolate and tangerine peel. The flavors have an oriental complexity, explosive, with waves of exotic fruits and spices, and yet it's dry as dust.",,90,12.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Spy Valley
63869,US,"Klipsun fruit is known for its firm tannins, iron and mineral elements, dark fruit and sturdy ageworthiness. Here a touch of the barnyard in the bouquet brings it ever closer to Bordeaux. It's a complex wine, which, despite its youth, shows a wonderful range of flavors, from black cherry to coffee to steel and smoke. The iron and acids and tannin are there to age, but it drinks beautifully right now, so why wait? Just 138 cases made.",Klipsun Vineyards,90,29.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wilridge
63870,Australia,"A chipper little wine, with some layers to the berry fruit and a note of coffee that sparks the medium-weight palate. Well-balanced, with vivid flavors that fan out on the finish, leaving a raspberry aftertaste.",Koonunga Hill,85,12.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon,Penfolds
63871,US,"High-toned, fruity with very ripe, compote flavors. Consistent with other Tagaris reds, it has very ripe fruit, no new oak, some volatility in the nose, and a suggestion of sweetness almost bordering on a late harvest style.",Alice Vineyards,85,34.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Mourvèdre,Tagaris
63872,US,"Tough in tannins, with a gritty mouthfeel, although it's also soft and jammy sweet. A blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, this rustic wine is a little hot in alcohol. Drink now.",Chorum,85,18.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Syrah-Cabernet,Villa San Juliette
63873,US,"Maybe this wine needs some age, but right now it's strong in sweet jammy raspberries and cherries, and the oak sticks out, like a caramelized, sweet vanilla coat. Yet it has good acidity and a fine, silky structure. If only it finished drier and firmer.",,85,36.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Woodside
63874,Australia,"Expressive, with exotic tones of guanabana and mango that give way to a buttery palate accented by fresh lemon.

Drink now.",Promised Land Unwooded,85,13.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Chardonnay,Wakefield Estate

63876,South Africa,"Full-bodied and intense for a rosé wine, the Lekkerwijn offers complexity in a dry, concentrated delivery. Savory and spicy with an herbal spin, the wine finishes long. Pair with spicy food, duck, game fish.",Solms Wijn de Caab Lekkerwijn,85,23.0,Western Cape,,,Rosé,Solms-Delta
63877,France,"A soft, earthy wine, with light strawberry jelly Pinot Noir flavors and a gentle series of tannins. The edge on this wine comes from the fresh acidity that brings out the lightweight final texture.",,85,,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Pinot Noir,Roger et Didier Raimbault
63878,US,"Too sharply acidic and jammy in cherries and raspberries, with a hard scour of tannins. It's tasty, but unsophisticated, even for Petite Sirah. Could surprise with lots of time in the cellar, but will never outgrow its rustic personality.",Fig Tree Vineyard,85,24.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Petite Sirah,Ballentine
63879,Spain,"Punchy berry aromas are floral and jumpy, and the palate is more sheering and tart than expected, but still fresh and clean. Zesty black cherry flavors are softened by buttery oak, and the finish is racy. Could use more flavor and depth along with less acidic bite.",Hito,85,20.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto Fino,Cepa 21
63880,US,"Pleasant flavors of cherries, raspberries and licorice, and a spicy finish. Feels too sharp in the mouth, though, with a cut of green acidity. But for the price, it's a pretty good Pinot.",Lot 165,85,15.0,California,Los Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Cameron Hughes
63881,Spain,"A better wine than the label's varietal Garnacha, so it seems as though the Tempranillo brings character and elevation. Wild berry and cherry aromas mix in citrus and spice, while the palate is fruity, with pepper and soft spice flavors. Turns a touch tart and toward cranberry the longer it's open.",Rojo Granrojo,85,9.0,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Bodegas Navarro López
63882,Italy,Castello Banfi's Tuscan expression of Sauvignon Blanc delivers the aromas you expect from this semi-aromatic variety backed by the creamy consistency you normally associate with sunny climates. There is slight softness in the mouth follow by crisp floral and fruit aromas.,Serena,85,,Tuscany,Toscana,,Sauvignon Blanc,Castello Banfi

Solid but basic, with minimal complexity and depth.",Saurus Patagonia Select,85,19.0,Other,Neuquén,,Merlot,Familia Schroeder
63884,Spain,"A little bit dark and crusty on the bouquet, with murky, earthy black cherry aromas that get clearer and cleaner with air. Briary plum and cherry flavors are solid if nothing else, and the finish is basically more of the same, with length. A competent wine, but that's where it ends.",,85,12.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,Tempranillo,Finca Antigua
63885,US,"You would be hard-pressed to guess the varietal in a blind tasting—it's generic red, almost 15% alcohol, cherry fruit, astringent tannins, some black olive and licorice. Quite drinkable but nondescript.",Genesis,85,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Hogue
63886,Australia,"Clean and subtle with intriguing musk scents and a medium-weight palate with orange peel and lemon fruit. While the palate is a bit lazy, there's a hit of acidity on the finish to keep things fresh. Drink now.",,85,20.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,Pinot Gris,Innocent Bystander

63890,US,"A bit tough and sharp, but not a bad Cabernet. It has deep flavors of blackberries, currants, cola, anise and cedar, and is bone dry. You can bet there's some declassified high-end wine in this blend.",,85,20.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Joseph Carr
63891,US,"Shows the ripe pineapple fruit, acidity, minerality and above all sweet, smoky oak that mark a rich California Chardonnay. But there's something off.

63892,Argentina,"A little stewy on the nose, with vanilla, liqueur and roasted berry aromas. The palate is young and vibrant, arguably teetering on sharp, with piercing cherry flavors and lots of oak. Flavorful but rough, with burnt brown sugar on the finish.",Henry Lagarde Reserve,85,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lagarde

63894,Spain,"Dusty, lightly oaked berry aromas are entirely regular, while the berry driven palate is dry, drawing and oaky, with pretty good body but stand-out acidity as well.

63895,US,"Here's a lusty, exuberantly fruity young wine, with jammy berry-cherry and spice flavors.

63896,Argentina,"Round, dark and slightly baked on the nose, with quasi-syrupy and creamy berry flavors that have plenty of the label's “oak cask” character.

63897,Greece,"Black fruit and mocha on the nose are followed by mocha, berry and cedar on the palate with this lively red. A touch of truffle and tobacco add to the appeal. Pair with lamb or grilled beef for added flavor.",Techni Alipias Red,85,27.0,Drama,,,Red Blend,Texnh Oinoy
63898,US,"Red Mountain is not especially known for its Gewürztraminer other than the late harvest wines from Kiona.

63917,US,"Purple and blue, it tastes of tart cherry and blueberry fruit.

63928,Spain,"Light and lean, with lively fruit aromas and flavors. Freshness is what this wine pushes, because there's not much weight or overt sweetness to it.

63929,US,"This complements the winery's “Rosso” and “Red” blends; it's the Bordeaux blend in the trio. The color is a bit murky, and the flavors, though pleasant enough, have a certain murkiness also, mixing earth, toast, hazelnut, some indistinct red fruits and a finishing lick of raspberry preserves.

Made with a splash of Grenache, it's full-bodied, bone dry and compelling in the intricacy of flavors.

63948,US,"A blend of several vineyards located near the winery, in the valley's famed Middle Reach, this is the biggest and richest of Williams Selyem's Spring 2007 releases. Full-bodied and soft, it shows ripe flavors of cherries, pomegranates, plums, sweet rhubarb, cola and sandalwood. Beautiful now and through 2013.",Westside Road Neighbors,93,67.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
63949,US,"A welcome return to form after the disappointing 2005. Massive, dark, saturated and spicy; laden with black fruits, smoke and charcoal. The dark flavors run right into bitter chocolate and roasted earth, but don't mistake the descriptors to suggest this is anything but extremely delicious, with a long and very satisfying finish. 100% Merlot, all estate grown.",Muleskinner Merlot,93,35.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Spring Valley Vineyard
63950,US,"Shows the plush ripeness of this vintage, offering a blast of cherry, raspberry, currant, mocha, licorice and smoky cedar flavors. Yet the balance is just fine, with crisp coastal acidity and richly textured tannins. Drink early for its youthful pleasures.",Bohemian Vineyard,93,44.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rockroom Winemaking Cooperative
63951,US,"This is a seriously good Pinot. It's easy to imagine drinking it at a great restaurant, with a fabulous steak. The tannin-acid structure is just perfect, and the texture is silky. Yet tasted at the age 18 months, it's a bit heavy in jammy cherries and raspberries, which suggests aging. Try holding off until 2011–2015.",Toboni Vineyard,93,56.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
63952,US,"Ultrarich and oaky, with vanilla, buttered toast, caramel and smoky flavors accenting the underlying pineapple, guava, nectarine and pear fruits.

63953,US,"There's a fine Pinot in here, but it's like buried treasure. Currently locked down with tannins, the wine shows extravagant flavors of dusty Asian spices, rhubarb, pomegranate, cola, cherryskin and sandalwood. Desperately needs time, but should be very fine. Drink 2011 through 2015.",Bien Nacido Vineyard,93,50.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Fess Parker
63954,US,"This is a reserve bottling of Goldschmidt's regular Vyborny bottling. It's essentially the same wine, but far more tannic, and perhaps a touch more concentrated. Dustily dry and astringent now, it seems like a guaranteed cellar candidate, with its rich core of blackberries, currants, mocha, herbs, anise and cedar. Better after 2011, and for many years.",Single Vineyard Selection Vyborny Vineyard Plus,93,150.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt
63955,US,"For the first time the fruit was sourced from Conner Lee vineyard old vines. It's a glorious wine, a near-perfect mix of citrus and stone, kissed with honey and dust, lightly buttery.

63956,Spain,"Dense and dark, with huge black-fruit aromas, toasty oak, chocolate and balsamic notes. Numanthia is ripe, rugged and intense, with in-your-face black fruit, coffee and burnt-toast accents. The feel and finish are deep as a cool well, and smooth as a whistle.

63957,US,"This lush, intricate and complex Pinot Noir really brings out the best of Russian River Valley. The fruit is enormously ripe, suggesting mashed cherries, blackberry jam, red licorice, cola and peppery spices, and the tannin-acid structure is just about perfect. The texture is right down the middle between silky-light and full-bodied. Beautiful now and through 2012.",Salzgeber Vineyard,93,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WesMar
63958,US,"This is always a tight, dry, tannic Pinot Noir due to its cool, low-yielding vineyard. The '06 is a very fine example. It's astringent and closed, but with a luscious heart of black cherries, red currants and Dr. Pepper cola. With decanting, it's fine now with something rich, like wild mushroom risotto, and should develop through 2012.",Wildcat Mountain Vineyard,93,40.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacRostie

63966,France,"Chapoutier's Les Meysonniers excels in 2005, bursting with floral-spicy nuances reminiscent of nasturtium and crunchy minerals. Still, it's soft and mouthfilling on the palate.

63969,US,"Sometimes lean, elegant wines appeal to specific tastes, and this is that kind of wine.

63970,France,"Don't tell the appellation contrôlée police, but this is 100% Viognier (not technically permitted under the Côtes-du-Rhône Villages AC), harvested late with ridiculously low yields, then barrel-fermented and -aged. The result is like liquified buttered nuts, honey and dried apricots. Or maybe it's melted orange marmalade, without the sugar. Only made in occasional vintages, this is a treat.",Cuvée Thérèse,90,62.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône Villages,,Viognier,Château Saint Esteve d'Uchaux

63973,France,"A technically illegal cuvée of 100% Grenache, this is really lush and ripe at over 15% alcohol, yet it doesn't show any heat. Instead, it's a mouthfilling explosion of fruit ranging from black cherries to yellow peaches, yet it's not at all heavy or fudge-like. With some time in the glass, slightly raisined notes appear. So drink it over the next year or two.",Heritage 1924 Rasteau,90,,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône Villages,,Grenache,Domaine des Escaravailles

63988,France,"Cool and minerally on the nose, but this is a rich, weighty Tavel, almost like a red wine, with some chewy tannins and firm grip.

64038,US,"Heavy and full-bodied, a dense, soft Pinot Noir that seems too ripe for comfort. The cherry and currant flavors veer into raisins.

64039,US,"Estate-grown, tart and tasting of citrus and green apple fruits. Despite the high acidity and generous (13.2%) alcohol, there is an impression of some sweetness.

64042,Argentina,"Big, roasted and full, with slightly earthy, burnt aromas to go with standard berry fruit. The palate is solid in feel, with herbal berry and tea flavors along with zesty acidity.

64043,South Africa,"Raspberry and cherry aromas are followed by juicy raspberries and cherries and a spin of spice. The mouthfeel is crisp but the texture lush and velvety. Overall not terribly complex, but a fun summer wine with an extravagant edge.",,85,10.0,Western Cape,,,Rosé,Graham Beck
64044,Spain,"Smells sort of gummy and candied, with aromas of red licorice stick, raisin and raspberry jam. The palate is sizable but comes with racy acidity, thus the flavors veer toward red fruits with an herbal accent. Burns a little on the finish due to sharp acids.",Cantos de Valpiedra,85,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Valpiedra
64045,US,"This Cab has some nice things going on in its velvety mouthfeel, but it's rather jammy-fruity and chocolatey, like a Starbucks coffee-based drink with a squirt of raspberry syrup.

64047,Spain,"Lightly stemmy and brambly, with lean red fruit aromas, a touch of saline and red licorice candy.

The score reflects both the wine's positive and negative features.",The Shizzle Reserve,85,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Townley
64049,Spain,"This is the prototype for an over-the-top, roasted, charred Tempranillo. The nose smells directly of burnt coffee, charcoal and grilled beef.

It has its merits but is still too blackened for our liking.",,85,20.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,,Tempranillo,Tritón
64050,US,"Deeply colored, almost black, with plummy edges, this wine sends out layers of scents: black fruits, coffee, smoke, pencil shavings and ash.

64052,US,"Harrison Hill includes a small amount of the second oldest Cabernet Sauvignon plantings in Washington state, which form the backbone of this blended red wine. Merlot (25%) and Cabernet Franc (11%) from the same vineyard complete the mix. Soft, plummy scents, reminiscent of old vine Zinfandel, rise from the glass. Harrison Hill is a cool site, and the grapes are often not harvested until November. The gentle flavors of plums, pie cherries, rose petals and anise reflect the extra hang time. Elegant, light and seductive.",Harrison Hill,90,45.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,DeLille
64053,US,"Charbonneau is Woodward Canyon's proprietary name for its white and red blended wines. The blanc is predominantly Sémillon, with 10% Sauvignon Blanc added to round it out. The nose is scented with freshly mown hay, spice and herbs. It has plenty of crisp fruit in the mouth, and a distinctive spiciness that begs to be paired with Thai food,  crab cakes or something with cilantro. Great food wine.",Charbonneau Blanc,90,28.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,White Blend,Woodward Canyon
64054,US,"An intense blue-purple wine, young, grapey and striking. The classic Klipsun core of iron/mineral is there, along with tight, spicy fruit, and plenty of acid for long-term aging.

64057,US,"The blend here is 39% Cabernet Sauvignon, 39% Merlot and 22% Cabernet Franc. The wine is dark, dense, what some call “brooding.” It is firm and tart up front, but stuffed with layers of oak and herb and cherry/berry flavor.

In recent years, it has included not only declassified Chaleur Estate, but some extra juice from Harrison Hill as well. It's always a lovely wine, forward, fruit-filled, warm and generous. The '98 is ripe and forward, with a little bit of heat in the finish. Clean and straightforward, without the extra layers of depth one finds in the Chaleur Estate.",D2,89,30.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,DeLille

64065,US,"The nose jumps from the glass, promising ripe, black cherry and cassis fruit, black pepper spice, and some high-toned “lift.” Round and succulent, it's a deep-colored, still grapey, sweet and lingering wine with nice pepper spice accents. Much more power than the winery's '97, it shows the strengths of the vintage, drinks well right now, and has the stuffing to cellar well for another half decade.",,89,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Canoe Ridge
64066,US,"This is a wine made for the cellar. It's dark, and smells rich, with ripe blackberry and plum fruit and a hefty dose of vanilla-scented, smoky oak.

Lovely now.",VSR,89,30.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Lockwood

64125,US,"Here's a big, rich, full-bodied Zin that calls for equally big foods, like tri-tip, barbecued ribs and Szechuan-style beef.

64126,US,"Young and thick in tannins, this Pinot will benefit from some time in the bottle.

64130,US,"This new vintage offers the same blend as the 2005—62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc.

64134,Spain,"Astrales has really nailed it the past couple of years, and while the '06 isn't quite as good as 2005, it's still an excellent wine.

64137,US,"Similar to the excellent 2005, this bottling needs some time in the cellar to let the fruit, tannins, acids and oak knit together.

Try toward 2010.",Tobias Glen,92,54.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
64138,Australia,"To me, Glen Eldon's Dry Bore Shiraz exemplifies many of the positive attributes of Barossa Shiraz. The blackberry fruit is powerful, complemented by copious vanilla and toast notes from oak maturation. There's plenty of weight and concentration, but no excessively dry or hard tannins—in fact, it's almost silky.

64144,France,"A controversial wine I'm sure, as I couldn't even make my mind up about it. Tasted from three separate bottles, on one occasion it was positively stunning and would have rated 94 points—it was filled with explosive stone fruit notes, ranging from peach and apricot to plum and cherry; lush but not unstructured.

64145,France,"A Marsanne- and Roussanne-dominated blend, this is ripe and honeyed—almost to the point of raising questions about its residual sugar levels.

64164,France,"Unusual for the region in that it's mostly Roussanne. The result is slightly more floral and expressive than most Saint-Joseph blancs, with pear and spice notes delivered in a plump, full-bodied format.

64292,Australia,"Aged in a combination of French and American oak, this is a best-barrel selection, not culled from a particular vineyard parcel.

64293,Germany,"This youthful auslese is still showing a lot of postfermentation estery characters: it's very perfumed and floral, with such tropical notes as banana and pineapple. The fruit is nearly overwhelming, and the wine is on the sweet side, so it's easy to overlook the underlying minerality, but it's there.

64299,US,"A classic combination, this pits earthy, muscular Cabernet Sauvignon against a roughly equal amount of spicy, peppery, audacious Syrah, taking the best from each.

64304,US,"Delicious and immediately appealing with fresh strawberry and Bing cherry fruit, leading into sweet toasty oak and the precisely detailed tannins that characterize John Abbott's winemaking.

64375,Spain,"Basa has long been one of our go-to whites from Rueda, but this vintage seems to be on the slide. The nose is oily and short, while the fruit is turning toward bitter. It still has some vitality and green fruit character, but our advice is to wait for the 2009. A blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo.",Basa,84,15.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,White Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
64376,Spain,"Light berry aromas carry a citrusy edge, while the crisp palate is lean but clean, with dry, peppery plum and cherry flavors.

64377,Spain,"Jammy smelling, with raisin and cough drop aromas. The palate maintains that jammy profile, while the flavors run creamy and short, with a lean toward strawberry and raspberry. A little grassy and green on the finish, with a final dose of candy.",Joven,84,12.0,Levante,Yecla,,Red Blend,Valle de Salinas
64378,US,"Could almost be a Zinfandel, it's so jammy-fruity in raspberries, cherries, red currants and pepper, with firm tannins and a solid dose of acidity. It's also slightly sweet and one-dimensional.",,84,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Tempranillo,Madrigal

64381,US,"Wineglass Cellars is a boutique producer whose focus has been on red wines; this, notes winemaker David Lowe, is their first Chardonnay that's “serious.” It takes the crisp structure of Washington fruit and adds a healthy dose of new oak, giving it plenty of toast, spice and vanilla. It's a winning combination, and sure to please. Just 277 cases made. Best Buy.",,88,13.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Wineglass Cellars
64382,US,"Some good fruit gives this wine a solid foundation. It's dark and rough, with black cherry and blackberry flavors, along with toasty coffee and some earthy ash. The tannins are on the rough and rugged side, and the wine has plenty of power. It finishes with hints of chocolate and tannin.",,87,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,E. B. Foote
64383,France,"This is a pretty, rose-colored wine, with an earthy scent of barnyard and light cherry fruit. The flavors emphasize the tartness of cherries with a fair bit of earthiness in the finish. This is good, plain, quaffable rosé, but tart and one-dimensional.",Cuvée Brut Rosé,87,34.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Devaux
64384,Australia,"Nicely built on a solid red fruit core, the berry, cherry and licorice aromas and flavors here wear a heavy wood cloak that holds the fruit in check a bit too much. It's hard not to feel that the full potential of the fruit has been stymied here. Still, the mouthfeel is good and it finishes with attractive, spicy dry cherry, anise and wood notes. Will appeal more to lovers of lavish oak.",Filsell,87,25.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Grant Burge
64385,US,"Here is a surprisingly light effort, with soft plum-flavored fruit, and gentle accents of lively, peppery spice. There's a hint of asparagus flavor here too, and the finish drops off very quickly. This is an excellent vineyard, and one wonders if the wine is just at a rather unfortunate, awkward phase of its development.",Seven Hills,87,36.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Merlot,Andrew Will
64386,US,"Bookwalter has done an exciting turnaround as a new generation takes the reins. This is a vivid, forward, toasty and inviting Cabernet. It shows nice, round fruit and plenty of toasty oak.

Not a big wine, but delicious and well made.",,87,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bookwalter
64387,US,"The apple, earth and mild tropical fruit aromas, good mouthfeel and apple-pear and caramel flavors are all right on target.

Drink now.",,87,16.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Lockwood

For fans of rich, oaky full-bodied Chardonnay.",,87,30.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Wattle Creek

64391,US,"This is a well-made, balanced effort with green apple fruit enhanced with hints of honey and allspice. Still quite young and tight, it is just beginning to soften up and show some nice toasted, roasted nuts in the finish. It isn't quite as intense as the Barrel Fermented Chardonnay from CSM; this is a slightly softer, more approachable wine.",Canoe Ridge Estate Vineyard,87,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Chateau Ste. Michelle
64392,France,"Devaux makes a yeasty, bubbly, straight-ahead style of Champagne. It's tart and tastes mostly of green apples, with just a faint hint of toast in the finish.

64393,Australia,"A well made 50-50 blend, this is loaded with black fruit. Perfect balance, a velvety mouthfeel and a long finish are other attributes. Food-wise, prime rib would be just fine. Best Buy.",,87,7.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz,Alice White
64394,US,"This is a 50/50 blend, made in a fruity, forward style. It smells of green berries and pears, and has an edgy crispness that will set up nicely with food. The finish is a bit astringent, dusty, herbaceous, and suggests fresh spices and new-mown hay. The Chardonnay half of the equation adds some tart, green apple fruit.",,87,9.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Semillon-Chardonnay,San Juan Vineyards
64395,US,"Hogue puts bright, black cherry fruit in the nose, even though the wine is still a bit tight in the glass.

64396,US,"Hogue emphasizes the fruit in their white wines, and this lip-smacking Gewürz is a good example of their style.

Best Buy.",,87,8.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Gewürztraminer,Hogue
64397,France,"Firm, structured wine which at present tastes young and rather unfocused. It is certainly rich and should develop well. The wood element is dominant at the end, but the fruit should come through to sustain it. The wine needs aging.",Vaudsir,87,,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Joseph Drouhin
64398,US,"Seems a little leaner and more compact than DiStefano's other '98s.

64399,Australia,"Here's one of the bigger Chards of the year. Explodes with aromas of butterscotch, caramel, vanilla, and, oh yes, tropical fruits. The flavors are mouth-filling and rich, like a sweet, custardy, creamy, tangerine-flavored dessert, yet it's dry. However, it loses a few points for being too big and aggressive without the necessary balance. It's awkward.",Giant's Creek,87,17.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,Chardonnay,Rosemount
64400,US,"Bright berries are all dressed up in cedary, pencil-like oak and kissed with velvety black-tea and creamy chocolate notes that linger through the finish.

64401,US,"A little more full-bodied than Royal Oaks's regular bottling, it also has black-cherry notes, but it's also earthier—and oakier, too—with currents of vanilla and dark chocolate. Still has a bite of acidity, which stings the palate, and demands food.",Westerly Vineyard,87,25.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Merlot,Royal Oaks
64402,US,"A fig, herb and grapefruit bouquet sets the stage.

Finishes dry, with just a hint of tartness.",,87,20.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Wattle Creek
64403,Australia,"An overripe quality to the blackberry-liqueur fruit, especially on the nose, marks this lovable sweet jam-fest.

64404,France,"The well-defined bright lime and mineral aromas and light peach-pear flavors ride a fine acid backbone.

64412,US,"This is loaded with mixed fruit flavors, in fact it's a bit of a fruit salad of a wine.

64551,Spain,"Starts out with gassy, earthy aromas that suggest heat and barnyard, while the palate is chunky and full, with stemmy black cherry, plum and berry flavors along with coffee and chocolate accents.

64552,Argentina,"Piercing leather, berry and foresty aromas lead to a zesty palate of medicinal cherry and raspberry flavors.

64633,US,"Absolutely delicious, first-rate Chard from this veteran producer. Shows the prettiest balance of all its parts, and just about as good as California Chard gets.

64634,US,"This luscious Pinot is impressive now for the power of its black currant, cherry, raspberry, vanilla, cola and Provençal herb flavors, with their firm backbone of acidity. It's the kind of Pinot that dazzles from the first sip to the last, as it evolves in the glass. The tannins are sweet and gentle, but supportive enough to allow this gorgeous wine to age for six to eight years.",Rapley Trail Vineyard M Block,95,45.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Thomas Fogarty
64635,US,"Tasted alongside its Russian River Valley sister bottling, released at the same time, this new wine from Sonoma-Cutrer founder Brice Jones shows far greater power. Just erupts with masses of sweet cherries and raspberries with a liqueur richness, and nuances of forest floor, pine needles and smoky oak. Really notable for balance. Citrusy acids and firm, sweet tannins give this Pinot, from way out on the Far Sonoma Coast, a brilliant structure. Beautiful now and for the next 10 years.",William Wesley,95,50.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Emeritus
64636,France,"From arguably the finest sweet wine vineyard in the Loire, here is a wine that is deceptively fresh on first taste.

64637,US,"Really just about the perfect Anderson Valley Pinot in terms of the beautifully crisp acidity, and the way the wine blasts pure flavors of red cherries, cassis and raspberries across the palate.

Combines all this massive power with elegant finesse in an effortless way.",Fog-Eater,95,35.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Drew
64638,Germany,"A stunningly rich yet balanced dessert wine, this beauty starts with hints of paraffin and almonds, then unleashes waves of sweet dried-apricot and orange-marmalade flavors.

Italy's Piero Incisa della Rocchetta of Sassicaia fame started this project in 2004, and it's now finding a groove. This wine is as elegant as Burgundy but as full of flavor as something from California. The color is rosy, the aromas beguiling, and the meeting of oak and fruit just perfect.

64765,Australia,"In an unusual twist, Yalumba's m/g/s gives Mourvèdre preeminence in the blend (60%), followed by 22% Grenache and 18% Shiraz. The result is a wine that lightens some of Mourvèdre's dark fruit and tree-bark tendencies with a dash of raspberries.

64768,Germany,"At 9.5% alcohol and with plenty of residual sugar, this is rather broad, but it still boasts excellent intensity and complexity.

64776,US,"At nearly six years of age, this Cab tastes as fresh and tannic as a far younger wine. Those tannins remain firm and hard, and the blackberries and cherries still have a primary fruit taste.

64782,Argentina,"From vines planted in 1932, this Pinot Noir is simply beautiful. It's bigger and more dense than its younger brother, No. 55, but maybe a tad less elegant and a bit more cellar worthy.

64785,US,"The difference from Luna's regular '04 Cab is in the increased alcohol, nearly 1% higher, and greater tannic structure.

It has great complexity, succulence and firm, dusty tannins.",,92,55.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Antolini
64797,Austria,"A beautifully elegant wine, blending three Austrian varieties with Merlot. Gernot Heinrich regards this as his flagship wine, and he has managed to make an impressive wine that keeps its richness and opulence well under control. The overall impression is of fresh cherries, plum skins, some toast flavors and a background of herbs and spice. A wine that should age 3–4 years.",Gabarinza,92,60.0,Burgenland,,,Red Blend,Gernot and Heike Heinrich
64798,Austria,"Dominated by Blaufränkisch, with St. Laurent and Zweigelt, Op (or Opus) Eximium was first made in 1988 (hence cuvée 17 for the 2004). This particular vintage is one of the finest, a suave, velour-like wine, with black plums, figs and dark, firm tannins all working together.

64800,US,"An interesting wine that shows its warm terroir in the softness and baked fruit quality.

64803,Argentina,"Closed and heavy on the nose, with baked-apple flavors and caramel. Weighs in as full-bodied, with toffee and bitter pith notes on the finish.

64817,Italy,"The nose is Granny Smith apple in as pure a form you can get in winemaking. But there's also a distant note of rubber balloon that, to be honest, I rather liked.

64839,US,"This young wine needs time in a decanter or vigorous swirling in the glass to dissipate some residual sulfur aromas, but it comes around to reveal lean black-cherry fruit accented by slightly bitter wood.

64890,US,"This 50/50 blend of old vine fruit from these two excellent vineyards is a bit overpowered by the massive amount of new oak flavor. The fruit may be a little more delicate than the barrels. Still a fine wine, loaded with cassis and blackberry fruit among the more substantial flavors of earth and tannin.

64892,France,"A refined and complex Syrah from the “Grand Cru” of Minervois la Liviniere.

64893,US,"A bit sharp, but saved by lush flavors of currants, mashed cherries and blackberries, and a drizzle of anisette, chocolate, black pepper and vanilla.

64894,US,"A dense, balanced Syrah that amply displays a complex mix of ripe fruits, hinting at raisins and spice, but not overloaded with either.

64895,US,"Feels a bit heavy now, with direct flavors, like cherry and chocolate cream pie filling without the crust. However, there are suggestions that aging will benefit.

64896,Argentina,"Clos de los Siete, the amalgmated product of Michel Rolland's Uco Valley wine commune, is rich, round and ripe, with deep aromas and trimmings like polished oak and minerality.

64912,Australia,"Vasse Felix's 2005 Shiraz offers up a powerful, pungent blend of stewed fruit, cedar and dried spices, resulting in a wine that impresses more for its power and intensity than its elegance.

Grown in the cooler Coombsville area, south of Stags Leap, the wine is bright and brisk in both acids and tannins that give it firm structure.

Sweet holiday spice, vanilla and plum make for an enjoyable nose, while the fruity, round palate is backed by tobacco and more spice. The rich fruit should pair well with hamburgers.",,85,13.0,Napareuli,,,Saperavi,Telavi
64967,Argentina,"Lightweight in its approach, but still sturdy. The bouquet offers melon, tropical notes and white flowers, while the palate deals mostly cantaloupe and banana.

65004,New Zealand,"A dry, steely Riesling that demands time in the cellar. Aromas of lime, with a hint of peach; assertive lime-citrus finish.

Drink it over the near term for its sheer intensity.",Wrecked,90,74.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Nashwauk
65058,US,"An outstanding example of Washington Merlot. It needs more bottle age, but has all the right stuffing. There is plenty of still-to-be-integrated new oak, toast, and a dark and earthy core. Note that the Loess (Leonetti) vineyard contributes to the blend. Decant this; it could be a real sleeper.",Reserve,90,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Waterbrook
65059,US,"Soft, luscious and bold, this velvety Cabernet brings great credentials, sourced from vineyards virtually adjoining Champoux. Don't look for Champoux-like density, but the black cherry fruit core is here, amped up with new French oak— and it handles it well. Roasted earth and black olive highlights add detail.",,90,34.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tertulia

The barrel tannins still need to soften up a bit.",,90,30.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tulpen
65061,US,"These old vines were planted in 1973, producing a graceful wine that just hints at more subtle notes under the primary fruit and new oak. Mixed red berry, currant and cherry flavors run into stiff tannins; with airing it opens out, revealing the brambly wild-fruit flavors of old vines, and introducing mocha and caramel.",Old Vine,90,28.0,Washington,Snipes Mountain,Columbia Valley,Cabernet,Upland Estates
65062,US,"Ripe and spicy, this is a very rich and fruity Gewürz, with moderate sweetness (1.6% residual sugar).

Goes down nice and easy, but shows considerable complexity.",Toulouse Vineyard,90,42.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Phillips Hill
65069,Germany,"With its delicate aromas of flowers, fresh greens and a hint of mint, you might expect this to be a light, delicate wine.

65070,Argentina,"Full, chewy, doughy, spicy and intensely fruity. This single-vineyard Malbec offers a little bit of everything, and all in balanced, measured doses.

65071,Italy,"Run by the Castellani family, this is a promising estate and one consumers should keep an eye on. This vineyard-designate cru strikes all the right chords: It's traditional and clearly territory-driven, yet it remains lush, generous and pleasing thanks to 32 months in oak casks and native yeasts.

65072,Germany,"An affordable BA, presumably from a variety of vineyard sites, this is relatively light in body, but it's still a sweet little wine. Fresh apple and citrus aromas and flavors fold in touches of cinnamon, finishing clean and fresh.

65073,Austria,"The 600-foot Schützner Stein broods over the Neusiedlersee, a great place to grow Blaufränkisch. Blended with Merlot, this is impressive, a powerhouse of dense tannins and black fruit.

65074,Germany,"Crisp and clean, with a long, delicately wrought finish, this is a throwback to the auslesen of earlier times, without heaps of sweetness, but instead playing off the fine balance between sugar and acid.

65076,US,"Our favorite of the three J. Lohr cuvées is this one, based on Cabernet Franc. The variety's floral, herbal notes mark the aromas, then give way on the palate to broad, mouthfilling flavors of brandied cherries and baking spices.

65080,Austria,"Velvet and smooth black fruits are on the surface of this Bordeaux blend.

65081,Germany,"Big and full-bodied, with just a touch of sugar in evidence, while the alcohol is up to 13%. Petrol and slate notes mark the nose, while the fruit features pineapple, nectarine and melon. Long, powerful and citrusy on the finish, with underlying minerality and spice that provides fascinating complexity.

65082,Austria,"This is the Feilers' flagship red, a blend of Blaufränkisch, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, smooth, ripe and velvety.

65083,France,"Aged in wood for 18 months, and made from old vines, this is a rich, botrytised wine, with wild flower honey, perfumed peaches and a deliciously piercing acidity.

65084,Italy,"This is a big, brawny, plush, “international” Amarone that sees 4 years of oak and delivers thick layers of espresso coffee, chocolate fudge, wood toast and honey nut.

65085,US,"The biggest of the winery's three '05s, this starts to approach Grenache in its voluptuousness and rich mouthfeel of cherries and cocoa.

65086,Argentina,"Since coming onto the scene with the 2002 vintage, this Chilean-run venture (Montes S.A.) has hit the right notes time after time.

Very modern, but done in the right way.",Ultra,91,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Kaiken
65087,US,"Dry and tannic compared to today's lush, over-the-top Napa style, this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend hearkens back to the old Inglenook and Martini Cabs, which were ready to drink on release, yet aged for a long time.

65089,Austria,"First created in 1992, this international blend is a fine contribution to Bordeaux-style wines around the world.

65090,France,"One of a range of three single-vineyard dry wines from Jo Pithon, this is the firmest, needing long aging as the Chenin develops its secondary flavors.

65093,Austria,"A blend of Zweigelt, Blaufränkisch and Merlot, this is Pittnauer's top wine, a smooth and ripe, with a brushed velvet texture. The surface softness only masks the power underneath.

Richly viscous in the mouth, much like a good Alsatian vendages tardives.",Reka,90,,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Kim Crawford
65141,Italy,"Plenty of leather, cassis, plum and tobacco aromas show on the nose of this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The full palate has full, dark berry Cabernet flavors and pronounced tobacco-herb-earth shadings. Has depth and character, but also shows a slightly rustic feel with full tannins, espresso flavors, herb and bell pepper notes on the finish. Best held until 2004.",Cortaccio,90,50.0,Tuscany,Tuscany,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Villa Cafaggio
65142,US,"Soft and juicy, with a lot of sweet, ripe, up-front fruit flavors, including blueberries. Deft and supple, with elegant, modulated tannins and low acidity. Creamy and rich, this is a very pleasant, fruit-driven wine that offers solid enjoyment. Editors' Choice.",Notorious,90,18.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Franc,Tobin James
65143,New Zealand,"The intense combination of vanilla, cassis and black-cherry aromas results in an almost syrupy sensation—before even tasting the wine. On the palate, it is rich and full, but not cloying in the least, thanks to juicy acids and a strong streak of mint. Mildly tannic; can be drunk now or aged a few years.",Gimblett Road,90,30.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trinity Hill
65144,US,"Comes down on the lemony side, but not aggressively so. The citrus is balanced with creamy, oaky, herbal notes that soften and add complexity. Dry, with a great deal of lemon-and-lime extract, slightly soft, but very elegant. This is a stylish wine, exceptionally well balanced, and one of the better Sauvignon Blancs of the vintage.",,90,20.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars
65145,US,"What a great color on this ripe, full-flavored wine. It opens with heaps of blackberry and green olive aromas and moderate smoky oak.

65146,New Zealand,"In a hot vintage like 1998, Kumeu's proprietary blend of Merlot (65%), Malbec (30%) and Cabernet Franc (5%) gets ripe enough to avoid any suggestion of weediness. Strong cinnamon notes from new oak complement plush black-cherry fruit. Anise and leather nuances spice up the finish.",Melba,90,23.0,Kumeu,,,Red Blend,Kumeu River
65147,US,"The full bouquet displays impressive depth to its blackberry, mint, tobacco and herb scents. The palate is dense, with cassis, chocolate and licorice flavors accented by plenty of spicy oak. Long and spicy, the finish is even, with dark berry and tobacco notes. Has appeal now, but will be better if cellared two to five years.",Reserve,90,30.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Fetzer
65148,New Zealand,"Corbans' top-of-the-line red is a big wine in the warm '98 vintage, filled with rich cassis and black-cherry fruit tinged with licorice and graham-cracker crumbs.

65149,New Zealand,"The wine that made Marlborough famous continues to impress, vintage after vintage. Ripe gooseberries and a hint of grapefruit flow through the broad midpalate into a long, lime-tinged finish. Rich enough to pair with sauced fish dishes, yet bright enough to go with simpler preparations as well. Editors' Choice.",,90,24.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Cloudy Bay

65154,New Zealand,"A wine that amply demonstrates the importance of site and barrel selection, as it lacks the weediness found in the non-vineyard-designated bottling. Instead it has ripe cassis and blackberry flavors marked by an intriguing hint of hickory smoke.",Matheson Vineyard,89,17.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Matua Valley
65155,New Zealand,"The philosophy here is to rely on bottle age to bring the acids into balance, rather than doing a lot of malolactic fermentation. The current release is this '97 when most producers are onto the '99s.

65160,US,"A disappointment, given the wine's origins in a good vineyard. Smells troubled from the start, with an unripe, vegetal aroma.

65161,Australia,"Here's a choice for those who find most Australian Chardonnay overwhelming. St. Kilda's take is subtle, with some restrained pomelo notes laying over a base of popcorn and hay. There's not much fruit here though, and the finish drops short. Drink up.",,82,9.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Chardonnay,St. Kilda
65162,Spain,"Candied on one hand but also gassy, barnyardy and less than clean and pure on the other.

Fails to impress.",,82,9.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Bodegas Copaboca

Weak on the finish as well.",Rojo Granrojo,82,9.0,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,,Garnacha,Bodegas Navarro López
65164,Spain,"Smells like compost, and never does that earthy, stenchiness lift. The palate is thick and muddled, with wan, dry, buttery raspberry flavors that lack direction. Finishes dry and bland, without much structure.",Roble,82,20.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Convento Oreja
65165,US,"Too sweet by far, with sugary flavors of berry-cherry pie filling. The sweeteness is compounded by high alcohol and glycerines.",J.D. Hurley,82,23.0,California,Santa Clara Valley,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Martin Ranch

65168,Argentina,"Not bad on the nose, where you get some tropicality, buttercup and flower blossom. But once you get onto the palate things go south.

65169,US,"Not showing well now, unless you like your wines superripe to the point of sweetness, soft and hot.

Fundamentally drinkable, but not a very interesting wine.",Thérèse Vineyards Lester Family Vineyards,82,35.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Syrah,Martin Ranch
65172,Spain,"Smells candied as well as burnt and stemmy. The palate is adequate on the surface but hollow in the middle, with dry, herbal raspberry flavors. Tastes more stemmy and distracted the longer you play with it. Not ready for prime time.",,82,10.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Monastrell,Merum
65173,Argentina,"Aromas of applesauce, lemon cake and lychee are probably the best part of the wine. In the mouth, it's chunky and wan, with candied, sweet apple and melon flavors. Finishes heavy, and overall it seems to be on an early fade.",Festivo,82,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Monteviejo
65174,Argentina,"Maybe this wine is already past its prime, but given that we aren't that familiar gauging barrel-aged blends of Sauvignon Vert, Pinot Gris, Chard and Torrontés, all we can say is that it comes across odd, resiny and heavy.

65178,Spain,"Dull aromas of raspberry and plum skins turn sweeter with air, but the palate is too centered on thick, creamy, generic berry flavors that turn raisiny and chunky with time.

65180,Argentina,"Much of what's wrong with Argentinean Chard is on full display here. The nose is stalky, hot and oily, with little freshness of fruit.

It works, because this has delicious black fruits, taut tannins, layers of spice and herbs and a backbone of refreshing acidity. The tannins suggests aging potential—perhaps 4 years.",Terra O.,91,48.0,Burgenland,,,Red Blend,Johann Heinrich
65227,Austria,"Made from 40-year-old vines, this blend, dominated by Zweigelt, but also with some Blaufränkisch and Cabernet Sauvignon, is concentrated and intensely fruity, with an elegant, smooth texture that only hints at the concentrated tannic structure underneath. It's not hugely powerful; it's more sensuous and deliciously long-lasting.",Hallebühl,91,60.0,Burgenland,,,Red Blend,Umathum
65228,US,"Vine Cliff is in the serious Cabernet business, crafting Cabs that aim for early drinkability but long ageability. The '04 is a success. It may lack the extra edge for profundity, but is delicious now for its oaky flavors of black currants, cassis, plums and mocha. Yet such are the tannins and acids that it should easily negotiate the next ten years, if not longer.",,91,75.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vine Cliff
65229,US,"Lovely mountain Zin, showing a briary, brambly quality to intensely flavored wild blackberries, blueberries and cherry liqueur.

65230,Italy,"Founded in 1870, San Rustico has recently done a lot of work in the winery and vineyard to maintain a quality edge. This Amarone boasts great intensity and delicacy of aromas.

65231,France,". From a small south-facing parcel next to the Clos du Papillon vineyard, this is a hugely rich wine, maybe excessively so. It comes from the hot 2003 vintage, and the grapes were obviously superripe. It's round, full-bodied, with ripe quince and white fig flavors. Is there minerality there? It's hard to find, just revel in its opulence. Screwcap.",Trie Spéciale,91,38.0,Loire Valley,Savennières,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine des Baumard

65233,Austria,"Any thought that Austria cannot produce world-class reds would disappear with this wine. A blend of Zweigelt, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, it is powerful, rich and spicy, with dense black cherry and new wood flavors. The touch of nutmeg sprinkled over the juicy fruit adds an exotic touch.",Premium Gradenthal,91,35.0,Thermenregion,,,Red Blend,Christian Fischer

65235,Germany,"Reasonably priced, this fruit-bowl auslese boasts hints of dried apricot, heaps of ultraripe stone fruit and just enough citrusy notes for balance. It's a more classic vintage, so not as rich or unctuous as the 2003s or 2005s, but leaner and more focused, with a balanced, fresh finish.

65237,US,"This year the blend is Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. As always, the wine is rich, complex, ageable, and unique among California reds. Zin brings its distinctly briary, wild berry taste to the pedigree of the Bordeaux varieties. The result is a balanced, elegant and refined wine that will stand five to eight years of age. A great accomplishment, with nearly 13,000 cases produced.",Red Wine,91,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,Paraduxx

65239,France,"A heavily wooded wine, very juicy with high acidity. At the moment, it is only wood.

65245,US,"Here's a big, ripe, dry, complex, voluptuous Pinot that comes from a cool Monterey region better known for dry whites.

65246,Italy,"Here is a refreshing approach to Amarone only because this wine is not overextracted or concentrated.

65312,Spain,"Burnt smelling at first, and tart throughout, with pie cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors. There's not much to measure here; the wine runs sour and tastes mostly of red fruit skins and citric acid. 65% Tempranillo and 35% Garnacha.",Bardosa,81,9.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Bodegas Lomablanca
65313,Argentina,"Green, grassy and not very appealing. There's a can't-miss murky, green, herbal character here that yields almost weedy fruit flavors and carob. Sweet, candied, green and just not that good for a Paul Hobbs-made wine.",Felino,81,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Viña Cobos
65314,Argentina,"Off the grid in terms of aromas, which hint at blueberry and candy but don't seem right or familiar. The palate is grainy and jammy, with raisiny flavors as well as souring acidity. Herbal and then bland on the short finish.",Dos por Cuatro,81,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Andes Grapes
65315,Spain,"Way too charred and roasted. The mouthfeel is acceptable and ranks as the best part of the wine. The rest is just a burnt, charred, overoaked mess with flavors of earthy berry, leather, peanut and resin. A poor effort that makes you wonder what the winery was thinking.",Elaboración Especial,80,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Beronia
65316,Spain,"Flat and gaseous smelling, with sulfur and no fruit to speak of. Tastes like bland nectarine and tangerine, and the body and finish are almost flabby. Borderline in terms of its acceptability.",Pindal,80,9.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo-Viura,TorresManur
65317,Argentina,"Wines like this are why Argentina would be best served sticking to reds. This has no bouquet to speak of, and the palate is dilute, tangy, citrusy and sharp. Acceptable but that's it.",Famiglia Bianchi,80,12.0,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Sauvignon Blanc,Valentin Bianchi
65318,Spain,"Soft, chunky and fading fast, with aromas of asparagus and canned green beans. The palate is flat as a board, with vegetal flavors and bitterness on the finish. Barely worth a sip at this point in its evolution.",,80,15.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Aromal
65319,Spain,"If it weren't for the wine's stout color and pretty good mouthfeel, we'd sink it. The nose is green and cheesy, and the flavors are also green almost to the point of vegetal. Stemmy on the finish.",,80,20.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Red Blend,Finca Constancia

65321,Argentina,"Yellow and chunky, and definitely on the way toward the grave. Mustardy aromas are severely short on freshness, and the palate is just as flat, dull and mealy as the nose.

65325,Italy,"This sweet wine from Italy is guaranteed to blow your socks off. Its thickness and density resembles concentrated maple syrup or molasses.

65328,US,"Feels fancy and important in the mouth, with pure, refined tannins housing ripe, complex flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherries, chocolate, exotic spices and sweet, smoky oak. The finish is dry but with a tinge of sweetness, like an infused blackberry liqueur, which probably is the result of high (15.3%) alcohol. Very rich and layered, and a great addition to the Napa cult pantheon. Cabernet, with Cab Franc and Petit Verdot.",,97,140.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Continuum
65329,Italy,"Made with Malvasia Toscano and Trebbiano grapes (unlike the slightly more complex Occhio di Pernice Vin Santo, which is made from Sangiovese), this is a delightfully rich and concentrated sweet wine that boasts unreal levels of intensity and personality.

65330,US,"This is really a spectacular wine. It's hard to say why it's so superior to Krutz's 2005 bottling, but it's richer and more elegant in every respect. Combines immense power with great finesse. The refined essence of blackberries, black currants and spices thrills the palate, accented with the most beautiful coating of smoky oak. A great achievement that should develop in the bottle through 2018.",Stagecoach Vineyard,97,70.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Krutz
65331,Argentina,"If the color doesn't tell the full story, the nose will: it's impeccably perfumed, round and sweet, with amazing fruit aromas and a toasty background.

65333,US,"What a roll Fess Parker Winery is on with their '08 Chardonnays. Not only great wine, but priced so well. This wine, sourced from Parker's U Block in this famous Santa Maria Valley vineyard, is as rich as any Chardonnay of the vintage—just massive in pineapple, pear and buttered toast flavors. Yet it's crisp and tart, clean and bracing in its minerality. Only 115 cases produced.",Bien Nacido Vineyard,96,28.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Fess Parker
65334,US,"This is an extraordinarily rich and rewarding Cabernet to drink now. Drenched in all new French oak, it's elaborate in spicy, charred wood and vanillins, but the underlying wine easily supports that weight. It's flamboyant in blackberries, cherries, chocolate, red licorice and cola. The alcohol seems high, but that's in the modern style, and there's no denying the sheer lusciousness.",Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard,96,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Carter
65335,France,"From a parcel within the Chevalier-Montrachet vineyard, this is beautifully balanced, but a wine with considerable potential. It is rich, but thrust through with a sword of steel, giving acidity that offers a succulent counterpoint to the yellow fruits. The wood is becoming well integrated, offering further richness. For long-term aging.",La Cabotte,96,660.0,Burgundy,Chevalier-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Bouchard Père & Fils

65337,US,"This is De Loach's finest Zinfandel of their five new releases. In fact, it's their best Zinfandel ever, and one that defines Sonoma County cool-climate Zinfandel.

65341,US,"This is all Birch Creek vineyard, barrel fermented, 100% malo, about one third new wood, one third one year, the rest neutral.

65343,Argentina,"All sorts of smoky berry, cola and controlled toast aromas get this wine going in the right direction.

65344,US,"Tight and reductive, the nose of this Bordeaux blend shows tar, rubber and smoke. The palate follows with nicely concentrated black cherry and cassis, detailed with leather and tobacco.

65348,US,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is all old vine. Despite its substantial alcohol, almost 15%, the wine is still showing some lean hints of green bean.

65352,Argentina,"A five-grape mash-up with savory aromas of roasted oak, smoke, bacon and clove aromas.

65354,US,"This Chardonnay marches to its own beat. It's not one of those oaky, ultra-ripe wines, but instead shows a dry, herb-infused minerality you might call Chablisian. Shows modest fruit flavors of pineapples, while the oak is restrained. Drink this elegant Chard now.",Merrillie,89,27.0,California,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Steven Kent
65355,Argentina,"Deep purple in color and fierce on the nose; there's no shortage of piercing French oak aromas to send this one on its way.

65357,US,"This is a polished, pretty wine of great power. It displays a dazzling array of red and black cherry, raspberry, currant and licorice flavors, tinged with mocha and cedar.

This is an inky, dense wine (more syrupy than it is vinous) with black currant, peppermill, chocolate fudge and big firm wood tannins. It is so monolithic, a viable food match is virtually impossible. As always, Dal Forno straddles a fine line between brilliance and exaggeration.",Vigneto di Monte Lodoletta,90,535.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Dal Forno Romano
65394,France,"Damien Laureau is a new name in Savennières, taking over in 1999 from his uncle. As with all Savennières, this is dry, but the wood aging rounds out the fruit to give a superrich wine. Flavors of mango and pear jam go with the smooth vanilla of the wood. It feels sweet, but tastes dry. The acidity keeps the alcohol at bay.",Les Genêts,90,23.0,Loire Valley,Savennières,,Chenin Blanc,Damien Laureau
65395,Austria,"Since 1992, Hans and Kurt Feiler have produced what they call the 1000 Series, a blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. This 2005 vintage follows the same theme, keeping close to a Bordeaux model, while adding extra sweetness and ripeness to the fruit. Wood aging helps soften the wine, but it is also a question of soft tannins and richness.",1011,90,52.0,Burgenland,,,Cabernet Blend,Feiler-Artinger
65396,Austria,"There's considerable richness in this broad, generous, velvet-  textured wine that brings out the red fruit and ripeness. The 18-months barrel aging have not dampened the fruit, but have certainly contributed to the power of this impressive wine.",Premium Merlot,90,50.0,Thermenregion,,,Merlot,Christian Fischer
65397,France,"The honey aromas from the dominant Chenin Blanc are enticing. The palate is fresh and soft, but rounded with melon and kiwi flavors. Delicious and full. Clos de la Briderie runs its vineyard biodynamically.",Vieilles Vignes,90,,Loire Valley,Touraine Mesland,,Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay,Clos de la Briderie
65398,US,"The blend in this Pauillac-inspired cuvée is based on Cabernet Sauvignon, resulting in a wine that's slightly more structured than the others. Tobacco and cassis pick up hints of toffee and brown sugar on the finish. Drink now–2015.",Cuvée Pau,90,56.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,J. Lohr
65399,Austria,"You can tell this is Gerald Malat's flagship red by the weight of the bottle. And, yes, it is a fine wine. The Cabernet structure and dry tannins are all here, as part of a firm, blackberry fruit-flavored wine, that shows some herbal character as well as wood. Age for 3 years.",Reserve,90,48.0,Kremstal,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Malat
65400,Bulgaria,"Oak plays a large role in this wine, with plenty of vanilla flavor and aroma intermixed with hung meat and pepper spice. This wine has a dark feel, with big tannins, but it still manages to be round in the mouth, with a peppery, tannic finish.",,84,8.0,Thracian Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vini
65401,Italy,"The wine opens with the fruity intensity typical of Pinot Grigio, but remains one dimensional and stops short of delivering intricate aromas. The same can be said of the wine's impact in the mouth.",Riff,84,10.0,Northeastern Italy,Delle Venezie,,Pinot Grigio,Alois Lageder
65402,Germany,"Light and frothy, this isn't quite as vinous as the Chardonnay sekt from Am-Turm. Instead, there's ginger, lime and cilantro aromas and wet-stone and lime flavors that finish clean and dry.",Turm-Exquisit Brut Sekt,84,23.0,Pfalz,,,Weissburgunder,Am Turm
65403,Romania,"Nice fruit aromas of blueberry and plum mingle with tobacco, with graphite adding to the mix in the mouth. Dry and light-bodied, this wine is linear in its fruit, but rewarding.",Rosso di Valachia,84,15.0,Dealu Mare,,,Red Blend,Byzantium
65404,Italy,"The nose certainly doesn't grab out at you but it does deliver delicate floral notes, almond paste and ladies' hand-cream-like aromas. Because it appears a bit heavy in the mouth, it calls for tart foods such as endive salad with mustard-balsamic vinegar vinaigrette.",,84,13.0,Northeastern Italy,Friuli Grave,,Pinot Grigio,Cà del Sarto

65406,Italy,"The flatter Friuli Aquileia area has produced a wine with notes of green grass and some vegetal tones with peach and melon. But the ensemble seems slightly disjointed, and the wine is light and simple in the mouth.",,84,14.0,Northeastern Italy,Friuli Aquileia,,Pinot Grigio,Foffani

65410,US,"It's hard to understand how they got this massively ripe fruit from grapes with only 13 percent alcohol. Theories abound. It tastes late-picked, almost porty, with currant, coffee and chocolate flavors, and is full-bodied and dry.",,84,30.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Guerrero Fernandez

65412,Argentina,"Simple and floral; not concentrated. This lightweight is tasty enough and overall it's balanced. The palate deals citrus, melon and crispness, and the feel is lively and juicy. Tastes more like Spanish Albariño than Chardonnay.",,84,6.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Funky Llama
65413,US,"Light to medium in body, and perfectly dry, this Cháteauneuf-style wine is explosively ripe in berry fruit, with a pronounced edge of raisins.

65416,Italy,"Starts off with yellow rose, apple cider, clove and bread dough aromas.

65422,Romania,"A blend of Pinot Gris, Gewürtztraminer and the indigenous Feteasca, this wine offers perfumey scents of lychee fruit and orange blossom with some animal musk.

65423,Brazil,"Pretty nice for a Brazilian sparkler, with a sweet, frosted-cake nose that's a bit gassy. Plump and candied on the palate, with apple and melon flavors. Loud and full, but clumsy. Shows good base qualities; needs refinement.",Brut,84,13.0,Brazil,,,Sparkling Blend,Cordelier
65424,Hungary,"This wine shows the peppery side of Gewürz, pairing it with papaya and lychee in the mouth.

65428,Georgia,"This wine still has a purple color after six years, and fresh aromas of purple fruit, vanilla, and some bramble. Oak is displayed in the mouth with a dusty but smooth feel, counterbalancing the good acid, while the purple fruit is strong, although showing some green stemmy notes.",,84,13.0,Georgia,,,Saperavi,Telavi
65429,Australia,"Has aromas of earth, mushroom and berry; on the palate, the berry fruit is very ripe, with a citric, almost spritzy edge. Soft in the mouth otherwise, but wants a little more stuffing midpalate.",Yellow Label,84,12.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Merlot,Wolf Blass

65433,New Zealand,"Pungent; filled with boxwood and gooseberry aromas, this is a character-filled wine that's not for the faint-hearted. The mouthfeel is ripe and weighty, nicely balanced by a tart, bitter-grapefruit-pith finish that lingers enticingly on the tongue.",,88,18.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Fairhall Downs
65434,New Zealand,"This blend of Riesling (usually 60–70%) and Müller-Thurgau gets musky, spicy notes from the M-T, while the bulk of the flavors and aromas are apricot and orange from the Riesling. Sweet and fairly low in alcohol (10%), this would make a nice pairing with various fruit desserts.",Noble School Road Late Harvest,88,18.0,Canterbury,,,Riesling,Giesen
65435,New Zealand,"Rich cassis aromas also carry a leafy, tobacco-like note. Then some chocolate emerges on the palate, along with dried herbs. Despite this wine's Cabernet content, it's ready to drink now.",Reserve,88,24.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Coopers Creek
65436,New Zealand,"Toasted oats impart a mealy texture and sophisticated complexity. The fruit core consists of oranges and nectarines, shot through with tropical fruits. Finishes clean and bright. Easy to like and easy to drink.",Ormond Estate,88,25.0,Gisborne,,,Chardonnay,Brancott
65437,New Zealand,"Elegant and well-integrated, with the oaky touches of caramel and toast playing off black cherries and a faint stemminess that gives added grip to the faintly tannic finish. Nice wine at a nice price for Pinot.",Reserve,88,17.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Brancott
65438,New Zealand,"Ripe, lightly buttered pears are tinged with a light muskiness and married to tropical fruits like guava in this soft, easy-to-drink wine that tastes like Chardonnay, without the overlay of oak to which consumers are so accustomed.",Unoaked,88,17.0,Marlborough,,,Chardonnay,Kim Crawford
65439,US,"This dry, earthy wine succeeds with soft but intricate tannins and bracing acidity, together with a rich, hearty mouthfeel. The fruit could be a little more polished. Nonetheless this wine is complex, and a good companion to a wide range of foods.",Signature Red,88,9.0,Texas,Texas,,Red Blend,Llano Estacado
65440,New Zealand,"A blend of barrel-fermented (60%) and tank-fermented (40%) juice, that displays elegant pear-citrus flavors combined with toasted marshmallows. The oak shows strongest on the finish, where it develops caramel and spice notes.",,88,17.0,Central Otago,,,Chardonnay,Mt. Difficulty
65441,New Zealand,"Despite the fact that Otago isn't known as Sauvignon Blanc country, winemaker Matt Dicey has bottled a lean, racy Sauvignon that's herbaceous, not vegetal.

65442,US,"Dark as you'd expect and chock full of elaborately crafted dark stone fruits. For all its outsized flavors, it's soft in both acidity and tannins; yet, there's something robust and chewy about it, enough so that it could accompany rich meats. It's well made and nicely balanced.",Ranchito Canyon Vineyard,88,18.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Petite Sirah,Tobin James

65444,New Zealand,"The cool climate of Canterbury shows through in this wine's lemony fruit and tangy acidity. Add to that a touch of toast and a custardy, leesy mouthfeel and the wine comes out a winner.",Reserve Barrel Selection,88,20.0,Canterbury,,,Chardonnay,Giesen
65445,New Zealand,I've recommended this wine in previous vintages and the 2000 is another fine example. There's a fair degree of sweetness (17g/L residual sugar) but it's balanced by a slight pétillance and zesty acidity. Ripe peaches and pears turn to oranges and limes on the finish.,,88,16.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Grove Mill
65446,New Zealand,"Shows restrained oaking, with subtle toast and menthol aromas serving to accent the delicate peach and pear flavors. Well-balanced, this would be fine with many lighter fish dishes or poached chicken breasts. Best Buy.",,88,15.0,Marlborough,,,Chardonnay,Selaks

65448,New Zealand,"Starts off with appealing oatmeal and toast aromas that complement ripe peaches and oranges. The fruit shines on the palate up until the finish, when some rough oak edges show through. Like all of the Te Awa Farm wines, the texture really stands out: a perfect blend of weight and viscosity that's mouth-filling without being heavy.",Longlands,88,16.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Chardonnay,Te Awa Farm
65449,New Zealand,"Features a sandy, earthy, beetroot character on the nose, then sweet black-cherry and tea flavors on the palate. The long, moderately tannic finish suggests it will hold for a few years, but it's enjoyable even now.",,88,26.0,Martinborough,,,Pinot Noir,Palliser Estate

65453,New Zealand,"A bigger, richer wine than Te Awa Farm's Longlands Cabernet blend, this Merlot is packed with black-cherry and chocolate aromas and flavors. A supple texture makes this drinkable now, but some black-tea notes on the finish argue in favor of at least short-term cellaring. Try in 2003 if you can wait that long.",Longlands,88,16.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Merlot,Te Awa Farm
65454,New Zealand,"Richly oaked and spicy, with a cinnamon-cocoa-espresso character. Earthy and dark; the black cherry flavors poke through on the spicy, peppery finish. This one could age or could fall apart, so why risk it? Drink now.",Founders Estate,88,,Hawke's Bay,,,Merlot,Selaks

65456,US,"A fine effort, brimming with bright, clean lemony fruit, as well as spiced apple, pear, and vanilla. It's light on the oak, and drinks very clean and supple, with impressive depth. Low alcohol (12.1%) keeps it light and enjoyable.",,88,12.0,Texas,Texas,,Chardonnay,Llano Estacado

65460,France,"Straddling richness and beautiful liveliness, this is going to be an impressive wine. It does need aging. At this stage, the wood is a big element, but then the bright white fruits—pears, white currants along with tangerines—will move center stage.

65461,Austria,"Bründlmayer's flagship wine, always right at the top. The fruit of this youthful 2008 is very perfumed, totally aromatic, with flavors of currants, pure steel texture and wonderful ripeness. While it shows crisp herbaceousness on the finish, it is the purity of the line that makes this wine so special. Worth aging for six years and more.",Zöbinger Heiligenstein Alte Reben,95,,Kamptal,,,Riesling,Bründlmayer
65462,US,"As rich as Napa Cab gets. Made solidly in the modern style, it's soft, elaborate and flamboyant, suggesting ultraripe blackberry pie, currant, mocha-choca and sweet oak flavors. The all-important tannins are smooth as velvet.

65463,France,"The flagship wine from Bichot's Long-Depaquit estate is, as usual, impressive. It has richness, balance, full white fruits with just a hint of steeliness.

65466,US,"This is a big, rich, dramatic Cabernet. The underlying fruit is spectacular, offering tiers of blackberries, black currants and cocoa, while 100% new French oak aging lends strong, but balanced, layers of toast.

65468,US,"A small-production barrel selection from the estate vineyard, this fine wine is brilliantly rich and balanced, proving that Napa Valley can produce excellent Chardonnay.

65469,US,"Extraordinarily rich, a tremendous Syrah from this unique vineyard in the heart of the valley.

Wonderful with spicy pork and beef dishes.",Purisima Mountain Vineyard Block 6,95,55.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Beckmen

65471,US,"Expensive, yes, but a very fine wine, showcasing what Napa Cab can do at a world-class level. But you want to cellar it, because it's all primary fruit, unintegrated oak and tannins now. Beyond the sweet cedar application you'll find deep, noble flavors of black currants and minerals, wrapped into the finest tannins imaginable. Hold until 2013,at least, and should provide good drinking for many years.",Estate,95,95.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,David Arthur

65473,US,"Don't drink this beauty too cold with your lobster, crab or scallops. It has the weight of a noble wine, with minerality and creaminess giving shape and texture to the leesy, yeasty flavors of pineapples, Key lime pie and ripe pear purée.

65474,Argentina,"Stately, stunning Malbec with alluring aromas of balsam wood, flower petals, cocoa and cola along with major league berry action.

65475,US,"If you had to choose one Zinfandel to showcase Dry Creek Valley, it's this one. The vines are said to be over 100 years of age. Just superb. Has the balance and depth of a fine Cabernet Sauvignon, but with Zin's spicy, briary, brambly personality. Erupts in wild berry, currant, cola, leather, mocha and peppery spice flavors that are so rich and deep and long-lasting. Pricey, but sets a benchmark for Zinfandel.

65476,Argentina,"Probably the best value in high-end Malbec from Argentina is Trapiche's single-vineyard series, which in 2006 was led by this bottling from an Uco Valley vineyard. It's lush, perfectly ripe and full of cola, black fruit and intensity. There's nary a chink in its fiber, and the rush of fruit that hits the palate followed by layers of subtleties is impressive.

The wine has richness though, with a tangible final burst of power.",Le Corton,94,110.0,Burgundy,Corton,,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils

But both are there, offering a concentrated wine that will develop slowly as befits its Grand Cru status.",,94,,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne,,Chardonnay,Maison Jessiaume
65479,US,"A Syrah of considerable proportions, made in the Novy style of power and ripeness. It's suprising that Novy didn't priced it higher, as it has that extractive richness and inherent wealth of texture that are the domain of expensive red wines. Just tremendous in blackberries, chocolate and spices, with the most beautiful tannins. Drink now, with the finest meats.",Parsons' Vineyard,94,29.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Novy
65480,France,"Still tasting young, with its lemon and lime flavors dominant, this is going to be a serious, mineral-driven wine.

65485,US,"A tremendous Zinfandel. Combines sheer volume of power fruit with finesse to essentially define the variety.

It's just enough to let the apple, pear and wildflower flavors dance on the palate. Good acidity helps keep things clean and balanced.

65602,US,"If the grapes were any riper, they'd be doing chin-ups in the glass. A blast of pungent peach, green apple and cantaloupe notes is accented by new oak.

65605,US,"Super-ripe grapes put their shoulder to the wheel for a highly extracted wine characterized by masses of peach and pear flavors. Oak contributes added spice, vanilla and smoke.

65613,US,"A wonderfully rich, complex and ageworthy Cabernet.

65614,US,"Freshly picked blackberries that got ripe under the hot summer sun. Lots of ground black peppercorn dust. Black currant liqueur, black licorice and even a smattering of pancetta. These are the flavors of this delicious, complex Petite Sirah. It shows the big, firm tannins the variety is famous for, but they're exceptionally ripe and fine.

65617,US,"New oak dominates this wine, with a rich eruption of toasted meringue, vanilla, burnt butter sauce and woodspice aromas and flavors, yet beneath that elaborate veneer is a wine that easily supports it. The fruit is fantastically concentrated, suggesting cherries and black raspberries baked into a pie—pie crust, and dusting of cinnamon sugar and cocoa included.

65618,US,"Buying and cellaring this expensive wine requires an act of faith, because right now, it's not showing much in the way of sophistication. It's massive in fruit, exploding on the palate with in-your-face blackberries, black currants and cherries, not to mention caramelized oak. It's almost rude. Your only choice is to age it.

65632,France,"Plenty of ripe fruit and big texture on this intense wine, which hasn't shown half its potential yet. The pear and white peach fruits are edged with minerality and a closed-in texture.

65634,US,"Chards from this vineyard always show a typicity of intensely ripe citrus and tropical fruits, backed with bracing acidity and a stony minerality.

65644,Portugal,"An exotic blend including Pinot Noir and Merlot along with Portuguese varieties, taking its name from two local villages with saint's names.

65651,US,"Youthful and herbal; the scents bring a fair amount of moist earth and bark along with the blackberry and black cherry fruits. Though it seems loaded with toasty flavors, bacon fat, vanilla and tobacco notes, the winery says it saw just 17% new oak.

65652,US,"This five-grape Bordeaux blend was aged in 65% new French oak for 20 months. Smooth and complex, this is a sharp, spicy red wine loaded with bright fruits.

65657,Argentina,"Mint and rubber band scents open the bouquet, and then black fruit and marmalade aromas take over. This Bonarda is riper, softer and more cuddly than most, with ultraripe black-fruit flavors and soft tannins that make it borderline sappy. Plump, easygoing and loaded with fruit. Drink now to get the soft, giving side of this grape.",,89,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Dante Robino

65659,Portugal,"An elegant style, the ripe fruit restrained and kept in check by the dry tannins and acidity.

65671,Italy,"The Valpantena Valley produces hearty, structured wines that are usually priced more competitively than those from the Classico zone. Bertani's Villa Arvedi is a case in point.

65678,US,"Drier, tarter and more minerally than usual, this elegant Viognier-Marsanne blend comes from a vineyard in the northern part of the Santa Lucia Highlands.

65679,Italy,"Dark tones of black cherry and raisin are immediate and upfront but are soon followed by fresh notes of blackberry, mulberry and almond amaretto.

65689,Austria,"This very spicy, new wood dominated wine, tastes initially only of toast. It's hard to find the fruit, but underneath all that wood is a lively, berry fruited wine waiting to get out. The acidity is the key—and this wine needs 2 years.",Tanzer Reserve,89,59.0,Kamptal,,,Zweigelt,Jurtschitsch

65742,New Zealand,"Black cherries, dried herbs and a hint of toast make for a flavorful mouthful. Fleshy without being soft, thanks to vibrant acidity that will cut through rich meat dishes. No tannins to speak of, so there's no need to wait before popping the cork on this one.",Winemaker's Selection,87,13.0,East Coast,,,Merlot,Corbans
65743,US,"One of those wines that smells so good, you could just sniff and swirl. There's lemongrass, vanilla, spearmint, butter and toast and a honeyed sweetness. Rich and flavorful, with melon and citrus flavors and a round, creamy texture. A slight touch of sweetness makes it fat, but it's basically a dry wine. This is a super value. Buy it by the case for your house white. Best Buy.",,87,7.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Sauvignon Blanc,Dunnewood
65744,New Zealand,"The bright cherry flavors carry a bit of toast and herb; together with a smoked-meat quality that emerges, it all makes for a complex wine. Smooth, soft tannins on the finish are complemented by juicy acids.",,87,19.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,Glazebrook
65745,New Zealand,"Hard to believe that first-crop fruit went into this wine. Peaches, honey, nuts on the nose; lime and white stone fruits on the palate. Good acidity and a bit of black pepper on the finish. Limited availability.",,87,16.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Gris,Isabel Estate
65746,New Zealand,"Aims at a northern Rhône style and succeeds, with modest oak levels and some smoky, meaty nuances. The boysenberry and blackberry fruit flavors are juicy and tart, leading into a dusty finish.",Gimblett Road,87,35.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Syrah,Trinity Hill
65747,New Zealand,"The proprietor—you guessed it, Allan Scott—doesn't like herbaceousness in Sauvignon Blanc and you can tell from the ripeness and lack of green flavors in his wine. Instead, there's mild grapefruit coupled with melon and passion fruit.",,87,15.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Allan Scott
65748,New Zealand,"Simple cherry flavors are clean, pure and easy to drink. At the suggested price of $15, this would be a Best Buy if it were available in the United States. Future vintages will be Marlborough-Hawkes Bay blends and be available in the U.S.; let's hope the quality stays at this level or even improves.",,87,,Hawke's Bay,,,Pinot Noir,Kim Crawford
65749,US,"A juicy, plump wine that's filled with fun flavors, among them blackberry, mocha, vanilla and dark candied cherries. The tannins are soft; the acidity just fine. Don't turn your nose up because of the price, or because you think Monterey and Cabernet don't mix. This is a darned good value. Best Buy.",Barrel Aged,87,10.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Château Julien
65750,US,"A likable, easy-drinking Chard that won't bust your budget, with plenty of ripe flavors and winemaker bells and whistles. It's got spicy, vanilla-accented peach aromas, and while it drinks a bit thin, it's got some class and style. The finish lasts for a pretty long time, with oaky, spicy flavors. This is a good value, especially from a top winery. Best Buy.",,87,13.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,St. Francis
65751,New Zealand,"A soft, round wine that's filled with pineapples, oranges and cream. A bit of alcoholic heat on the finish combines with spicy new oak to give it added kick, with a buttery aftertaste.",,87,23.0,Marlborough,,,Chardonnay,Palliser Estate
65752,New Zealand,"Tart and crisp, this is a fairly “green” version, boasting plenty of gooseberry and jalapeño-pepper aromas and flavors. Residual sugar is just below the typical detection threshold of 5g/L; there's enough to add weight without making the wine seem sweet.",,86,10.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Coopers Creek
65753,US,"This wine captures Pinot's silky, spicy qualities, although it's thin, light and basic. Some pretty notes of raspberry, smoke, sun-dried tomato, mushroom and chocolate and a nice, spicy intensity on the palate. The tannins are soft and light, and it snaps to a quick finish.",,86,17.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Clos du Bois
65754,New Zealand,"Fresh and light; the grapefruit and gooseberry aromas and flavors are tinged with capsicum and green peas. The residual sugar is noticeable, at 6–7 g/L, but balanced by brisk acidity.",Fall Harvest,86,10.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,House of Nobilo
65755,New Zealand,"An ideal party pour, with a slight mint-herb tang to the fresh, lemon-lime flavors. There's even a hint of toast or biscuits that adds complexity. Tart and light, this would best as an apéritif.",Voyage Special Cuvee Brut,86,10.0,Canterbury,,,Champagne Blend,Giesen
65756,New Zealand,"Toast and chocolate notes vie with bright cherry-berry fruit in this middleweight. Some herb aromas creep in, but they're dried herbs, not the offensive green variety, and they add complexity to this straightforward red.",Reserve,86,17.0,Marlborough,,,Merlot,Brancott
65757,New Zealand,"Provides a good jolt of pungent and aggressively green aromas (boxwood) balanced by sweet gooseberries and passion fruit. Representative of the “New Zealand” style of Sauvignon Blanc, this is a perfect introduction to the genre for new consumers.",,86,22.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Brancott
65758,US,"Ripe and jammy aromas, with an assortment of wild berry, chocolate and smoky notes. The flavors are ripe, full and slightly sweet.

Best Buy.",,86,10.0,California,California,California Other,Merlot,Buena Vista
65759,New Zealand,"This “Savvy” boasts textbook aromas of passion fruit, gooseberries, green peas and even a touch of mint. Supple and almost soft on the palate, it doesn't quite have the zing you expect but still manages to satisfy.",The Stones,86,13.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Cairnbrae
65760,France,"A beautifully balanced wine, its acidity blending easily with the fresh fruits, toast and rich texture. There is a high mineral content, but this fits well into the white fruits, lime zest and final freshness.",Domaine Long-Depaquit Les Clos Grand Cru,93,,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Albert Bichot
65761,US,"A very fine Chardonnay showing succulent flavors of pineapples, Meyer lemons and bracing minerals, with a rich honeysuckle and buttered toast sweetness. Flashy, impressive and an incredible value.",,93,18.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Alma Rosa
65762,France,"A big, rounded wine that brings in power, concentration and weight. Perhaps too much weight: a huge mouthful of fruit and tannins. It really needs many years to come together with all this punch and rich texture.",,93,214.0,Burgundy,Chapelle-Chambertin,,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils
65763,Austria,"It takes a while for the elegant wood to show through this broad, ripe wine. But then it brings an extra richness and vanilla creaminess. The wine is beautifully balanced, with its spice fitting well into the apple juice and green plum fruit flavors. One of the finest Chardonnays from Austria.",Tatschler,93,,Burgenland,,,Chardonnay,Kollwentz
65764,US,"Great price for a Chardonnay this rich and attactive.Although the alcohol is relatively high, the wine feels balanced, with a proper tension between ripe fruit, oak, alcohol, lees and acidity. Offers savory flavors of lemondrop candy, pineapple tart and buttered toast.",Clone 95,93,27.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Cambria
65765,France,"From Bouchard's own vineyards, this is a fine example of what is among the most renowned of Volnay's vineyards. It has much of the generosity of Volnay along with a solid core of structure, bringing plum skins, dry tannins and red berry fruits. Calls for medium-term aging as befits a lighter vintage.",Clos des Chênes Premier Cru,93,69.0,Burgundy,Volnay,,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils
65766,US,"Run, don't walk to buy up cases of this beautiful, well-priced Chardonnay. It's rich and sumptuous in vanilla oak and lees-inspired flavors of pineapples, pears and lime tart.

65768,Italy,"This is an absolutely beautiful wine made with a blend of Pinot Bianco, Chardonnay and Picolit from Friuli, in Northeast Italy. It offers harmony, extreme intensity and creamy flavors that coat clean over the palate. It's the ultimate food wine (think shellfish) but also performs without food thanks to its natural density and elegance. Not imported into the U.S.",Illivio,93,,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,White Blend,Livio Felluga
65769,US,"Seems very well made, with impressive flavors of blackberries and black currants, touched with smoky oak, and encased in firm tannins. Texture and balance are everything in these Cabs, and this wine is not lacking in either. The tannic astringency strongly suggests midterm aging, through 2013, at least.",,93,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Picazo
65770,US,"An intense, nervy Chardonnay, grown on the estate along the Silverado Trail.

65771,France,"Big and bold, this lives up to the reputation of richer Meursault. Yet crispness, a core of tight structure, toast and fresh fruits are always present. The play between the characters is delicious and likely to allow the wine to age over several years.",Genevrières Premier Cru,93,110.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Bouchard Père & Fils
65772,France,"Fine ripe fruit shows on this full-flavored wine, but there is as much of the vanilla, toast and spice character as there is of the peach note. The texture, though, is all fruit, tight apple skins with final fresh acidity.",Valmur Grand Cru,93,81.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils
65773,Argentina,"Expensive Malbec, but there's no denying its quality and class. The bouquet is super smooth and silky, but also powerful.

Sexy, alluring wine with character.",Adrianna Vineyard,93,120.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
65774,US,"A masterpiece it may be, but right now, in its precocious youth, it's all jammy fruit and smoky oak. But what jam! What oak! Tastes rich and compellingly good, like being swept away on a tidal wave of blackberry essence and cocoa. Very good, very rich, very fine, but you want to stash it away for a few years to let the parts meld.",Jack's Masterpiece,93,70.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hall
65775,US,"Made in a big, ripe style, this is Gypsy Canyon's best Pinot Noir in years, but it will require some time in the cellar to soften. It's all forward, in-your-face jammy cherries now, with brusque tannins and lots of unintegrated new, smoky oak. Give it until 2013 to begin to come around.",Trois,93,95.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Gypsy Canyon
65776,France,"Always right at the top of Faiveley's wines, this is an impressive bottle for 2007. It has weight, a seamless texture that passes from firm tannins to sweet fruit.

65777,France,"Jayer-Gilles has vines on the lower slopes of the Echézeaux vineyard, hence the subtitle of the wine, “du Dessous.” The wine has finesse, but with structure, and is impressively powered with tannins (although with a nagging green bean character as it opens up), spice, a definite amount of toast as well as freshly acid red fruits.",Echézeaux du Dessous,93,259.0,Burgundy,Echézeaux,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Jayer-Gilles
65778,France,"A broad, fat wine, showing soft white fruits and a definite amount of toast. Only towards the end does juicy acidity show through. It feels not yet fully integrated, so hold off a year.",Blanchot Grand Cru,93,70.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Simonnet-Febvre
65779,US,"A flamboyant, crisp Chardonnay made in the popular style of elaborately toasty oak and very ripe fruit, which combine to offer an almost pastry-like dessert taste.

Delicious and appealing.",Hawk Hill Vineyard,92,50.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
65780,US,"Classic Dry Creek Zin. There's a reason this warmish Sonoma region is so famous for Zinfandel, and here it is. The wine is strong and spicy and tannic, with profuse wild berry, pine cone, red currant, cherry liqueur and cola flavors, made piquant with Indian spices. Despite its exuberance, it's dry and balanced. Just lovely if you're in the mood for Zinfandel.",Old Vine,92,35.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Everett Ridge
65781,US,"This Zinfandel specialist tries its hand at Cabernet, with excellent results. With modest alcohol, the wine is thoroughly ripe, showing complex flavors of blackberries, crème de cassis, herbs and cedar. It will be fascinating to watch this Bordeaux-style wine develop over the years.",,92,22.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hobo
65782,US,"A lovely Cabernet, rich and pure and quite frankly delicious. Although it shows those famous mountain tannins, they're softly refined and entirely drinkable now, letting the blackberry, chocolate, violet and mineral flavors come through.",Lot 146,92,22.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cameron Hughes
65783,New Zealand,"Smoky and fruity upfront, reminiscent of wood-grilled white peaches, but tinged with hints of toasted hazelnut and pineapple as well.

65784,Austria,"The Zieregg vineyard is on the frontier between Austria and Slovenia. The wine, fermented in wood, is in a very tight, closed style, firm, with some bitter herbs in its youth. The flavors are of white fruits, spiced with a touch of pepper. Age for 3–4 years. Glass stopper.",Zieregg,92,,Südsteiermark,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Manfred Tement
65785,US,"This is an elaborate, oaky Chardonnay made in the popular style that has made California Chard such a success.

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Santa Barbara Winery
65786,Argentina,"Another well-polished Malbec from Trapiche's single-vineyard series. This one, from Tupungato in the Uco Valley, is the most “red” of the '06s. The fruit is juicy and bursts with acidity and power. Cherry, red plum and cassis are the lead flavors, and it finishes on a bed of chocolate and peppery spice. Good now but will benefit from another year or two in bottle.",Viña Cristina y Bibiana Coletto Single Vineyard,92,50.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trapiche

65788,US,"A very good, delicious Chardonnay that's easy to drink, and whose richness suggests shrimp, scallops, lobster and similarly rich fare.

65789,US,"Some wines taste uptown and restaurant quality just because they're so clean, balanced and complex. This blend of the two Cabernets is one of those. In its rich power, it brings to mind the wonderful 1999, although it actually costs less. Combines lush blackberry and black currant flavors with impeccably fine tannins, in a wine that should age for a good eight years.",Blair Vineyard,92,39.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,S. P. Drummer
65790,Spain,"Violet and blackberry aromas are an inviting first act, while the palate is lush and fairly deep, with thick blackberry and mildly brambly flavors.

65791,US,"The barrel influence is laid on a bit thick, but the fruit flavors mix berries, cherries and bleed into licorice, chocolate and a hint of tar.

65792,Spain,"Dark plum aromas are sweetened and softened by oak-based coconut aromas, while the color and weight are deeper and darker than average. The palate is full, ripe, semicushioned but also acidic and vital, with black fruit, mocha and coffee notes. It finishes chocolaty, with a slight herbal note.",Finca Monasterio,88,55.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Baron De Ley
65793,US,"This vineyard designate from Chelle den Millie is spicy and tart. There is medium concentration to the fruit, a mix of cassis and black cherry.

65794,Argentina,"Lively black cherry and plum aromas indicate that this slightly older wine is still vibrant and healthy.

This is a tasty, well-made, familiar style of Malbec.",,88,25.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Carmelo Patti
65795,Italy,Here's a creamy Chardonnay that epitomizes the generous style of white wine that is so popular in northeast Italy.

65797,US,"Very spicy and aromatic, this immediately stands out in the crowded field of Washington Rieslings. The ripe, tangy green fruits are wrapped in a mint/licorice candy coating; the flavors seem to gather strength and persist well into a long finish. This may not appeal to purists, but it definitely delivers a lot of clean, bracing flavor.",,88,19.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Riesling,Olsen
65798,Spain,"Not much different than the basic Sarria rosado, with maybe a touch more concentration and richness. The nose is a bit dusty, with good berry fruit notes and a whiff of cherry blossom.

65802,US,"Testarossa held back the release date for a while, but this is still a pretty tannic wine.

65804,Italy,"This is an immaculate Pinot Grigio with pristine aromas of stone fruit, white stone and honeysuckle. The wine is smooth and creamy in the mouth and begs a pairing with Tandoori chicken.

65806,Italy,"Petrussa's oak-aged Chardonnay is still drinking young and seems a bit tight and firm in the mouth.

65808,Italy,"Malpelo is a ramato-style Pinot Grigio (which means it sports a copperish color) with a cool glass closure that has done a good job of locking in the wine's fresh fragrances of citrus, rose, peach and white spice.

65810,US,"Young, fragrant, and loaded with milk chocolate and spicy berry. Tight, tannic, with grip and tang; pleasingly moderate, listed under 14% alcohol.

65813,US,"Very vibrant in acidity and bright green fruit character, suggesting limes, lychee and lemongrass. A drop of Viognier and a tiny percent of oak add softening, enriching notes.

65816,Portugal,"Bairrada's difficult grape, the Baga, needs time for aging, which is what has happened here. The result is a wine that is fragrant, not heavy, poised and fresh.

It's strong and potent, with cool-climate acidity framing mouthwatering pineapple jam, Key lime pie, kiwi fruit, white peach and vanilla cream flavors.",Highland,92,26.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Morgan
65919,US,"A first-rate Sauvignon Blanc. Bone dry and crisp and clean in mouthwatering acidity, it has wonderfully complex gooseberry, lime, grapefruit and kiwi flavors.

65920,US,"Very rich, reflecting 100% barrel fermentation in partial new oak and 100% malolactic fermentation. Under the creamy lees and buttered toast are scads of pineapples, pears and papayas. The grapes come from the Nielson Vineyard.",,92,26.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Byron
65921,Argentina,"There's no drop-off in this wine from the excellent 2005. Expect blackberry, cassis and dry balsam wood/cedar aromas. The palate is lush and chewy, but also vital and lively. Toasty, dark berry flavors get a softening of vanilla on the finish. A winner to drink now through 2013.",Catena Alta,92,55.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
65922,US,"Here's a very dry, tannic young Zinfandel that shows real depth and complexity. It has the rugged mouthfeel and spicy, peppery flavors that mark a good Dry Creek Zin. The fruit suggests wild black, blue and red berries. Drink now.",Teldeschi Vineyards Home Ranch Old Vine,92,32.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Del Carlo Winery
65923,US,"A lovely Pinot marked by crispness, complexity of fruit, and the hard-to-describe wild, feral attractions of the Sonoma Coast. With brisk tannins, the wine shows cherry, cola, pomegranate and cedar flavors, with an ineffable expression of wild thyme, sage and lavender. Drink this beautiful wine now and through 2014.",,92,48.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Heintz

65926,US,"Soft and lush and delicious, with deep, intriguing flavors of red and black berries, cherries, currants, dark chocolate and smoky cedar.

65927,US,"This is a strong, oaky, ripe Chardonnay, grown on a mountain better known for Cabernet. It's powerful and intense in pineapple tart, pear marmalade, Meyer lemon and lime flavors that have been liberally oaked, and it shows the creamy influence of lees. Not particularly subtle, it's a wine you don't want to drink too cold.",Milady,92,38.0,California,Mount Veeder,Napa,Chardonnay,Y Rousseau
65928,US,"Here's a bold, rich, powerful Syrah, marked by huge fruit. Sometimes with these fruity wines, the winemaker loses control and produces a bomb. Not here. Superb tannins corral the blackberries and cherries, and a tug of earthy leather and carob provides grounding. What a great value.",,92,19.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,Novy
65929,US,"This is a wine that's been tremendously variable over the years, but with the '07, Craig has produced his best bottling since the late 1990s.

Drink now and for the next few years.",Affinity,92,48.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Craig
65930,US,"An interesting Cabernet that shows how this venerable winery is taking the variety seriously. Dry and tannic, it shows impressively deep flavors of blackberries and black currants, with the spiciness of Dry Creek Valley reds.

65933,Argentina,"Coconut and inky black fruit melt into an ultrarich and layered bouquet, and that's the perfect entree to the wine's sweet, broad, chocolaty black fruit flavors that come with a cool mint accent.

65934,US,"Deliciously drinkable, this is one of the best California Grenaches in recent memory. Complexity is not Grenache's strong point, but lusciousness is, when the wine is well made.

Drink now.",Purisima Mountain Vineyard,92,48.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Grenache,Beckmen
65935,Argentina,"Among full-bodied, old-vines Malbec, this is an unbridled winner. The nose is rooty and sweet, but also inky and dark.

65936,France,"A solid wine, showing some generosity and richness, the fruits displaying a fine balance between sweetness, dry tannins and bright acidity.

Worth aging for several years, but already offering considerable pleasure.",Caillerets Premier Cru Ancienne Cuvée Carnot,92,89.0,Burgundy,Volnay,,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils
65937,US,"Based on Syrah, this is a distinguished, upscale blend. It's bone dry and quite tannic, with crisp Central Coast acidity, but most importantly it shows deep, intricate flavors of blackberries, currants, licorice, cola and sandalwood. A very fine release from Tolosa.",Salaal,92,42.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Red Blend,Tolosa
65938,Chile,"Probably the best-eve wine from Santa Carolina. It's rich and earthy, but also shows pure fruit and just a mild hint of fresh herbs.

65940,US,"Tightly wound, layered and lightly herbal, with nuanced flavors that show as much stone and earth as fruit. The balance is excellent and the tannins are proportionate, but don't look for the high octane, sappy fruit that comes with most Washington Syrah. This is almost steely, with tart wild berry flavors and an earthy base.",South Chapel Block Red Willow Vineyard,88,30.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Columbia Winery
65941,Italy,"You have to admire the roundness and supple softness of this Sauvignon.

65942,US,"This is a very big, extracted, extremely rich Pinot Noir. It's a bit ungainly now, like a gawky adolescent who's growing too fast. Could develop greater finesse with a year or two in cellar. The fruity flavors are ripe and fat, of cherries, currants, cola, red plums and dates. Try after 2009.",Savoy Vineyard,88,55.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Barnett
65943,Spain,"Admittedly we are tasting this later than we'd prefer, but for an '07 it is still showing vital signs and attractive aromas of sugared pastry, candied apple and lemon-lime. The palate is mostly fresh, though not as lively as it probably was nine months ago, while the flavors of 7Up and peach are refreshing. Drink immediately or wait until the 2008 arrives.",Dona Rosa,88,25.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Adega Martínez Serantes

65948,US,"Real pretty strawberry fruit shows right away. The 20% Sagemoor vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend was finished in new Hungarian oak, which does add some assertive spice.

65951,Italy,"Year after year, this is one of our favorite Chardonnays from Northeast Italy. This year, however, there is an aromatic element out of place and the wine seems unable to deliver its bouquet with the same intensity. You do get exotic fruit and toasted nut but the wine really excels in the mouth thanks to its creamy, spicy flavors.",Grafin de la Tour,88,60.0,Northeastern Italy,Collio,,Chardonnay,Villa Russiz
65952,Argentina,"Warm black-fruit aromas along with earth and controlled oak give this Malbec a nice bouquet, and the palate features full berry flavors and a dark-spice accent.

65954,Italy,"Brought to us from the distant 1999 vintage, Cialla Bianco (a blend of Ribolla Gialla, Verduzzo and Picolit) demonstrates that white wines from Northeast Italy can age.

Elegant, and a good buy at this price.",,88,18.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rued
65956,US,"This wine doesn't miss not having any oak, because the flavors are rich enough on their own.

65959,Australia,"This is a burly, firmly structured Grenache evidently meant to age, which makes it a little tough to evaluate right now.

65960,US,"A World War II–era pinup, caught mid-salute with a glass of wine in her left hand, makes this one of the more eye-catching labels to hit the shelf this year.

65961,Argentina,"One of the best Argentine value Chardonnays on the market. The nose is stylish, with butterscotch, honeyed apple and vanilla notes.

65963,US,"Lush and fragrant, and happily and distinctively not tasting like a Washington Cabernet or Merlot, this is a bowl of rose petals and ripe cherries.

65966,Italy,"Cantarutti delivers a thickly saturated and concentrated Friulano with almost passito-like aromatic intensity.

65967,US,"Cabernet Franc ripens nicely in Washington, and has built a bit of a cult following, as it is usually available in tiny quantities from tiny boutiques such as Cuillin Hills.

65968,Spain,"The “value” label from Condes de Albarei is always a good bet.

65972,Austria,"The “more” is Cabernet Franc, added, according to Hans Feiler, “in just a tiny touch.” And, although the French wood caramel and vanilla flavors are powerful, there's just enough to catch the perfume of the Cab.

65975,US,"Here's a pull out all the stops, bells and whistles Chard that aims to compete at a high level.

66083,US,"Three-plus years in the bottle have been kind to this Pinot, letting the parts meld together. The oak is knitting with the cherry, raspberry and cola fruit, resulting in a creamy-sweet mouthfeel. Very nice, and should hold over the next 4–6 years.",Estate Reserve,91,40.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Artesa
66084,France,"A ripe, open style of wine, giving white fruits, even some peach flavors, with toast and sweetness. There is weight, and a dense texture as well, the acidity lifting the finish.",Domaine Long-Depaquit Les Vaucopins Premier Cru,91,,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Albert Bichot

66086,Australia,"Because of the extreme heat of 2008, this wine does show a touch of warmth on the finish and should probably be consumed young, but there's no crime in that.

66089,France,"Well structured, balanced, giving tannins as well as acidity to balance fruit that moves in the direction of sweet plums, with hints of coffee and vanilla spice.

66090,Australia,"A hint of eucalyptus gives this wine's blackberry fruit a slightly medicinal quality, while black-olive notes provide darkness and depth.

There is considerable sediment, so decant before serving.",Alexander Munro,88,39.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,Shiraz,Meerea Park
66091,US,"Opens with the sort of sweet/tart impression that a German Kabinett might bring.

66096,Portugal,"A full, weighty, fat wine, almost new world Chardonnay in its texture and richness.

66099,US,"From Boushey and Elerding vineyards, no Washington Sangiovese could ask for a better start. This is 100% varietal, and right away it shows complexity and nuance, mixing spicy berry fruit with hints of citrus and pepper.

66100,US,"Quite an attractive white wine, for its dryness, acidity and overall balance.

66102,Germany,"Intensely diesel-like on the nose, almost to the point of nuttiness, then full-bodied, broad and muscular on the palate, delivering flavors of oranges and wet stones.

66112,US,"Marked by acidity and grapeskin bitterness, this is a Pinot Noir to stash in the cellar, in order to let everything resolve.

66114,US,"A sturdy, substantial, Rhône-inspired red. The goofy name? The winery says it refers to a Celtic people inhabiting the Rhône Valley in the days of the Roman empire.

66119,US,"Firehouse Red is Tamarack's bread-and-butter wine, and rightfully so. Though it's a mélange of Cabernet, Syrah, Merlot, Franc, Malbec and more, it pulls itself into focus with spicy, slightly high-toned fruit, bright and herbal.

66121,Argentina,"Smooth and consistent Malbec from Cafayate is what Michel Torino is all about.

66123,Argentina,"Pronounced oak is the opening blast, and amid the shy red berry and tomato leaf aromas there are hints of leather, mint and coconut. All these scents indicate that heavy wood was thrown at the wine, so while the power and goals of the wine are admirable, it's weighed down presently by a touch too much resin.

66125,Argentina,"A good finisher, with early minty, resiny aromas giving way to broader, more typical ripe aromas and flavors.

66163,France,"The most beautifully situated chateau, with its great view of the Gironde estuary, Beychevelle is another of those Médoc estates that has found top form after a fallow period in the 1980s and early '90s. The wine's generosity,  sweetness and fruit is balanced with the carefully crafted structure of wood that underpins it all. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",,93,35.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Julien,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Beychevelle
66164,France,"Managed by Jean-Hubert Delon of Léoville Las Cases, this is without equal in the Medoc appellation. It shows breeding, depth of flavor, beautifully crafted tannins and fine, rich fruit without the overripeness so characteristic of 2003. With its structure, acidity and delicious fruit, this will age as well as any wine from a more classy appellation.",,93,20.0,Bordeaux,Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Potensac
66165,France,"The most southern of the crus bourgeois estates in Margaux, the house at Siran is familiar to visitors from its pink exterior. This vintage is powerful, but still manages to exude that Margaux style and poise. There are dense tannins but they don't overwhelm, leaving fine black fruits to balance the dryness.",,93,32.0,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Siran
66166,France,"One of the stars in the world of the crus bourgeois, categorized as cru bourgeois exceptionnel in 2003, this wine is qualitatively at the level of many classed growths. Its rich fruit is punctuated with toasty new wood flavors, which should soften and balance in the next few years. An impressive wine that shows great power.",,93,33.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Haut-Marbuzet

66168,US,"This wine, with some Cabernet Franc, represents a cooler-climate interpretation of Napa Valley Cab. It possesses a juicy acidity and tight tannins that frame and gird bright cherry and blackberry flavors. Now youthful, it should hold and improve for many years. Drink now through 2015.",,93,48.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hagen Heights

66170,France,"A dark, dry, brooding wine, which has flavors of blackberries and red plum skins,  which is not at all dominated by wood. This is a classic wine, with Saint-Julien's elegance and 2003's power. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",,92,30.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Julien,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Lagrange
66171,France,"The Cuvelier family of Léoville-Poyferré owns this property. The wine shows in the dense, ripe fruit, with dusty tannins and concentration. The fruit is generous, but it has good dry tannins to give it shape as well as depth of flavor. A wine to age 10–12 years, but certainly drinkable sooner.",,92,24.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Le Crock
66172,US,"DDO's Chardonnay comes as close to white Burgundy as you will find in Oregon. Amazing finesse, with crisp, detailed aromas mixing flowers, peaches, melon and almonds.

66173,US,"This was Eric Lemelson's first planted vineyard and it's now beginning to show its stuff. Clearly Oregonian in its opening mix of leaf, root, herb and earth scents, it rounds up into some pleasing cherry/plum fruit flavors that resonate as a very pretty core of sweet fruit. Persistent and concentrated, it's still tight and compact but promises great things to come.",Chestnut Hill Vineyard,92,38.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Lemelson
66174,US,"Only 150 cases were produced of this wine. It's a lovely sipper, rich and sweet in cassis, coffee and chocolate flavors that are wrapped in smooth, velvety tannins. The fruity sweetness really kicks in mid-palate and lasts through a decadant finish.",Late Harvest Zinfandel Port,92,32.0,California,Redwood Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Zinfandel,Lolonis
66175,US,"Here's an intense, nervy wine, brilliantly acidic, layered and rich. It has enormous lemondrop, mango and pineapple flavors and lots of smoky, vanilla-accented new oaky notes, and is creamy in the mouth. The finish is long, lush and spicy. This is a real palate flatterer.",Highland Estates Camelot Highlands,92,30.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Kendall-Jackson
66176,France,"This wine manages to combine some of the delicacy and elegance of Margaux with the richness of 2003. Under the direction of Claire Villars (also of Château Ferrière classed growth), there is a confidence in this estate and its vineyards which lie adjacent to Château Margaux. Great acidity and black fruits finish the ensemble.",,92,17.0,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château la Gurgue
66177,US,"Cristom's 2003 reserve is a blend of grapes from nine different vineyards.

66178,New Zealand,"Neudorf's reign as one of NZ's top Chardonnay producers continues with this effort from its Moutere plantings. Rich melon aromas are bolstered by subtle toasty notes that are more nutty than overtly oaky, then powerful citrus fruit shines on the richly textured palate. Turns nutty again on the extended finish. Drink now–2010. The 2004 will be imported by Epic Wines.",Moutere,92,,Nelson,,,Chardonnay,Neudorf
66179,US,"Here's one mighty fine and interesting Zin. It has the smoothness of a great red wine, with a rich, fruity complexity that lasts through a long finish. The flavors are classic Zin, all wild berries and cocoa, with a dusting of raisins. The alcohol is enormous, but the wine is dry, and doesn't taste hot. With short ribs, it's a marriage made in heaven.",Grandmére,92,25.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Renwood
66180,US,"Even in the best of vintages it's hard to get Merlot to ripen in Santa Barbara unless it's grown well inland. This one does its best, with modest aromas of black-cherry fruit accentuated by oak, but there's a green weediness throughout that age will not soften. That said, it's dry and well made, and complex enough to be a nice by-the-glass wine if the price is kept down. 1,450 cases produced.",,85,18.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Merlot,Brander
66181,Italy,"Primitivo is Zinfandel, according to University of California at Davis ampelographers (students of grape DNA), but that doesn't mean they taste the same, as this medium-weight southern Italian version proves. Dark cherry, leather, coffee and cocoa predominate here, with some nice spice, tar and a slight black pepperiness (maybe that's the Zin gene) on the finish.",Winemaker's Collection Primitivo,85,9.0,Southern Italy,Puglia,,Primitivo,Canaletto
66182,US,"You might think this was a North Coast Merlot, it's so ripe and round and pleasant to drink. Not complex, but with pretty black-cherry flavors and their hint of smoky oak, it's tasty. Plus, the tannins are soft. Loses a bit for some raisiny notes, but otherwise, not bad. Best Buy.",Barrel Aged,85,10.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Merlot,Château Julien
66183,US,"Crisp, grass, mint and mild citrus aromas open this clean, fresh Sauvignon Blanc. It shows mild grapefruit flavors with medium weight, an even texture, and a lightly chalky feel. Not at all sharp or extreme. Finishes short, but brightly.",Echo Ridge,85,10.0,California,California,California Other,Sauvignon Blanc,Fetzer

66186,US,"Ripe, juicy and extra fruity, this wine is chock full of candied flavors—lemons and limes, peppermint and vanilla. Slightly sweet; probably too much for, say, mussels or clams, but ideal with fusion foods. Serve it very cold because it's a little soft.",Proprietor's Series,85,14.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Trinchero
66187,New Zealand,"Grapefruit and melon are the predominant aromas and flavors, with a few sprigs of minty green herbs tossed over the top.

66188,New Zealand,"Earl Grey tea is a classic, and its, trademark flavor of bergamot shows up in this spicy Riesling. Other flavors are pear, green apple and lime. This is a full-bodied wine that should be consumed soon.",,85,,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Omaka Springs
66189,US,"This is a simple, straightforward, everyday sort of wine, light in aroma and body, but with acceptable black-cherry, earthy flavors. It's dry and clean. 20% Syrah adds complexity and notes of currants and meat. Best Buy.",,85,10.0,California,California,California Other,Merlot,Quail Creek
66190,New Zealand,"Honey, melon, pineapple, apricot and vanilla are all prominent players on the nose of this offering. The fruit was obviously picked very ripe; add to that a caramel-vanilla suggestion of sweetness from American oak and the overall impression is almost of a dessert wine, without the sugar.",,85,15.0,Marlborough,,,Chardonnay,Cairnbrae
66191,US,"From a value leader, another rich, creamy, toasty Chard, loaded with peach, apple and pear flavors and a lot of oak. Good acidity and a long finish, but it has a little too much sugar to be considered dry.",,85,14.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Château Souverain
66192,US,"This well-known, widely-distributed wine offers round apple-toast aromas and a rich, soft mouthfeel.

It's solid and satisfying in a very mainstream manner.",Barrel Select,85,14.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Chardonnay,Fetzer
66193,US,"From Chalone's second label. A perfectly acceptable wine with lots of up-front fruity flavors and quite a bit of elegant structure for this price. It's dry, round and supple, and has a surprising edge of quality and depth. You have to hand much of the credit to the excellent vintage, which aids all wines, not just expensive ones.",,85,13.0,California,California,California Other,Merlot,Echelon
66194,US,"Starts out with aromas that are pretty typical of inexpensive California Merlots: earth, plums and blackberries, with no noticeable oak. The aromas are dull; they don't shine. The flavors are good, though. Sharply etched fruit forces itself on the palate, ripe, sweet and brimming with sunshine. This is simple, everyday stuff, but it's clean as a whistle and has a good amount of charm. Definitely a value in Merlot. Best Buy.",Vineyard Reserve,85,10.0,California,California,California Other,Merlot,Bandiera
66195,US,"From this very noble vintage comes a bottling that is softer than the Camelot bottling but no less rich and fruity. Filled with tremendous fruit flavors—apples and peaches specifically—and ultraspicy, cinnamon notes from both the grape and the oak. Made in the fashionable style, round and sweet, although it's a little flat and lacks added dimensions.",Grand Reserve,85,19.0,California,California,California Other,Chardonnay,Kendall-Jackson
66196,New Zealand,"Smells ripe, with melon and passion fruit predominating, but by the finish Marlborough's trademark green-pepper and grapefruit flavors come on strong—maybe too assertively for some tasters. Crisp and dry; a good palate refresher.",,85,15.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Jackson Estate

66198,US,"From one of the best Chardonnay regions in the state, a cool-climate wine with pronounced peach, apple and tropical fruit flavors and a blast of zesty, spicy, smoky oak. Clean and crisp, with a creamy, rich texture. Finishes with a vanilla note. The package is marred by too much sugar; consumers love sweetness, but this one takes things a little too far.",Camelot Vineyard,85,17.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Kendall-Jackson
66199,New Zealand,"Needs a bit of time to integrate all of the heavy-toast oak. Strong overtones of pain grillé and caramel currently dominate the dark fruit flavors, particularly on the finish, where fine dusty tannins linger.",Reserve,85,35.0,Martinborough,,,Pinot Noir,Te Kairanga
66200,US,"A very nice wine at a good price. Starts with a sweet fruit-oaky aroma that is warm and round. In the mouth it's soft and charming, with black-cherry and mocha flavors. Simple but satisfying, and a good value. Best Buy.",,85,7.0,California,California,California Other,Merlot,Mystic Cliffs
66201,New Zealand,"Warmer weather in Hawkes Bay means this wine shows less of the aggressively pungent grapefruit and herb aromas of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc.

66202,New Zealand,"Ohiti is a subregion of Hawkes Bay, one of New Zealand's warmer wine-growing areas, but this Chardonnay is tight and tart. Orange and lime, also tart pear flavors dominate.

66203,Chile,"Dark, with aromas of spiced plums, earth, bark, and a rich, chocolatey note. Heavy and dense, the syrupy texture carries plummy, peppery flavors through to a long, rich finish. It's a bit coarse and rough, and pretty tannic, too. Drink with well-marbled beef.",Arboleda,84,20.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Merlot,Caliterra
66204,US,"Rustic, fruity stuff here, with bold fruity-spicy flavors. A galumphing wine that's big and boisterous; nothing shy about it. A bit rough-edged, it needs meat and pasta and similarly uncomplicated foods to tame it.",Collage,84,9.0,California,California,California Other,Red Blend,Kendall-Jackson

66207,US,"A nice Chardonnay if you like really strong fruit and spice. Mouth-watering flavors of tropical fruits and super-ripe peaches, and a creamy, tangerine note that follows all the way through to the rich, slightly sweet finish. May be too big for some, but that's the style.",Radiance,84,16.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Tobin James
66208,US,"From a winery in the heart of Napa that has long been overshadowed by flashier competitors. Maybe this wine shows why. It has that Napa pedigree of fruit, but there are disturbing notes of imbalance. Some of the flavors are ripe and juicy; others are overripe and pruny, while still others are immature and green or stalky. The result is disappointing.",Reserve,84,18.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beaucanon
66209,Italy,"Quite round and fruity, this easy drinker is almost sweet. Displaying tropical fruit, honey and pear-nectar aromas and flavors, it turns warmly spicy on the finish. A simple wine, but with great potential appeal as a “transitional varietal” for drinkers moving up from jugs. Also indicates that Puglia can produce competitive everyday wines, especially if they further elevate acidity for a bit more spine.",Winemaker's collection,84,9.0,Southern Italy,Puglia,,Chardonnay,Canaletto
66210,France,"One of Bouchard's signature wines, this is beautifully textured, a series of bright fruits, strawberries and sweet acidity.

66211,US,"This is a beautiful, crisp Sauvignon Blanc, one of the best out there at this price.

66213,US,"An exotic Cabernet at a great price. Shows classically ripe Napa fruit and tannins, a big, full-bodied and dramatic wine with blackberry and black currant flavors.

66215,Austria,"A particularly rich, unctuous wine, its ripe and oily texture a foil for the lime acidity, the botrytis and the tangy honey flavors. It's an impressive full-in-the-mouth wine, worth aging for several years.",TBA,91,59.0,Neusiedlersee,,,Chardonnay-Pinot Blanc,Nittnaus Anita und Hans
66216,Argentina,"A very rich and soft wine made from hand-squeezed Malbec grapes. There's a ton of oak on it, which comes out as coconut and cream on the nose. The palate is also creamy, with mocha, sweet blackberry and fudge flavors. Cola, coconut, coffee and other hedonistic, dark, masculine accents make this a fun and interesting wine to drink now. Best on its own or with meat.",Manos,91,90.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Trapiche
66217,France,"A delicious wine that moves easily between rich, wood-aged Chardonnay and a tight mineral structure. It is ripe, with apricot flavors interspersing with pears and some orange zest. While it is ready to drink, another few months will bring out even more richness.",Chartron et Trébuchet,91,,Burgundy,Puligny-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Maison Jean-Baptiste Béjot

66219,France,"A rich wine that shows the power of Gevrey, even in a lesser vintage. The fruit fills the glass with aromas of red plums, sweet raspberries and cranberry juice. There is spice here along with juicy fresh acidity. It is worth aging 3–4 years, but is delicious now.",,91,50.0,Burgundy,Gevrey-Chambertin,,Pinot Noir,Manuel Olivier
66220,France,"Good ripe and rich wine that shows some of the opulence of Meursault. It has a good balance between toast and broad yellow and white fruit flavors. With acidity an extra component, the wine is attractively complete.",Clos des Poruzots Premier Cru,91,,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Roux Père et Fils
66221,France,"Very pure lemon and toast flavors dominate this wine. It has crispness, intense freshness and lively acidity.

66223,US,"This is a really terrific white wine, from a variety that's fast gaining traction, although few are producing it. More should.

So good and complex, and exceptionally versatile at the table.",Estate Grown Produced and Bottled,91,22.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Albariño,Cambiata
66224,Australia,"A bit reticent on the nose, showing hints of struck flint, lime and custard, but this tightly coiled Chard shows its true brilliance in the mouth, revealing complex fruit flavors of lime and lemon, but also slightly riper notes: apple and white peach come to mind. The bright core of acids shines on the long, refreshing finish. Should age comfortably through 2015, at least.",Kevin John,91,75.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Chardonnay,Cullen
66225,New Zealand,"One of New Zealand's icon Chardonnays, the 2007 version of Maté's is a smoky, bacon-scented offering, with plenty of leesy richness to go with bold pineapple and melon fruit.

66226,Argentina,"Here's a full-of-dynamite, small-batch Malbec that smells of bold berry fruit mixed with earth, smoked meats and mocha.

Only 250 cases made.",Brote Negro,91,86.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Viña Alicia
66227,US,"Tasted in a flight with far more expensive wines, this Pinot stood proud. It's dry and richly complex, with the silk-and-satin texture you want.

66229,US,"Smells bright, citrusy and clean, an impression followed in the mouth, where intricate flavors of pineapple, lemondrop candy and Key lime pie turn spicy on the finish. The acidity is brisk; the wine did not go through malolactic fermentation. Just shows that a great Chardonnay doesn't need oak, although sur lies aging gives it a notable creaminess.",Unwooded,91,27.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Cambria
66230,US,"Give this young Cabernet a good decant before you serve, because it's a big, brooding wine that needs some air to open up. Right out of the bottle, it's tannic and dry, and the blackberry and black currant flavors are buried under a blanket of astringency. But it's quite a good, well-made wine.",Lot 149,91,22.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cameron Hughes
66231,France,"This white has a touch of everything desirable. The nose is perfectly structured and classic, with bright stone fruits, white flowers and mineral underlined by a hint of ginger.

66232,New Zealand,"Rich, toasty and custardy, this is a big Chardonnay that retains a sense of balance, with a creamy texture and a powerful core of citrusy fruit that comes through on the finish.

66241,Germany,"This seems a bit simple and confected for an Erstes Gewächs offering, with superripe, fruity aromas and flavors of apple, melon and lime.

66246,US,"This dark, muscular, toasty Cabernet is infused with rich coffee/mocha flavors right up front. Cassis and black cherry provide the counterpoint, and the wine sits comfortably in the mouth, without excessive heat or weight, despite its 14.9% alcohol. The finish falls away quickly, but this is definitely a wine hankering for a thick steak.",Elerding Vineyard Double Barrel,88,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Barrage Cellars

66248,US,"Abeja's Syrah is 100% estate grown; fragrant, scented with fresh green herbs, hints of iodine, and tasting of tart fruit. It's very well-made, but not quite as ripe as would be optimal.",,88,32.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Abeja
66249,Argentina,"Good from the beginning, with deep berry aromas touched up by mocha, vanilla and road tar.

66250,US,"A rich, dry, full-bodied red wine that's a bit rustic around the edges, but lends itself perfectly to roasted meats, stews and braises.

66253,Greece,"A lush nose of mocha, cinnamon, pepper and clove starts this smooth wine with style. Flavors of cedar, spice and rich fruit are complex and delivered in a mouthfilling, structured wave.

66256,Argentina,"This unusual marriage of Pinot Noir and Malbec has a familiar set of aromas and flavors.

66268,Italy,"This is one of those awkward but deeply intellectual wines that won't appeal to everyone. Made near Gorizia, the wine shows a deep amber color with cloudy residue. Intense aromas focus on caramel, resin, candied orange peel, butterscotch and other resinous-oxidized smells. It's bold and thick and the finish is both sour and tannic.

66270,Austria,"When Silvia Heinrich, Johann Heinrich's daughter (whose name is on this bottle) pushes the alcohol up to 14%, she somehow loses the intense varietal character.

66271,Austria,"For Johann Heinrich, this wine is a celebration of Blaufränkisch. It goes back to a more rustic era in one sense, losing freshness, but gaining in depth of flavor, in structure and light wood flavors. It's worth aging for 2–3 years.",Vitikult,88,24.0,Burgenland,,,Blaufränkisch,Johann Heinrich
66272,US,"What an easy-drinking Zin, and it has real complexity, too.

66273,Austria,"Friendly and fruity, made for everyday consumption, showing spice, red cherries and a flavor of minerality that manifests itself in the acidity. Partial aging in older barrels has softened the pure intensity of the fruit, but without adding wood flavors.",,88,19.0,Burgenland,,,Zweigelt,Paul Achs

66278,Argentina,"Hard black fruit and notes of tire rubber and tar indicate that this is a dark, masculine wine. And while it does offer power, it's actually quite racy and balanced in the mouth.

66286,Germany,"Light to medium in body, this is a clean, fresh auslese, not a big, sugary blockbuster. Pineapple and honey aromas lead the way, adding green apple, mint and citrus flavors as the wine crosses the palate. To some, it may seem a bit green and underripe despite the ample residual sugar, while to others it will a welcome respite from many of the overripe ausleses that are actually declassified BAs.",Valwiger Herrenberg Auslese,88,29.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Dr. Zenzen

66288,Argentina,"After you chop your way through the black forest of char, roasted berry and coffee aromas, you'll encounter a pretty large mass of flavors that include blackberry, cola, root beer and cinnamon. It's a fairly packed and saturated wine at 14.9%, and the finish of mocha and chocolate accentuates the wine's oak elevage. Best for those who like ripeness and size. The blend is 60% Merlot and 40% Cab Sauvignon.",Calvulcura,88,25.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,Antucura
66289,US,"Kudos to the winery for picking at low brix and for keeping the residual sugar so low so that the wine is absolutely dry.

66294,Italy,"As far as Amarone goes, this version delivers general satisfaction and good quality but is also muddled by ripe flavors of strawberry comfiture, mushroom and wet soil that is probably due to overly mature fruit.

66295,US,"I'm not sure Howell Mountain is the best place for Merlot, because the dry, rugged terrain imparts strong tannins that seem weird in this supposedly gentle red variety. This 100% Merlot has big cherry, blackberry, cocoa and sweet new oak flavors wrapped in a firmly astringent, sandpapery texture. Decanting will help. So will a rich, fatty steak.",,88,75.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Merlot,Luna

66298,US,"The winery was one of the first to specialize in Cab Franc, and Premier Etage is their reserve-style bottling. The '03 is a very good wine, but misses the richness of the '01 and '02.

66325,US,"Ripe and seductive with cherries and sweet cranberries, this young, tight, stylish Pinot has nothing but clear sailing ahead.

66329,Germany,"Starts slow, gradually ramping up its complexity and concentration as it warms in the glass, eventually opening up to show scents of diesel and peach pit alongside flavors of lime, peach and melon.

66347,US,"This is a simple, soft wine with a good deal of charm. It's well made and easy to drink, with pretty black-cherry flavors that spread over the palate. The only drawback is an herbaceous quality that pervades both the aroma, where it's green and stalky, and the palate, where it's positively sharp. But at this price, these are minor quibbles.",,84,9.0,California,California,California Other,Merlot,CK Mondavi

66410,Spain,"Earthy black cherry aromas give this easygoing Rioja an honest and true nose. The palate is almost what you'd call flush, but on the other hand it's snappy and fresh, with commendable black cherry and plum flavors. With a touch of oak and mocha on the finish, it's a complete wine that should come across familiar.",Viña Zaco,87,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Bilbainas
66411,US,"With a smooth, silky texture, this Pinot has a certain appeal. The basic flavors are of ripe mashed cherries, Dr. Pepper, chocolate, anise and black pepper. One drawback is the texture, which is sharp, almost acetic. But then, it's a very young wine, and these things can resolve over time. Try sometime in 2010.",Viento Valle,87,55.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Barnett
66412,Germany,"This is a decidedly nonfruity Riesling, marked instead by aromas of petrol and featuring flavors of crushed stone, canola oil and lime.

Try it with a seafood salad or smoked trout.",Hattenheimer Wisselbrunnen Erstes Gewächs,87,,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Baron Knyphausen
66413,US,"Here's a dark, rich, somewhat heavy Pinot Noir, of the type sometimes referred to as Rhône-like.

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Carr
66414,Italy,This Sauvignon opens with a lively color and offers broad aromas of exotic fruit and white flower. It's not as intensely aromatic as you would expect but it does deliver satisfying sensations of crispness and freshness to the mouth. Pair it with spicy Thai or Indian dishes.,,87,20.0,Northeastern Italy,Venezia Giulia,,Sauvignon,Bortoluzzi
66415,Italy,"Here's a well crafted Friulano with drying mineral notes that are backed by stone fruit, grapefruit and white flower. There's good complexity, acidity and structure here and the wine leaves a satisfying peach note on the finish.",,87,20.0,Northeastern Italy,Collio,,Friulano,Livon
66416,Argentina,"Among Argentine high fliers this blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat lacks a little. The nose is mildly stemmy and herbal, while the flavors of wild berry and cranberry are a touch reedy. Tannat and Petit Verdot are not commonplace grapes, and maybe that's why the wine seems sort of herbal and edgy despite having its good qualities.",Gala 1,87,40.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Luigi Bosca

66418,Italy,"You'll like the freshness here that comes across as kiwi, grapefruit, honey and peach.

66420,Italy,"Started in the Soave region, this producer bought vineyards in Valpolicella to include hearty reds in its portfolio. In some distant way, those white winemaking techniques seem to be behind this Amarone. Its aromas are floral and soapy—wild rose and lavender—and very fragrant with undertones of scented candle or incense. The tannins are firm and the finish is long.",,88,55.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Ca' Rugate
66421,Argentina,"Touches of tree bark, nutmeg and aged cheese give the nose diversity compared to the standard blackberry and vanilla, and in the mouth the wine is full of cola, root beer and other savory flavors in addition to berry fruit. It's a bit grabby and tannic, but overall it is quite good.",Reserve,88,17.0,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,El Rosal

66424,US,"A silky, delicate, almost lightweight Pinot Noir, this is a pretty wine, the antithesis of full-bodied and lusty.

Drink now.",,88,18.0,California,Los Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dancing Bear Cellars
66425,Austria,"Thermenregion, just west of Vienna, is getting a reputation for its international varietal red wines.

66427,US,"Brisk and ripe, this Chard, from a cool region on San Luis Obispo, shows a classic profile of pure kiwi and lime fruit flavor. A layer of oak adds caramel, butterscotch and vanilla flavors.

66428,US,"Like many of Jess Jackson's high mountain Cabs, this is extremely tannic and dry, at least by Napa standards. So is it ageable? Probably, given the rich heart of blackberry, cherry, violet flower and coffee flavors. But it's a new brand, unproven. Give it until 2009, then try again.",,88,40.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pelton House

Nice with a grilled steak.",Gregory Vineyard,88,36.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,VJB
66430,Argentina,"A good effort by Cavas Weinert. The wine is starting to mature, and along the road you get ripe berry aromas that broaden and improve with time. The plum, blackberry and red apple flavors are right, as is the tannin-to-acid balance. The only complaint is a mild chemical-paint thinner note at the base of the bouquet.",,88,23.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Weinert

Drink now.",Estate,87,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Girard
66435,US,"There's a minerality to this pleasantly dry Chard, a stony tang that dominates, although you'll find pineapple underpinnings. It's a leaner, more elegant style, and the winemaker has tried to enrich it with oak, sur lie aging and 50% malolactic fermentation.",Fiorella,87,36.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
66436,US,"This is a new, reserve-style wine from veteran Ferrari-Carano. It shows its cool-climate origins in the brisk acidity that boosts well-ripened pineapple tart, green apple sauce, and Key lime pie flavors. It's also extremely oaky, and would be a better wine if it had less barrel influence.",Tré Terre,87,36.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
66437,US,"I found the winery's regular '04 disappointing. This commemorative bottling is oakier and much riper in tropical fruit flavors, with non-malolactic crisp acidity and a buttercream texture.

66442,Austria,"This is Hans Nittnaus's international wine, with Cab Sauvignon and Merlot in the blend along with St. Laurent and Zweigelt.

66451,US,"Very soft, smooth, forward and polished. Clean Pinot flavors are set off with nuances of leaf and light tea tannins. The tart fruit is braced against sharp acids, bringing out flavors of cranberry and wild raspberry.

66452,US,"This cuvée, also a blend of nine vineyards, is just slightly less rich and ripe and seductive than the lineup-leading reserve.

With crisp acidity and a creamy texture, it's dry and minerally, with interestingly rich flavors of citrus fruits, melons and pears, and a touch of smoky oak.",,90,15.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Santa Barbara Winery
66492,Austria,"A blend of Gelber and Roter Traminer from a 40-year-old vineyard. With heavily spiced aromas and a concentrated lychee flavor, the wine has a rich, gorgeous texture, all soft fruits and ripeness. It's a beautiful dry wine, a veritable perfume cabinet. Glass stopper.",Traminer,90,24.0,Burgenland,,,Traminer,Umathum
66493,France,"A big wine, with structure and fruit. The mild tannins are a counterpoint to the harmonious red berries, acidity and dense texture. Boasts a delicious, sensuous finale. For medium-term aging.",Les Damaudes,90,60.0,Burgundy,Vosne-Romanée,,Pinot Noir,Manuel Olivier
66494,US,"This is a big, ripe, full-bodied and oaky Pinot Noir. It's too powerful to drink now, unless you don't mind immaturity. The raspberry, cherry and blood orange flavors are of the pie-filling type, and the oak sticks out in smoky, vanilla sweetness. Give it 4–5 years in the cellar to come around.",Lafond Vineyard,90,48.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Lafond
66495,Chile,"One of the best values in Chilean wine is Quatro, a lusty blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Carmenère and Syrah. The nose is deep and roasted, with aromas of bacon, vanilla, pastry and black fruit. Lush and full in the mouth, with intense blackberry and cassis flavors. A titan at a great price, and ageable over the short term. Drink now through 2013.",Quatro,90,15.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Red Blend,MontGras
66496,France,"There is both weight and that ineffable Chambolle magic here, giving the wine balance, ripeness and a whisper of freshness. The possibility of aging is here, from the tannins, but the wine is already, appropriately, a charmer to drink.",Les Charmes Premier Cru,90,,Burgundy,Chambolle-Musigny,,Pinot Noir,Roux Père et Fils
66497,US,"This is a very dry, silky Pinot Noir made in a more restrained manner than some of the big, huge ones out there. It doesn't whack your head, but appeals for its elegance. Shows sophisticated cherry, sassafras and sandalwood flavors, and the price is extremely good for the quality.",,90,18.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Pedroncelli
66498,US,"This wine really flaunts its stuff (and its oak aging) in its rich, creamy body and intensely luscious profile. Aromas and flavors of buttered brioche, baked apples, butter and light smoky spice fill out the nose and mouth, with notes of sweet vanilla-infused spice lingering throughout the long finish. Oaky, sure, but well balanced and delicious, too.",Vintner's Pride,90,30.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Chardonnay,Pellegrini Vineyards
66499,US,"Run, don't walk, to find this wine. It's everything you want Pinot to be: dry, silky, racy and subtle. So easy to drink, with its polished cherry, cola, herb and pepper flavors, but complex and savory. A great food wine at an extraordinary price.",Unfltered,90,19.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Philo Ridge
66500,US,"With a touch of raisins and some heat in the finish, this is a pretty ripe Zinfandel. It's not for the faint-hearted. But it's classic California Zin, offering huge blackberry, cola, mocha and black pepper flavors that go on and on into a long finish. Demands rich fare, especially spicy, saucy barbecue.",Von Weidlich Vineyard,90,32.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
66501,Argentina,"Inky, dark, charred and serious, and it only gets better as it opens with air. The palate has a smooth, deep, comfortable feel and the flavors are sweet, fruity, creamy and proper for Malbec. Chocolaty and rich on the finish. A very nice wine made for near-term drinking.",Serie Magno,90,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Fantelli
66502,Italy,"There's a sweet note here that underlines the wine's natural aromas of apricot, honey, mature fruit and mango. There's also a touch of well-integrated spice or toast and the wine is long-lasting and extremely enjoyable overall.",Alba Nora,90,58.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Isola dei Nuraghi,,Chardonnay,Feudi della Medusa
66503,US,"Power characterizes this Bordeaux blend, which is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. It's strong in primary fruit, showcasing blackberries, black cherries, plums, carob and cola, and also strong in tannins, with a brisk, scoury mouthfeel. Add dryness, and you have a young, fresh wine of some charm and limited ageability. Now, with decanting, and through 2013.",Choreography,90,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Fleming Jenkins
66504,Austria,"Bright, deep purple in color, this is a dry, firm wine, but one suffused with sweet black berries, fresh acidity and a gorgeous juicy texture. It has a definite mineral touch to go with the vivid fruits.",Ried Oberer Wald,90,,Burgenland,,,Blaufränkisch,Ernst Triebaumer
66505,US,"The texture stands out on this dry, balanced wine. It's all velvet and silk in the mouth, almost like Pinot Noir, but everything else screams Zinfandel. The flavors are wild and exuberant, of innumerable wild berries, pepper, licorice and sweet, smoky bacon. Should develop over the next four years.",Old Vine,90,28.0,California,Fiddletown,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Easton
66506,US,"A really good Chardonnay that shows the classic acidity and dryness of the Sonoma Coast, with complex, pleasurable flavors. Pineapples, pears, apricots and guavas are the fruits, enriched with sweet oak, in a dry, balanced and elegant wine that could develop bottle nuance over the next 2–4 years.",,90,55.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fogdog
66507,US,"Shows some real class and distinction, with velvety-smooth tannins and a nice touch of smoky cedar framing well-developed flavors of black cherry candy, red currants and spices. One of the best Merlots to come out of Paso Robles lately, at a fair price.",,90,16.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Merlot,Ancient Peaks
66508,US,"Here's a deeply flavored, lusty young Zin that really shows off the variety's briary personality, even though it hails from three different counties. Very rich in blackberries, mulberries and currants, it's enormously spicy. Thoroughly enjoyable with barbecue and Mexican fare, like beef tacos.",,90,18.0,California,Mendocino-Sonoma-Amador,California Other,Zinfandel,Artezin
66509,Italy,"Here's a thick and sweet-smelling Orvieto Classico Superiore (a blend of Grechetto, Procanico and a small part of Chardonnay) that sports a deep golden color and opulent aromas of butterscotch, honey, apricot, exotic fruit and toasted nut. The wine is extremely soft and succulent in the mouth with long-lasting flavors of apricot and almond.",Pomaio Villa Monticelli,90,,Central Italy,Orvieto Classico Superiore,,White Blend,Barberani
66510,New Zealand,"Pleasant enough, but the lime and grapefruit flavors are a bit dilute. Lacks intensity overall; well chilled, the mild flavors would make a nice counterpoint to strongly flavored foods.",Winemaker's Private Bin,83,18.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Corbans
66511,US,"Has some real varietal Cabernet notes of currant and blackberry, with oaky nuances. It's supple and well-made, although of average quality, and a bit thin in the mid-palate. But it's dry and clean.",,83,8.0,California,North Coast,North Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dunnewood
66512,New Zealand,"Almost too subtle and understated, this wine's faint melon and grapefruit aromas and flavors are tinged with honey, giving a sweet-sour impression on the palate.",Reserve,83,14.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Mills Reef
66513,New Zealand,"Another N.Z. Pinot that smells better than it tastes: attractive toast, black-cherry and cola aromas give way to lean flavors of tart berries and a persistent green tannic edge that seems unlikely to fade; drink it soon.",,83,15.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Stoneleigh
66514,US,"Pleasant enough and Chard-like, with aromas of tangerine, peach and a kiss of honeyed oak. It's got enough residual sugar to almost fall into the off-dry category. Well made and certainly affordable.",,83,9.0,California,California,California Other,Chardonnay,Woodbridge

66518,US,"The cherry and smoke aromas wear an attractive olive-herb note, but the fruit could use more weight and definition. Feels like many Merlots, with its very soft, plummy mouthfeel, although the flavor range is darker, showing more blackberry and cassis. Feels a little slick or sappy, but the cassis and licorice flavors on the back end pull this beginner's Cab through.",Valley Oaks,83,13.0,California,California,California Other,Cabernet Sauvignon,Fetzer

66521,New Zealand,"No doubt a blend of Hawkes Bay and Gisborne fruit that's unfortunately lost its way in a lumberyard. It's full, indicating adequate sugar levels, but lacks fruit flavor, instead relying on wood for much of its character.",Reserve,82,15.0,North Island,,,Chardonnay,Huntaway Reserve

66524,US,"The strawberry and Play-doh—even bubble gum—aromas are actually sweeter than this wine is on the palate, where mild berry and just slightly tart rhubarb emerge.

66526,US,"Inexpensive Cabernet can often be slightly weedy, even rubbery, with a hot feeling to it. So it is with this wine. The Mondavi folks managed to pack in as much blackberry and cassis fruit as they could, but there's really just a hint of it. The tannins are light, the acidity soft, and that's about it.",,82,8.0,California,California,California Other,Cabernet Sauvignon,Woodbridge
66527,US,"The sweet grapey aromas on the nose don't mislead, but rather lead to concord-grape and pears-in-syrup flavors. A touch of spritz on the palate adds a little life, and it's at its best well chilled.",Echo Ridge,82,10.0,California,California,California Other,Johannisberg Riesling,Fetzer

66529,New Zealand,"I'll fess up—I really don't like asparagus aromas in my wine, which accounts for this wine's low score. That aside, there are some decent grapefruit and gooseberry flavors in there, and the finish is crisp and clean.",,82,16.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Nautilus
66530,US,"This Zinfandel doesn't show either the flavor or mouthfeel it should. There are some indistinct tart-berry flavors, but also a leathery element that needs more fruit to complement it. It's smooth on the palate, but ends a bit woody, and seems tired already.",Valley Oaks,81,11.0,California,California,California Other,Zinfandel,Fetzer
66531,New Zealand,"This one's an odd duck. Ripe, honeyed peach and caramelized pineapple aromas and flavors turn tart and metallic on the finish, resulting in a package that's disjointed and ultimately unsatisfying.",,81,10.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Chardonnay,Longridge
66532,New Zealand,"Ripe black cherries infused with cola on the nose, but like so many N.Z. Pinots it doesn't follow through on the palate, where elements of sur-maturité war with tart, almost astringent acidity.",,81,30.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Foxes Island
66533,US,"This blend of Nebbiolo, Sangiovese and Zinfandel starts with aromas of black raspberries, mint and oregano. While it's supple, it has a green harshness to it that dominates whatever ripe, fruity flavors it has. The result is a sharp, thin wine that leaves the palate stinging.",Arpeggio,81,15.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Red Blend,Arciero
66534,US,"Smells herbaceous and weedy, with lots of green, stalky notes and just the barest trace of berry fruit. The flavors are pretty much the same, thin and austere, with a solid dose of tannins. It's well made, but there's not a whole lot to like here.",,81,7.0,California,California,California Other,Cabernet Sauvignon,Coastal Ridge

66537,Italy,"A lush and beautiful rendition of well-oaked, new-style Chianti. Inviting dark chocolate and cherry aromas and flavors and an even, full texture mark this affordable sophisticate. The long, densely fruited finish of this exceptional value shows lots of creamy vanillin oak and tart black-cherry and espresso flavors. Perhaps hard to find, but worth the hunt. So seductive now, it will be hard to cellar for long.",,92,19.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,San Giusto a Rentennano
66538,Italy,"The black-cherry, plum and soy elements of the deep, almost profound, bouquet set you up for a serious wine. Full and powerful—but supple and even; reserved—but subtly strong, it offers up seamless black-cherry, chocolate and earth flavors.

66540,US,"From a Calistoga vineyard, this is a wine Pet fans will celebrate.

66541,Argentina,"Every llama has its day, and for Funky Llama this is one to take to the bank. The olive, leather and dry oaky aromas set the stage for solid cassis, raspberry and herb flavors.

66545,US,"A high-altitude wine from the Sonoma side of Diamond Mountain, this Syrah's main ingredient is tannin, the big, tough kind that dries out the palate. Will it age?

66555,US,"This is one of your bigger, fatter, riper Russian River Pinots, with jammy, oak-accented cherry, raspberry, root beer and vanilla flavors that are very forward and lush.

66581,Argentina,"From a global wine bottler named Xavier Flouret, this Torrontés is a full-fruited, oily specimen. The nose boasts lychee, perfume and acacia, while the palate pumps out melon and apple flavors. Big it is; precise it's not. But it's rewarding. “Flaca” may mean skinny in Spanish, but this wine is far from that.",Flaca,87,16.0,Other,Cafayate,,Torrontés,Xavier Flouret
66582,Portugal,"Literally meaning “Bordeaux soup,” this is a blend of Bordeaux varieties, including 25% Petit Verdot. It is big and powerful, with a hugely deep color, solid tannins and sweet acidity. Great juicy wafts come through the dark tannins.",Calda Bordaleza,87,38.0,Bairrada,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Campolargo
66583,Italy,"This luminous wine breaks the myth that says Pinot Grigio is not a wine of depth or personality. You'll get both here in the form of peach, nectarine, honeysuckle and orange zest. The wine is creamy, plush and slightly sweet on the close. We liked this vintage better than 2006.",,87,17.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,Pinot Grigio,Ermacora
66584,Spain,"Round, mossy and deep smelling, but austere in the mouth. A berry and plum flavor profile is infused with tomato and herbal notes, while the finish is long, healthy and cleansing. Very sturdy and Navarran in every sense because it blends juicy fruit with cool-climate typicity. Good but not for fans of sweet, bulky, superripe reds.",Crianza,87,17.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Albret
66585,Italy,There's a toasted or nutty edge to this pretty Chardonnay that plays a supporting role to peach and passion fruit.

66589,US,"Cuvaison has a good track record with their Carneros Merlot, and the '06 is a pleasant wine to drink now. It shows a balance of lush, cedar-accented currant, chocolate, anise and violet flavors with greener notes of mint and sage.",,87,33.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Merlot,Cuvaison
66590,Spain,"Pleasant but a little light on the nose, with candied fruit notes. Flavors of green melon, apple and citrus are standard fare and clean, while the feel is fresh and peachy.

66592,US,"This has retained some sweetness and is a pleasant, light take on Viognier. There are gentle notes of celery, melon and citrus, and a hint of toasted almond in the finish. A nice balance of acid and fruit keeps it on point through the finish.",SWB,87,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Viognier,Barrage Cellars
66593,Argentina,"Blackberry and plum aromas have just enough leather and horsehide accents to give this wine character.

Lively and with all the basics in the right places.",,87,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Alberti 154
66594,Argentina,"Tight on the nose, with hints of resin, lemon peel and black fruit that smell inviting when all added up.

Spunky and properly tannic.",,87,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon,Alma de los Andes
66595,Argentina,"If a Chardonnay could suffer from something called “barrel breath,” this one would. It's like a bowl full of lacquer and heady melon, and the palate is sweet, sweet, sweet. There's vanilla, marshmallow and resin along with more typical melon and citrus. A case of more being less; just too much oak and candy to rate higher.",Catena Alta,87,35.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Bodega Catena Zapata
66596,Italy,"Here's a bright Chardonnay with a clearly identifiable citric vein that slices through the chewy fruit and pulpy matter.

66600,France,The second wine of Château Margaux is certainly as good as many crus bourgeois. This vintage is ripe and elegant.

66603,Germany,"Even if it's a bit weighty, this Riesling remains balanced, thanks to intense minerality and crisp acids.

66604,US,"What a nice Pinot this is. It's not only easy to drink, it's complex in the interplay of fruit, acids and oak. There are black and red cherries, pomegranates, sweet rhubarb pie, mocha and spicebox flavors, wrapped in an elegantly silky package. The finish is deep and long.",,90,26.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacRostie
66605,US,"Pretty, spicy scents of berry and cranberry mix with sweet plum on the palate.

66606,New Zealand,"This winery's Sauvignon is reassuringly back on form following a tough 2004 vintage.

66610,US,"This fascinating wine is bone dry and tart in acids, with citrus, melon, fig and gooseberry flavors that finish with a rich spiciness. Be careful not to chill it too much.

66611,New Zealand,"This sparkling blend of 65% Chard and 35% Pinot spends a minimum of 42 months on the lees prior to disgorgement, giving it a toasty, autolytic bouquet that marries well with the crisp, clean, lemony flavors.

66614,France,"For a Médoc, this is an impressively rich wine, which maybe owes a little to the training of the technical director at Château Lynch Bages, well know for its sumptuous wines.

66621,US,"This Bordeaux blend is certainly an oaky wine. It's made in a fruit-forward style, and seems lusher, softer and more accessible than K-J's other new release, Highlands Estates Cabernets from Sonoma County.

The positive fruit-to-acid balance, solid plum and chocolate flavors and fairly big tannic finish are a find at any price. Will be even better in a year.",,91,12.0,Tuscany,Chianti Colli Fiorentini,,Sangiovese,Fattoria Le Sorgenti
66667,Italy,"The ripe, lean, smooth fruit is complemented by tobacco and cedar accents. Has a refined feel and classic tartness to the cherry flavors. Tight now, the full tannins on the finish can use a year or two to resolve, but handsome tar and licorice accents already show, and the solid components will knit themselves together well with a little time.",,90,18.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Il Palazzino
66668,Italy,"The great depth of dark cherry fruit in this suave, seamless wine is somewhat obscured now by the menthol-toast oak notes. But even now the supple mouthfeel is seductive, the blackberry and herb flavors compelling, as are the espresso and licorice notes  on the smooth, lengthy finish. Fine fruit and structure will prevail in this keeper. Cellar for two to four years.",Riserva,90,49.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Castello di Fonterutoli
66669,Italy,"Again a good melding of fruit and oak. The nose of this single-vineyard wine displays ripe cherry fruit, cinnamon and clove spice accents and a unique mint note.

66670,Italy,"A complex bouquet offers black-cherry, soy, game and anise notes, and opens nicely to an expansive palate with earth and leather notes accenting the fruit. The dark finish, with its coffee and orange-peel notes, shows some of the intrigue of the nose. Beautiful in its youth, it should get even better in a year or two. Beautiful price, too.",Riserva,90,16.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Monticello Vineyards
66671,US,"The best Mythology yet, with more lush fruit than previous vintages have possessed.

The creamy texture is a treat.",Mythology,90,28.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Merlot,Pindar Vineyards
66672,Italy,"Plum, caramel, tobacco and glove-leather aromas show fine depth. Creamy and elegant, the mouthfeel supports the black-plum fruit and toasty, earthy overtones nicely.

66673,Italy,"Quite full and very New World in style, this is a fruit and oak-loaded wine with a creamy texture.

66676,Italy,"There's lots of toast on the nose and palate of this very New Worldish Chianti, but there's no denying the appeal of the blackberry, espresso and bitter-chocolate elements. Gracefully broad-shouldered, it packs in a lot of flavor. The long, black licorice-tinged finish bears full, but smooth, tannins.

66681,Italy,"A very pleasing marriage of high-quality fruit and oak. Cloves, cocoa and licorice accent the dark plum aromas.

66685,Italy,"The Trebbiano grapes for this delicious dessert white are hung in the attic for three months in the traditional manner.

Still has plenty of acid backbone and finishes long with apricot notes.",Vin Santo,90,16.0,Tuscany,Colli della Toscana Centrale,,White Blend,Pietrafitta
66686,US,"Sure, it's made “artificially” in a commercial freezer, but so what? It tastes good. Dried apricots and honey are imbued with layers of flavor and richness.

66691,Italy,"This is a hardworking producer with a recently refurbished winery and a new tonneaux regimen that seems to have suffered from the hot vintage.

66701,US,"An inaugural vintage from an estate vineyard, and one to watch despite some structural weakness. Feels a bit rough and jagged around the edges, with a greenness to the tannins and acids.

66707,US,"The vineyard is on the Carneros border, and this Chard has lots of juicy acidity, which may also be due to the winemaker picking the grapes at a relatively low ripeness level. The pepper- and mineral-infused flavors suggest peaches and grapefruits, enriched with new oak and lees. This is an extremely dry, food-friendly wine.",Rhinefarm Vineyard,87,25.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gundlach Bundschu

66713,Argentina,"Jammy red-fruit aromas mixed with buttery oak make for a simple, sappy nose. There's more butter on the palate in addition to solid blackberry flavors.

66714,US,"Shows what is becoming the classic profile of unoaked, cool-climate Chard.

66722,Argentina,"A light but obvious blast of coconut opens things, followed by aromas of black fruit, vanilla and toast. The palate is fresh and zesty, with snappy acidity adding tang and zest to the flavors of plum, raspberry and cassis. Overall it's composed but sort of short, while the finish is medium long and ends with a dash of mocha. Seems a little on the lean side while still showing the up side of Malbec.",D.O.C.

66723,Italy,"This white blend from Northeast Italy (Ribolla Gialla, Friulano, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon and Riesling) delivers sweet floral aromas of honeysuckle, jasmine and acacia.

66728,Argentina,"Dark and full-bodied, with a big bouquet of coconut, char and blackberry.

66729,Argentina,"Dry berry fruit and spice make for a solid but very common and regular type of nose.

Nut, spice, lychee, honey and black pepper elements all vie for attention in the intense bouquet.

This distinctive white finishes long, with peach and spice notes.",Holbar,89,20.0,Northeastern Italy,Friuli Venezia Giulia,,White Blend,Marega
66832,Italy,"It's black cherries and oak galore in this rich and very dark offering. Chocolate, espresso and sour plum flavors keep on coming and the mouthfeel is big but not bulky.

Can be drunk relatively young, but certainly improves over 5–10 years.",,89,,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château d'Angludet
66917,US,"Built more along the lines of the '02 than the massive '01, this Pinot is elegant and streamlined. It's polished now in black cherry, pomegranate, rhubarb, coffee and vanilla flavors, and nice and silky, providing a complex, thoroughly satisfying Pinot experience.",Mitsuko's Vineyard,89,30.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Clos Pegase
66918,France,"This chateau, owned by one of the old Bordeaux families, the Bories, has only recently begun to gain the stature its vineyard, in the south of Pauillac, demands. This '03 is still very tight, packed with dark, tannic fruits, and dominated by a dense layer of wood. The price is still reasonable, which makes this a great wine for drinking after 10 years. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.",,89,30.0,Bordeaux,Pauillac,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Haut Batailley
66919,US,"So syrupy sweet and delicious, you almost want to pour this over a cup of vanilla ice cream. It's fabulously rich in cherry compote and milk chocolate, yet dry and backed up by crisp acids. Defines the extreme of a ripe, extracted, somewhat heavy Pinot Noir style, but there's no denying how good it tastes.",Rancho Ontiveros Vineyard,89,48.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Loring Wine Company
66920,US,"Hard on the heels of the winery's excellent 2002 comes this wine, very much in the same ripe, smooth mold. It's fresher and more youthful in tannins, but has the same blackberry, cassis, cherry and mocha flavors.",Flamenco Rojo,89,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,Martin & Weyrich
66921,New Zealand,"A bit floral on the nose, then that gives way to pear and apple fruit aromas. It's medium-bodied, nicely balancing the 7g/L residual sugar with crisp acidity that makes it appear virtually dry. Tart and appley on the finish. Imported by DC Imports LLC.",Waipara Gravels Reserve,89,18.0,Waipara,,,Riesling,Mount Cass
66922,South Africa,"A delicious wine, loaded with cassis and kirsch liqueur. The complex nose offers tobacco and menthol in addition to the deep fruit, similar to the spice and tobacco on the fruity finish. A wine to drink over the near term. Imported by 57 Main Street Wine Co.",Mill Race,89,22.0,Stellenbosch,,,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,Vergelegen
66923,US,"Distinct for its powerfully intense lemondrop and lime pie flavors, this Chard also is rich and zesty in citrusy acids. Oak plays a supporting role, bringing toast and vanilla accents. Perfect with shellfish, especially cracked crab.",,89,18.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Waterstone
66924,US,"Just this side of dry, this is a round, soft, polished Zin, rich in cherry, cassis, coffee and milk chocolate flavors, with a pleasantly spicy, peppery finish. It's a lush wine with a small percent of Syrah.",Cougar Hill,89,16.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Sobon Estate
66925,New Zealand,"Lovely on the nose, blending peppery, meaty scents with floral notes. On the palate, there's blackberry and cherry fruit, accented by black pepper. A little short on the finish, but a noteworthy effort. Imported by NZ Wine Imports.",,89,54.0,Wairarapa,,,Syrah,Schubert
66926,Chile,"This winery rarely fails with its basic Cabernet; in fact, it has establsihed the benchmark for South American value Cabs. The 2004 version is loaded with ripe berry flavors, a spot of earth and leather, and plenty of baking chocolate and tannin. Smooth and easy, but hearty and assured. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.",Reserva,89,11.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,MontGras
66927,France,"A stunning modern cellar has been constructed at this property owned by Marie-Laure Lurton. The wine has some modern polish and richness, but it is still very Margaux, showing elegant fruit to go with the ripe tannins and black  jelly flavors. This is an attractively restrained wine, which should age well over the next 5–7 years.",,89,,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château la Tour de Bessan
66928,France,"The high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon in this vineyard (65%) paid off in the ripeness of 2003. This is a powerful, very ripe wine, full of sunshine. Wood flavors support the big black fruit. If it lacks the complexity of its succeeding vintage, this 2003 makes up with its openness and generosity. Imported by France Wine.",,89,,Bordeaux,Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château les Ormes Sorbet
66929,Chile,"Solid and full-bodied, with thoroughness to the nose. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, pepper and savory spice are totally convincing, while the finish is tight and right if not exactly effusive. This Cab is made from a vineyard that houses vines planted 150 years ago, so it has some serious terroir. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Vieilles Vignes,89,20.0,Requinoa,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Château Los Boldos
66930,US,"Ripe, almost overripe, with pie-filling flavors of cherries and blackberries that veer past currants into suggestions of raisins. Feels fat, opulent, rich, heavy, and that impression is compounded by lots of toasty, sweet oak. Dramatic, but lacks subtlety and control. May develop in the bottle over the next 4–6 years.",Pisoni Vineyard,89,80.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
66931,US,"A massively fruity Zinfandel that shows how easy it is for the variety to ripen to perfection in Dry Creek Valley. Raspberries, cherries and currants flood the mouth, with notes of olive tapenade, cola, sandalwood and scads of dusty Indian spices, leading to a dry finish. It's a lusty wine to drink now.",Estate,89,37.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Talty Vineyards & Winery
66932,Argentina,"Chunky, stout and solid on the nose, with round, pure flavors of black cherry and raspberry. The mouthfeel is comfortable and complete, especially for an $11 wine from Argentina. Finishes dry, smooth and slightly spicy; very pleasing in a no-nonsense way.",Reserva,89,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Julia
66933,Chile,"Oaky at first, but then it settles into a very nice Cabernet-led wine. The palate is tight, drawing and firm, with flavors of cassis, olive and cured meats. It's complex, leathery and dry, and the oak regenerates on the finish. Savory, interesting and not some clunky, overdone fruit bomb. Drink now through 2012.",Grand Reserve,89,19.0,Maule Valley,,,Cabernet Blend,Simone
66934,Austria,"A very textured wine, with layers of taut fruit skins giving a precise structure. The wine has the brightest acidity, but also has some weight. It needs a few months to develop and deepen in character.",Leithaberg Joiser Freudshofer,89,32.0,Burgenland,,,Chardonnay,Nittnaus Anita und Hans
66935,France,"There is a good deal of wood here, the wine tasting of toasty wood as much as the fresh white fruits. It is just on the edge of too much wood, but then the crisp acidity and rounded flavors bring the wine back into balance. It really needs aging, 3–4 years.",Les Terres Blanches,89,105.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Pierre Morey
66936,France,"Light, fresh citrus aromas filled by beautiful spicy wood, with lovely crisp final character. The spice and wood add to the crisp juiciness of the wine.",,89,56.0,Burgundy,Bourgogne,,Chardonnay,Domaine Leflaive
66937,US,"Good price for a Napa Valley red of such balance and appeal. Entirely dry, with some pretty strong tannins, it wants rich meats and cheeses for balance. Mainly Zinfandel, with Petite Sirah and 10% Cabernet, which seems to add nobility. But only 475 cases were produced.",Spinning Red,89,20.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,Curveball
66938,Australia,"This medium-bodied Chardonnay is plump without being heavy, featuring modest citrus aromas but greater depth of fruit on the palate, adding pear and melon flavors to the mix. It's fresh and lively on the finish, which should serve it well with a wide variety of dishes. Drink now–2013.",Reserve Release,89,45.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,Chardonnay,De Bortoli
66939,US,"While this Cab is a little rough here and there, it's quite good, and the divots, which include some unevenly ripened fruit, are leavened with overall richness and a generosity of texture. Flatters the palate with flavors of blackberries, chocolate and sweet oak. Drink now.",,89,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hall
66940,New Zealand,"Spy Valley isn't particularly known for its Chardonnays, but this is a toasty, creamy, lush example that should turn some heads. Melon, apple, citrus and pineapple fruit is all wrapped in a cushion of oak, making for a soft, easy-drinking wine. Drink it over the next year or so.",Envoy,89,36.0,Marlborough,,,Chardonnay,Spy Valley
66941,Chile,"A classic Chilean blend that's higher in acid and red fruit character than most icon wines, but in a way that's good. The nose is composed, with a slight medicinal quality and some candied red fruit. Flavors of dried cassis, tobacco and plums are typical of “real” Chile, while a controlled confidence takes over late. Could improve over the next three years.",Le Dix de Los Vascos,89,50.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Blend,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite)
66942,Australia,"Starts with subtle smoke aromas, then folds in pineapple, lime and custard flavors.

Drink now–2012.",Sexton Vineyard,89,30.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,Chardonnay,Giant Steps
66943,Argentina,"Dry and lightly balsamic on the nose, with solid fruit aromas that show a marginal level of stem. The palate is stacked with black cherry and blueberry along with full tannins. The finish, however, is surprisingly silky, with chocolate and coconut flavors. A deep, nice, layered wine that has a lot going for it.",Alzamora,89,30.0,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,Casa Montes
66944,France,"With 54% Bourboulenc, 14% Vermentino, 16% Roussanne and 16% Grenache Blanc, here's a gorgeous Languedoc white loaded with complexity and intrigue. Notes of juicy nectarine, pineapple, melon, tangerine and pink florals dominate the nose and mouth. Balanced and creamy with a long, evolving finish that transitions seamlessly between rich, concentrated fruit flavors and brisk, clean citrus acidity.",Blanc,89,29.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Coteaux du Languedoc,,Rhône-style White Blend,Château des Karantes
66945,France,"Plenty of wood here, but also an attractive stream of red berry fruits, topped with cherries. The acidity gives good freshness, although, being a Pommard, there is a firm core of tannins that finally march with the wood.",Grands Epenots Premier Cru,89,110.0,Burgundy,Pommard,,Pinot Noir,Pierre Morey
66946,US,"A gutsy, muscular Barbera with deep, dark flavors of chocolate, blackberries, black currants, sweet leather and spices. It shows Barbera's typical acidity and tannins, and is bone dry. This is one of the better ones out there.",Pauli Ranch,89,42.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Barbera,Muscardini
66947,France,This is an expressive wine and quite powerful for a rosé. There are lovely peach and apple notes upfront while the earthy palate is enlivened by refreshing notes of orange zest. Woodsy notes on the finish suggest this wine is best drunk up before 2011.,,88,22.0,Rhône Valley,Tavel,,Rosé,E. Guigal
66948,France,"The Domaine Houchart is everything a Provence rosé should be: effusively fresh, vibrantly fruity and dry, dry, dry.

Pick this one up to enjoy a bit of the South of France with dinner tonight.",,88,12.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,,Rosé,Domaine Houchart
66949,France,"An intensely wooded wine that is dominated by dark tannins. The red berry fruit is buried under the dry spice and toast character, although at the end there is a more juicy element.",Les Molesmes Château de Rully Premier Cru,88,40.0,Burgundy,Rully,,Pinot Noir,Antonin Rodet
66950,Austria,"Furmint is essentially an Hungarian grape, but the Hungarian line is not far from Heidi Schröck's winery in Rust, and there is a long historical connection between the two countries. With ripe fruit, this is smooth, rounded, spicy, hinting at exotic fruits, with the lightest of acidity. Screwcap.",,88,17.0,Burgenland,,,Furmint,Heidi Schröck
66951,Austria,"A crisp wine that brings out bright green apple fruit flavors, the freshest acidity on top of a light texture. There is some creaminess as well, broadening out the freshness of the wine. Screwcap.",Weissburgunder,88,20.0,Wagram-Donauland,,,Weissburgunder,Josef Ehmoser
66952,France,"A solid, chunky wine that expresses the weight of Gevrey. The tannins are firm but already well integrated with the plum skin fruits. Maybe the wood element is too much, but this could soften.",,88,50.0,Burgundy,Gevrey-Chambertin,,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils
66953,France,"This wine that offers both minerality and a fresh, creamy character. It is light, with citrus and bright pear flavors finishing as fresh and crisp as they come.",,88,30.0,Burgundy,Pouilly-Fuissé,,Chardonnay,Bouchard Père & Fils
66954,US,"This is a big, powerful, ripe Cabernet, brimming with blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors. It's not shy, but bowls over the palate with potency. Not for the faint-hearted now, and should develop over the next six years.",Lot 116,88,22.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cameron Hughes
66955,Argentina,"A three-grape blend of Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot. The nose is rich and mossy, with vanilla and baked fruit aromas. It's big and tannic on the palate, and thus the sweet, semi-baked flavors of black fruit are appropriate. Sticky and tasting of brown sugar on the finish. Rich but good, especially with grilled beef.",Finca Libertad,88,21.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Benegas
66956,Chile,"A solid wine that conforms to any global standard for good New World Syrah. It's dark, rich and leathery, with a flush mouthfeel and bold flavors of wild berry and black fruits. Fresh, juicy, thick and ripe, with a dark, baked finish. Nothing fancy but really nice for Chilean Syrah.",Reserva,88,12.0,Maipo Valley,,,Syrah,Santa Rita
66957,US,"It's all in your face in this modern-style Chardonnay. Vastly ripe pineapple jam and tangerine flavors, enhanced with sweet vanilla oak and creamy lees, flood the mouth, making the wine superrich, although it's bright in citrusy acidity. Ready to drink now.",Sangiacomo Vineyard West Rows,88,32.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Signaterra Benziger

66959,New Zealand,"Of course Oyster Bay is better known for its ubiquitous Sauvignon Blanc, but the Chardonnay is a viable alternative.

66961,Italy,"Aromas of grapefruit, herb and almonds open to a mouthful of melon and peach in this medium-weight dry white.  It has a bit more texture than most Vernaccias, a clean, crisp finish and an attractive back perfume with a touch of bitter almond.",Borghetto,88,15.0,Tuscany,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,,White Blend,Pietrafitta
66962,US,"This wine is oaky; it's 100% barrel fermented and aged in new French oak for 12 months. Despite that, it's not over the top. Aromas of smoke and cured meats lead the way, then sweet pears. The texture is slick—even oily—and definitely viscous. Finishes long, with plenty of oak-imparted spice.",Sunflower,88,18.0,New York,Long Island,Long Island,Chardonnay,Pindar Vineyards
66963,Italy,"Dark fruit and menthol toast aromas set the tone, and the wine follows through in new-wave, deeply toasted style. Plum and cherry flavors, medium weight. Closes with a tart, tangy finish offering dark chocolate notes. Hold for two or three years.",Messr Pietro di Teuzzo Riserva,88,28.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Cecchi
66964,Italy,"There's a soft, almost plush mouthfeel and a creamy quality to this wine's aromas and flavors. The dark cherry fruit sports both chocolate and vanilla accents. A touch of espresso on the finish is accompanied by full but soft tannins, giving this wine the structure to age a few years.",Villa Montignana Riserva,88,23.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Coli
66965,US,"Simultaneously softer and richer than Borghese's regualr bottling, this wine shows dark berry flavors and only a touch of mint.  Some smoky notes add a meatiness that further sets this wine apart.",Hargrave Vineyard Reserve,88,22.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Cabernet Franc,Castello di Borghese
66966,Italy,"Dark and alluring, with tobacco, toast and mineral notes accenting the deep cherry fruit, this wine may not have the depth of this producer's 1996 Riserva, but is still pleasurable and more forward. Balanced and even, it's ripe and complete. Closes with interesting black tea notes and broad tannins.",Montetondo,88,13.0,Tuscany,Chianti Superiore,,Sangiovese,Castello di Monastero
66967,US,"The floral nose on this wine is textbook Franc; married to the bright cherry fruit that comes through on the palate, the result is a lighter-style, charming wine that should prove versatile with food. Dangerously gulpable.",,88,18.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Cabernet Franc,Paumanok
66968,Italy,"A traditional Chianti blend is used here, including a small proportion of white grapes, and it shows how good an inexpensive wine made well in the traditional manner can be. The ripe cherry core sports tea and spice accents, and a chalk note appears on the palate. It closes with fine tannins and a dusty rose note.",,88,10.0,Tuscany,Chianti Colli Senesi,,Sangiovese,Pietrafitta
66969,Italy,"Starts with a rich nose of dark cherry, milk chocolate and anise. It shows the typical espresso and toast flavors of the new style, but with more nuance and better balance than many others. There's a lot of oak here, but it's a very good example of the style, and should improve through 2003.",,88,17.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Villa Cafaggio
66970,Italy,"Offers aromas and flavors of cherry, cedar, licorice and menthol.

Can be held for three to five years.",,88,12.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Viticcio
66971,Italy,"This dark wine has ripe black-cherry and plum fruit complemented by cinnamon, clove and heavy-toast oak. The suavely smooth palate displays more black fruit, licorice and olive accents. Espresso and semisweet chocolate flavors accompany the dusty tannins on the long finish. Cellar for two to four years.",Riserva,88,27.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Casale dello Sparviero
66972,Italy,"A finely rendered barrique-style wine, with an elegant menthol-cedar-toast nose. Medium-weight and smooth, it displays black-cherry, chocolate and licorice flavors, and velvety tannins on the long sweet-and-sour finish. The overall profile is dark, but the fine fruit holds its own against the heavy oak. One of the few certified organic Chiantis, this tastes good now and should improve over the next two to four years.",Riserva,88,44.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Casaloste
66973,US,"Shows plenty of bright red-fruit flavors of cherry and red currants. Yes, there's a hint of green pepper, but not so much as to be objectionable.

66975,US,"The Pellegrini style seems to emphasize extraction. That's great-up to a point. In this wine, the slightly weedy cassis fruit adequately balances the starching tannins, yielding an age-worthy wine that should develop for up to 10 years.",Vintner's Pride Encore,88,29.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Pellegrini Vineyards
66976,Italy,"A solid package, offering cherry, coffee and chocolate aromas, a substantial but smooth mouthfeel and cherry flavors with licorice accents.

This can use a few years to polish its rusticity.",San Marcellino,88,30.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Rocca di Montegrossi
66977,Italy,"This unwooded Chardonnay shows a good deal more charachter than most of the Italian wines made of the grape. Pear, peach, anise and mineral aromas and flavors show considerable complexity and the texture on the long finish is quite full and almost buttery--surprising in a wine that sees no oak and no malolactic fermentation.",,88,15.0,Northeastern Italy,Collio,,Chardonnay,Marega
66978,Italy,"This wine pushes the oak regime to the max, and the cherry fruit is totally cloaked in menthol, toast and leather aromas. Beneath the veil lie black cherry, licorice and black pepper flavors, and the texture is full and supple. The very dry finish is tannic, in a manner more woody than fruity. It has style and class, but only time will show if the fruit will ever come forward. Cellar for four to six years.",Riserva,88,43.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Castello dei Rampolla
66979,US,"What a difference from Borghese's regular chardonnay.

66980,Italy,"A bouquet of bright cherries, herbs and cocoa opens this solid wine. The palate is big, with a creamy texture; tart cherry, tobacco and toast flavors prevail.

66988,Israel,"This international-style Cabernet from Israel boasts solid, full-flavored blackcurrant fruit wrapped in plenty of smoky oak. Not at all weighty, it's carried more by flavor than density or texture. The tannins are even and the finish clean and long.",,88,14.0,Galilee,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gamla
66989,US,"A sturdy wine, with a bouquet of dark cherry, cola, toast, and a touch of barnyard.  The initial flavors are sweet dried cherry, then turn toward more complex leather, sour plum and toast.  Tobacco, and a reprise of the early barnyard note, play on the finish with nice back end aromatics",,88,16.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Pinot Noir,Charles Krug
66990,US,"This bottling from Kunde is dependable for its dry, crisp elegance. It always shows bright lemongrass and gooseberry fruit, with more exotic notes of litchi and fig. The trick is to control disagreeable greenness, which pops up here in the finish.",Magnolia Lane,86,16.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Kunde
66991,France,"A semisweet Vouvray, with its honey flavors still tasting very young. The acidity is all green apple, with freshness coming from the white currant edge. Lacheteau is a négociant, based in the Muscadet region.",,86,10.0,Loire Valley,Vouvray,,Chenin Blanc,Lacheteau
66992,Argentina,"Dense, rich and encouraging on the nose, with full blackberry flavors and a flush mouthfeel. For Argentine Cab this gets it right much more than wrong. The flavors are fairly well developed and the finish has length.",,86,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sur de los Andes
66993,Argentina,"Not a bad steak or burger wine given that it offers some kicking acidity to go with sassy cherry and oak-based flavors. This is more of a forward, racy Cabernet. It doesn't lay heavily on the palate; in fact, it's a touch jumpy and staunch despite its oak cask moniker.",Oak Cask,86,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trapiche
66994,Argentina,"Having always liked this wine, which is 86% Cab and the rest Malbec and Merlot, the 2002 seems a touch bland and underwhelming.

In the mouth, it's got an Old World coarseness that turns the flavor profile to pepper and espresso. At 60% Cabernet and 40% Malbec, it's worth the price.",Dos Fincas,86,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec,Carlos Basso
67000,Italy,"This wine is a bit strange, especially on the nose where it yields too generous notes of cocoa butter, sun tanning lotion, butterscotch, cherry and sweet vanilla. The nose is definitely sweet, bordering on cloying, and tight tannins will need time to soften.",,86,40.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Farina
67001,Austria,"This Cabernet Sauvignon is rare for the Feilers. Normally the fruit goes into a blend. But in 2005, they have chosen to release a varietal Cabernet, a lean, somewhat austere wine, showing the aging potential, but also just showing some green character. Tough, with high acidity.",,86,20.0,Burgenland,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Feiler-Artinger
67002,US,"From century-old vines growing in a warm part of the valley comes this soft, layered Zin. It shows wild blue- and black-skinned berry fruits that approach raisins, rum punch, cherry liqueur and rosemary-thyme flavors.

67003,Austria,"Classic in Austrian terms means no, or very little wood, leaving the fruit to speak for itself. Black cherry fruits, pure and refreshing, suggest this could even be a summer red served chilled.",Classic,86,18.0,Neusiedlersee,,,Zweigelt,Gerhard Pittnauer
67004,Argentina,"Leather, dark fruit and citrus peel make for a good nose, while the palate is meaty and a bit heavy as it pours on those classic dark-fruit flavors that Malbec is known for. Best to get at this one now because neither the palate nor the finish shows much acidity. A touch hollow.",Reservado,86,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Viña Amalia
67005,US,"The best thing about this fine young white wine is the acidity. It's high and crisp and bracing, and makes the peach pie, honeysuckle and vanilla wafer flavors come alive. There's a honeyed sweetness, but that wonderful acidity balances it nicely.",,86,18.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Tocai Friulano,VJB
67006,Argentina,"Big and jammy, and all in all it's a solid, good Malbec. Aromas of tar and prune give way to plum and blackberry flavors. On the finish, it's a touch salty and drying, but with food it will be smoother. Good for the money, although limited in depth and complexity.",Reserva,86,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Julia
67007,US,"As much as I like this Merlot, it feels like they let it get too ripe and gave it too much oak. It was a great vintage, and the grapes ripened effortlessly. Yet there's a baked fruit, toothpicky oakiness that robs the wine of elegance.",,86,42.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Arrowood

67010,US,"The elements of great Cab are all here, from the rich, mountain-dense tannins to the gorgeously ripe blackberry, cassis and fig flavors that are enriched by lots of new, flashy oak.

67013,Argentina,"Solid, ripe and smooth on the nose, then red cherry and raspberry come forward on the zesty, tangy palate. The finish is long and healthy, but a bit monotone in its delivery.

67017,Argentina,"Finding affordable but good Cab is not an easy chore, so let this solid, smoky wine fit that bill. The nose is like a cowboy campfire, complete with hickory, leather and cured meat.

It may be slightly cooked and not for the long haul; so drink now.",Reserva,86,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Julia
67018,Argentina,"Clove and other challenging aromas greet you, and never does this blend of Malbec, Cabernet, Bonarda and Merlot get it fully together. The palate seems a little reduced and short on feel, and while it widens and softens on the finish, the ride to get there is bumpy. Expect better in 2005.",Corte B,86,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Vistalba
67019,US,"SLO has always struggled with this variety, but Wildwood seems to be getting the knack for Cabernet. Tastes like the grapes were grown in a warm area and yields were carefully limited: the flavors of blackberries plums and mocha are rich.

67022,US,"Light and touched with white pepper and fresh herb, this juicy young Barbera actually tastes like the grape; it's not just generic. Flavors combine strawberry, sour cherry and tobacco leaf; there's a residual flavor of licorice in the finish.",,87,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Barbera,Ryan Patrick
67023,Italy,"This is a lovely Sauvignon with very characteristic aromas of cut basil, capers, tomato leaf and delicate petroleum notes. The most noticeable thing is the wine's aromatic intensity that comes off in steady bursts but does so in a way that is enticing and seductive. The wine's structure is compact, yet creamier than most.",,87,18.0,Northeastern Italy,Friuli,,Sauvignon,Plozner

67027,Argentina,"Dark in color, with creamy aromas that hint at prune and chocolate. And while the wine is certainly soft and saturated, it isn't overly flabby.

67028,France,"There's no escaping the garrigue in this wine—lavender, thyme, and rosemary all dominate the nose with accents of strawberry, red cherry and chalk.

67032,Portugal,"A firm, tightly coiled and structured wine, which tastes of the granite soil of the Dão.

67035,Argentina,"Airy floral notes and a whiff of strawberry on the nose give this wine a lighter outlook, yet the palate is still fairly full-bodied as it offers ripe blackberry and chocolate flavors.

67046,US,"Spicy almost to a fault, this Cab Franc, sourced from the excellent Boushey vineyard, is structured along varietal lines, with sharp, earthy tannins, strong coffee flavors, spice and herbs in place of sweet berry flavors.

67073,France,"Meyney is often the most gentle of the great estates of Saint-Estèphe, and in 2003 this character is most obvious.

67082,US,"Smoky and meaty, with nut, white-peach and clove notes. Firm acidity allowed 100% barrel fermentation without the wine becoming overly soft.",Reserve,87,13.0,New York,Long Island,Long Island,Chardonnay,Duck Walk
67083,US,"There's plenty of toasty oak, but it only serves to accent the mixed berries and dried herbs that form the core of this juicy wine. Finishes with complex espresso, mocha and chocolate flavors that carry a slight bitter note.",,87,18.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Merlot,Corey Creek
67084,Italy,"An attractive retro label doesn't set you up for the very ripe fruit and almost Californian profile of this new-wave style Chianti. The black-cherry, vanilla and coffee flavors, soft tannins and plenty of toasty oak comprise a satisfying package. It's a stylish, appealing wine that's drinking well right now.",,87,15.0,Tuscany,Chianti,,Sangiovese,Giacomo Mori
67085,US,"A smooth, harmonious wine that carries plenty of black cherries and plums upfront, laced with coffee and mocha flavors. Good length on the finish is bolstered by a strong undercurrent of acidity.",,87,20.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Merlot,Gristina
67086,US,"This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Cabernet Franc, with 5% each Malbec and Petit Verdot is very primary, showing lots of bright cherry fruit and a judicious dose of vanilla oak. A juicy, fun wine that would make for good drinking this summer and on into fall. Bottled 9/00, release date undetermined.",Cupola,87,30.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Red Blend,Bedell
67087,Italy,"Quite fruit driven, even a touch candied, there's still much appeal in this wine's fruitcake and plum aromas and the palate's sweet-and-sour fruit with mild oak shadings. The balanced mouthfeel and easy tannins on the finish wrap up this ready-to-drink package.",,87,12.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Castellani
67088,Italy,"Plummy fruit supported by cocoa and herb notes and a decadent, overripe quality seen in no other 1998s. The ripe, supple mouthfeel provides sweet, if not overly nuanced, fruit. Finishes long, with even tannins and sweet-tart chocolate and licorice flavors. Hold a year; drink through 2006.",,87,42.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Castello di Ama
67089,Italy,"The solid dark cherry fruit here bears a heavy mantle of oak, but the fruit core is dense and can handle it. Black cherry, plum, licorice and toast work well on the full palate.

67091,Italy,"Opens with a potent bouquet of deep cherry, earth and mint. This is chewy on the palate, with solid fruit flavors, cola and clove accents and more weight than many other Chiantis. The ample fruit carries the dusty tannins and chocolate well on the finish.",,87,12.0,Tuscany,Chianti Colli Senesi,,Sangiovese,La Lastra
67092,US,"This wine is so big, lush and soft on the palate that you can almost overlook the strong herbal aromas that mark the bouquet. Black cherries and chocolate complete the package.",,87,24.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Cabernet Franc,Schneider
67093,Italy,"A mildly gamy, slightly sauvage note adds interest to this well-oaked wine. Cherry, cinnamon-toast and menthol aromas open to a palate of deep cherry fruit with earthy accents. The feel is supple, and black-cherry and licorice notes show on the long, smoothly tannic finish. The toasty oak and fruit work in harmony here.",,87,21.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Vecchie Terre di Montefili
67094,Italy,"Deep berry aromas accented by chocolate and multiple spices provide an inviting opening to this sturdy wine. The mouthfeel is full, and here the wine shows a much toastier, oak-driven profile than suggested by the bouquet. Lots of charcoal, licorice and earth flavors follow on the long, evenly tannic finish.",,87,23.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Riecine
67095,Italy,"After some sulfur blows off, dark cherry aromas with leather accents come forward.

67097,US,"At over five years of age, this wine still boasts an impressively saturated purple color and dense, rich black-fruit aromas. There's plenty of oak, too. But the tannins are dry and hard; this wine's future development is unclear. Impressive more than pleasurable, and might always stay that way.",,87,35.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pellegrini Vineyards
67098,Italy,"Dark is the word here, with lots of deep toast, licorice, chocolate and coffee notes throughout. The pleasurable mouthfeel has nice weight and the finish offers solid cherry and cocoa notes and good length. This wine has some tannins to lose and can be cellared for a year or two.",,87,18.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,San Fabiano Calcinaia
67099,US,"Weedy, with some bell pepper and herb aromas, cassis and tobacco. Elegantly lean and graceful in the mouth, the wine ends in a long, spicy finish.

67100,Italy,"This smooth, balanced offering shows plenty of cherry, leather and cedar flavors. The round mouthfeel and the licorice and toast flavors on the palate are wrapped around ripe, almost candied fruit. Oak is present but there's enough fruit to support it. A likeable wine to drink now.",,87,15.0,Tuscany,Chianti Superiore,,Sangiovese,Burchino
67101,Italy,"This medium weight wine shows complex dark plum, toast, tar and cocoa notes, but there is also a decidedly sauvage element, and this gamy note won't appeal to all tasters. Dense black-cherry, plum and licorice flavors, brisk acidity and full, ripe tannins round out the package. Has impressive qualities, but also controversial ones. Cellar until 2005.",Tenute Marchese Antinori Riserva,87,38.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Antinori
67102,Italy,"A bouquet of saddle leather, cherry and rhubarb opens to a richly textured palate of sour cherries and dry spice accents. The sprightly, tannic finish offers notes of tart cherry and leather in this solid offering. Drinking well now; can hold through 2005.",Villa Antinori Riserva,87,21.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Antinori
67103,Italy,"Opaque and ultra toasty, this very international-style Chianti has “black” aromas and flavors, nice texture and a long espresso-and-dark-chocolate finish. It's solid, but really reads deep only in one dimension—the heavy oak regime. Pleasurable, but one has to wonder if the fruit will ever really shine through the woody veil.",Poggio delle Rose Riserva,87,63.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Castell'In Villa
67104,Italy,"The aromas and flavors of black cherry, raspberry, cocoa and toast are ripe and full in this medium-weight offering.

Drinks well now, will be better in one or two years.",,87,15.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Castello d'Albola
67105,Italy,"Rustic in a positive sense, this medium-weight, supple wine shows dark cherry fruit once a touch of sulfur blows off. Finishes long, with black-cherry, licorice and espresso flavors. It could use a year to even out and integrate its parts.",,87,12.0,Tuscany,Chianti Colli Fiorentini,,Sangiovese,Lanciola
67106,Italy,"The tart berry and plum fruit wears a good dose of cocoa on the nose and picks up nice herb and licorice shadings on the smooth medium weight palate. Finishes long and dry with dusty tannins, and pronounced herb and mineral notes.",,87,14.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Le Bocce
67107,US,"Ripe and buttery, this reserve Chard from winemaker Eric Fry could hardly be more different from his White Label bottling.

67109,Italy,"Very big and dark, the deep cherry fruit here is cloaked—some might say overshadowed—by the intensity of the oak. Still, it possesses a stylish, suave quality and a good mouthfeel, even if it loses some typicity in the robe of international-style toast. Will be better in two or three years.",Croce Riserva,87,25.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Terrabianca
67110,Chile,"Angular on the nose, with earthy, semisharp red fruit aromas that are undoubtedly Pinot-related.

Dry, toasty and endearing on the finish.",Alpha,88,24.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Pinot Noir,Montes

67112,Chile,"Earthy and warm, and very much requiring time to open and show itself. So don't freak out if upon opening it's tight, funky and odd. Later it will become a serious wine with cheek-pounding berry fruit, a rock-hard structure and power all the way through the toasty finish. Don't be looking for refined elegance or you'll be left at the station. Drink now through 2013.",Cordillera Reserva Privada Cariñena-Merlot-Shiraz,88,23.0,Central Valley,,,Red Blend,Miguel Torres
67113,Chile,"Earthy and damp at first, then come cool cola and olive aromas that announce the Carmenère in the lead. The palate is rugged but true, with smoothness from the Merlot and then full olive and herbal flavors. Stays on track from front to back; there isn't a lot of variation to the wine.",Cordillera Reserva Privada Carmenère-Merlot-Petit Verdot,88,23.0,Central Valley,,,Red Blend,Miguel Torres
67114,US,"A rich, balanced and lovely Sauvignon Blanc. Fermented in stainless steel tanks, it's clean and crisp, with vibrant flavors of lemons, limes, vanilla, honeysuckle and spice. Sur lies aging adds a desirable texture of cream.",Jardine,88,16.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Vina Robles

67116,US,"Not much oak is evident in this polished Chardonnay. What stars is fruit, all pineapples, pears, tangerines, green apples and papayas, and the acidity that makes it all bright and clean. Great with pasta in a butter sauce with garlic and pepper.",,88,18.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Egret
67117,Australia,"This Chardonnay from a Shiraz specialist features ample weight without any oak treatment, leaving the bold pear, melon and pineapple flavors unblemished. It's crisp enough to cleanse the palate, yet plump enough to pair with a variety of dishes.",Unoaked,88,15.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Chardonnay,Elderton
67118,Chile,"The yellow color and doughnutty, honeyed aromas give it away: this is barrel-fermented, Bordeaux-style SB. The nose is barrique heaven, but the vanilla and resin qualities are stylish. Creamy but balanced in the mouth, with flavors of oak, vanilla, spice, honey and baked apple. Smooth stuff but very oaky, and not for everyone.",Hacienda Araucano Humo Blanco,88,22.0,Lolol Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,François Lurton
67119,France,"An interesting blend of 50% Chardonnay, 40% Roussanne and 10% Sauvignon Blanc, this is a lively and very aromatic white with scents of pretty pink florals like sweet pea and roses, ripe peach, mango and melon. The same carries through to the palate, which shows great roundness in the middle without being too flabby. The finish is clean but lengthy. Delish.",1 C,88,15.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Vin de Pays de L'Herault,,White Blend,Chateau Capion

67121,US,"Albariño is one of those new white wine varieties that's creating such interest.

67122,New Zealand,"Zesty and refreshing, the 2007 Coddington comes across as just slightly narrower and tarter than its stablemates. Hints of toast and vanilla accent bright starfruit and apple flavors.",Coddington,88,42.0,Kumeu,,,Chardonnay,Kumeu River
67123,Argentina,"Strong and extracted, and needing a few minutes to settle. The palate is concentrated, dark and chewy, with ripe berry flavors that hint at being medicinal and raisiny but don't fully go there. While this is nothing earth-shattering, for $12 it's complete and should offer mass appeal.",,88,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lamadrid
67124,US,"Extravagantly rich, showcasing ripe, forward flavors of cherries baked into a pie, Dr. Pepper cola and sweet, smoky oak, with all kinds of peppery Indian spices.

67125,Chile,"A huge improvement from the overoaked, flawed 2007 Sibaris. This is still toasty and resiny like most Chilean Chards, but it's also smooth and thorough in the mouth, with orange, melon, vanilla and toast flavors. Unfolds nicely on the finish; very good for Maipo Chardonnay and, as stated, a far more balanced wine than the previous vintage.",Sibaris Reserva Especial,88,15.0,Maipo Valley,,,Chardonnay,Undurraga
67126,France,"Broad, ripe, full in the mouth, packed with soft white fruits and an open structure. There is some wood, the vanilla melding easily into the fruit. For drinking now.",Les Chaniots Premier Cru,88,27.0,Burgundy,Montagny,,Chardonnay,Vignerons de Buxy

67128,France,"A soft, open wine, giving wood and yellow fruit flavors followed by light acidity. The initial effect is somewhat dilute, but the wine does show more fruit character as it opens up.",Les Charmes,88,,Burgundy,Chassagne-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Roux Père et Fils
67129,Italy,"This is a fresh and luminous blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Cortese that really hits home thanks to its frank approach and pristine aromas of citrus, stone fruit and honey. The wine is crisp and slightly sweet with an attractively creamy texture. Four lions symbolize four winemaking families of Piedmont.",Vino Bianco,88,17.0,Piedmont,Monferrato,,White Blend,Quattro Leoni
67130,Argentina,"Earthy, spicy and rich on the nose, but then quite gritty, tough and tannic on the palate.

Solid as a rock, warm, baked and sweet.",Grand Reserve Pasionado,88,50.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Andeluna
67131,New Zealand,"Lovely aromas of toasted nuts and lemon curd are backed up on the palate by hints of melon and citrus.

Drink it over the next 6–12 months.",Single Vineyard,88,30.0,Martinborough,,,Chardonnay,Alana Estate
67132,France,"Bouchard's village wines express the nature of each place well. None more so than this firmly tannic Nuits-Saint-Georges.

67136,France,"A wine that reflects the relative lightness of the reds in this vintage. It has a layer of tannins, but they don't suggest aging; they are more a base for the attractive raspberry and red plum flavor, freshened by the acidity.",Marconnets Premier Cru,88,50.0,Burgundy,Beaune,,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils
67137,US,"A lovely Zinfandel, dry and elegant and balanced. Yet it preserves Zin's briary, brambly character, with wild berry, currant, cola and pepper flavors. Really savory and a delight to drink.",Cool Climate Vineyards,88,20.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach

67139,France,"The Domaines Ott Chateau de Selle is a breed apart, with little of the effusive red fruit that we typically associate with Provence Rosés. The 2008 shows vanilla and butterscotch aromas that lead to a serious, medium-weight palate with good flavor intensity. Winds up on a lingering note of newly-mown hay. Drink now.",Château de Selle,88,42.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,,Rosé,Domaines Ott
67140,Australia,"Shows some nice complexity, marrying earthy undertones with tart berry fruit and peppered meat, but comes across as crisp—verging on lean—before falling away on the finish. A bit European, or at least cooler-climate, in style.",,87,30.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Shiraz,Koonowla
67141,Italy,"Here's a sophisticated and layered expression of Sauvignon with creamy aromas of peach, mango and creamy vanilla custard.

67144,Argentina,"Solid, basic Malbec with plenty of fruit and power. The palate is plump, mildly oaked and tastes of honest plum and blackberry.

67145,Argentina,"Tight, rubbery and smoky at first, and then it shows more vanilla and sweet berry fruit after it has opened up. The mouthfeel is nice and fulfilling, while the flavors of black fruit, nutmeg and mild toast are pleasing. Nothing too exotic or out of the ordinary here. Just good red wine at a good price.",,87,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Septima
67146,Argentina,"Mostly it's clean and neutral smelling, but there is a bit of candle wax and peach to the nose as well.

67149,Argentina,"Ripe, healthy and pure, with familiar aromas and flavors of cassis and berries. In the mouth, it's bright and lively, with plenty of acidity but no sheering, harsh qualities.

67151,Italy,"This is a super-intense wine that might not appeal to everyone. The aromas are wide reaching, immediate and recall almond Amaretto, candied orange, brown sugar and molasses. The wine is chewy and soft in the mouth and leaves strong marzipan flavors and a playful touch of sweetness.",,87,19.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,Friulano,Antico Broilo
67152,Argentina,"A little jammy and heavy at first, but airing gives it better focus. The palate runs full and lush, with sweet tannins running alongside blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors.

67153,US,"Dry and tannic in youth, with a jammy, somewhat heavy mouthfeel, this wine, from a sub-appellation in Lodi, might benefit from a year or two in the bottle.

Drink soon.",Heintz Ranch,87,28.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutch Bill Creek
67163,Spain,"A solid, earthy style of Navarran red wine, with plum, berry and meaty aromas. The palate is forward, with solid flavors of tobacco, plum, tomato and leather.

Not currently imported.",Malón de Echaide Crianza,87,,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Tempranillo Blend,Bodega del Romero
67164,Spain,"Dried fruit, a touch of compost and then bold coffee and mocha aromas give the wine a decent nose, and the palate, while zesty and snappy, is endowed with pretty good raspberry, cherry and strawberry flavors.

67169,Italy,"There's a fragrant component to the nose that recalls jasmine, honeysuckle and exotic fruit with a distant shading of crushed white pepper at the back.

67170,Argentina,"A veneer of oak and aromas of root beer greet you, while cherry and raspberry flavors work the palate. It's a lively, tannic wine with a candied, slightly resiny/minty flavor profile and finish. Best with food.",Estate,85,16.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Doña Paula
67171,Argentina,"Plum, blackberry and other fruit aromas work the nose, which is light and airy more than deep and concentrated.

67176,Argentina,"Mocha, coffee and other oak-based aromas are front and center on the nose. The palate is quite sweet and rich, with cola and dark fruit flavors.

67183,Argentina,"Don't let the bright purple color and plum/prune aromas fool you: the wine looks deeper and fleshier than it is.

67188,Argentina,"Good out of the blocks, with full and creamy berry aromas. The palate doesn't exactly follow that lead as it shows slightly tart red cherry and cranberry flavors.

67192,US,"The wine was half cool-fermented in steel, half in neutral barrels, a nice combination that lets the pure fruit flavors star, while juicing them with a tiny boost of smoke.

Sweet wood and cherry aromas play out on the fairly tannic finish. Good now, better in a year, but you have to have a taste for wood.",Arcano,87,12.0,Tuscany,Chianti Colli Senesi,,Sangiovese,Cecchi
67254,Italy,"Plum and anise surround the berry fruit in the bouquet of this stylish medium-weight bottling. There's a slightly chalky feel to the palate. Cherries, with more anise notes and a dry finish of powdery tannins, close this attractive value. Best now through 2002.",Riserva,87,10.0,Tuscany,Chianti,,Sangiovese,Renzo Masi
67255,Italy,"A slightly muted nose of dark cherry and toast offers hints of rose and tar. Similar flavors play on the palate with a touch of chocolate and a smooth mouthfeel. Long and dry, the espresso-tinged finish is elegant. The depth of fruit can be sensed and this should open up with short-term cellaring, displaying more depth and richness in a year's time.",Riserva,87,14.0,Tuscany,Chianti Colli Senesi,,Sangiovese,Vagnoni
67256,US,"Faint smoke notes accent the crisp blackberry fruit. Not a lush wine, but it has just enough flesh to prevent it from being hard. The finish is tart and peppery, as befits cool-climate Syrah.",,87,25.0,New York,Long Island,Long Island,Syrah,Pindar Vineyards
67257,US,"Aromas of smoke and toast over black cherries and mocha, with some dried-herb accents. Full-flavored, but the mouth-drying tannins require cellaring, and only time will tell if this wine will ever come into balance.",,87,17.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Merlot,Pellegrini Vineyards
67258,US,"Toasty, perhaps a little overly toasty, with lots of menthol notes. Still, there's an attractive nuttiness to the wine and solid pear and white-peach fruit.",Brick Kiln,86,17.0,New York,Long Island,Long Island,Chardonnay,Channing Daughters
67259,US,"Shows good varietal character in its bouquet of roses, ripe pears and lychees. As far as dessert wines go, this is a lightweight, at only 6% residual sugar, but it's certainly flavorful enough. Low acidity suggests it should be drunk over the short term. The only quibble is a shorter than expected finish.",Aphrodite Late Harvest,86,15.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Gewürztraminer,Duck Walk
67260,France,"The deep color and viscous, almost oily texture attest to the high level of concentration in this wine. Unusually, the nose is more mineral than fruit, while some cinnamon flavors peek through in the mouth. Soft acidity and high residual sugar suggest it should be consumed all by its lovely self.",Kessler Grand Cru,88,34.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Domaines Schlumberger
67261,US,"A deeply flavored, smooth Cabernet with the balance and elegance to drink with fine fare. It feels rich and plush, with aggressive tannins that frame ripe flavors of black cherries, red currants, cola, herbs and oak. Could even age for 2-4 years, although beyond that is a gamble.",,88,29.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Egret
67262,France,"A fascinating nose, with grapefruit, kiwi, citrus, orange rind and hay that fold in to a peach/pear structure in the mouth. Very light and almost austere on the finish, this is a Riesling that would be at home at a raw bar. Drink now to 2012.",Cuvée Henri,88,30.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Lucien Albrecht
67263,France,Luscious and weighty with good varietal character. Lychee and spiced pear dominate upfront while the flavorful palate exhibits honey and nutmeg. Notes of baked apple pie hang around for quite a while. The spiciness and slight sweetness call for a Thai curry dish.,Cuvée Marie,88,30.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Lucien Albrecht

67266,Argentina,"A chunky, deep-fruited Malbec that is all about blackberry fruit.

Emphasizes size and friendliness.",,88,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Kaiken
67267,Chile,"A pricey Syrah by Chilean standards, but at least it's a good wine. The nose offers cookie, violet, wet clay and herbal olive notes along with black fruit aromas, while the palate is packed with sweet roasted berry and dark plum flavors.

67270,Argentina,"Smoky and floral on the nose, and then thick and ripe in the mouth, with syrup to go with medicinal berry flavors.

67271,Italy,"Here is an oak-aged Chardonnay with overtones of toast, vanilla and roasted almond that sit squarely besides well-integrated notes of exotic fruit, honey and apricot.

67273,Chile,"This could just as easily be labeled Cabernet because Cab is 90% of the blend. Regardless, it's a textbook version of a basic but likable Chilean Cabernet with currant and berry aromas. Ripe, composed and tasting of cassis and black cherry. Dry and clean on the finish, with all the basics in place.",Gran Devoción,88,15.0,Maule Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,Viña Maipo
67274,Chile,"Savory and a step up compared to the rest of Chile's under-$15 Malbecs. This wine has complexity and character; it smells a little like Syrah but in the mouth it's as full, cuddly and friendly as any Malbec from Argentina or elsewhere. Saturated, fruity and fun to drink, with a spot of heat and char on the finish.",Reserva,88,14.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Malbec,Viu Manent

67281,France,"Fashioned in the gutsy Ehrhart house style, this example does not disappoint, opening with intense Chinese spice and ground coriander which yield to cut apple and nutmeg flavors on the palate.

67296,US,"This is Elerding vineyard fruit and it has some good, juicy flavor upon entry.

67341,US,"From a winery that names their wines after hummingbirds comes this Merlot. Hard to imagine a red wine getting fruitier and still remaining technically dry.

67342,Italy,"You either like it or you don't and I am not a fan: The wine is so sweet it drinks more like a Recioto dessert wine than an Amarone; it closes with biting astringency, making it nearly impossible to pair with food.

67345,US,"Although there's lots to like in this Zin, it's just too sweet. On the plus side are rich, complex flavors of cherry pie, raspberry tart, cassis, cocoa and mushu plum sauce, accented by peppery spices and a bit of wood. Also nice are the dense but ripe tannins.

67434,France,"Serious mineral tones take precedence over the fruit here, with hay aromas giving way to flavors of stones and just a hint of apricot on the palate.

67521,France,"An easy, attractive wine that shows some of the very ripe, small berry flavors of 2003.

67522,France,"With 44% of Cabernet Sauvignon and an equal amount of Merlot, this wine perfectly expresses the relatively cool vineyards of Listrac.

67523,US,"This opens with tart, tight leaf and beetroot flavors, which overlay quite soft, round and riper fruit. The integration of earthy tannins with the fruit is a little disjointed; what shows most clearly are the leafy, herbal plant flavors. There's plenty of stuffing here; perhaps this is one of those wines that will warrant a higher score with additional bottle age.",Grand Cuvée,87,49.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Belle Vallée
67524,US,"This single-vineyard bottling is riper and more intense than Brander's regular '04 Cab, but it's not necessarily a better wine. The angular tannins are more pronounced, giving it a jagged, sharp mouthfeel that will not age away.",Vogelzang Vineyard,87,30.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Brander
67525,US,"Tough, dry and tannic, with an unrelieved quality, this is a wine that needs serious time in the cellar or major decanting to let it soften.

Cohn

67527,New Zealand,"This is a dark, ripe expression of Syrah, with coffee and blackberry scents that pick up molasses, cola and black pepper notes on the palate.

67529,New Zealand,"An interesting contrast to many of the other Hawke's Bay Syrahs, this one features red raspberries, white pepper and hints of rhubarb.

67535,Italy,"Very dark plum and toasty oak aromas, deep espresso flavors, and a dense chewy texture are the hallmarks of this wine. Displays good structure: moderate acidity and ripe tannins.

67558,Italy,"The sour cherry fruit and cedar accents here are in balance, right down the middle of the divide between the old and new styles.

67560,Italy,"Here's a cheerful white blend from Tuscany (with S.

67573,Argentina,"Dark and a little baked on the nose, with prune, fig and earthy aromas. The palate is a bit hard and reduced, with pounding tannins, but the fruit is equally big and ripe, so it all seems to be correct. Mellow on the finish, with a hint of chocolate.

67585,US,"Shows the crisp acidity and bright minerality that characterize so many whites from this coastal Mendocino appellation.

67593,Argentina,"Not a bad value. The wine is a touch reduced and short on mouthfeel and aromatics, but it still delivers creamy vanilla flavors, raspberry essence and decent density.

67617,Argentina,"Warm, earthy, leathery and grapy, with a mildly tart, underdeveloped palate that offsets any roughness with a blanket of creamy oak resulting in flavors of berries and milk chocolate. With more focus, riper fruit and less oak, this wine could better.",Antá Reserve,84,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Telteca
67618,Argentina,"Almost sugar-beet sweet on the nose, with a good dose of oak and size. The palate is expectedly big, but with fairly hard tannins and limited depth of fruit.

67622,Argentina,"Black Label is a step up the quality ladder for Las Moras, based in San Juan. And this wine is full and chunky on the nose, with blackberry and plum-based aromas. In the mouth, it's more racy and oaky, teetering on sharp. But the freshness it boasts bodes well for pairing with meat, and the aforementioned oak lends a hint of cappuccino to an otherwise snappy finish.",Black Label,86,18.0,Other,San Juan,,Bonarda,Las Moras
67623,Argentina,"Interesting enough on the nose, with aromas of cotton candy, charcoal, lemon peel and coffee.

67633,US,"Ripeness wasn't the problem in 2007. The wine shows solid berry, cherry, currant and cola flavors, with a rich array of spices, and the texture is silky and attractive.

67707,Italy,"There's berry and rhubarb-like aromas and dried cherry flavors that have hints of tobacco, vanilla and leather.

67742,Australia,"This medium-bodied Pinot Noir features pronounced herbal and spice elements that may not find universal acclaim.

67753,Spain,"Initially it smells a bit cheesy and drawn, but with time it evolves to show plum, raspberry and tire rubber aromas. In the mouth, it's tight, fresh and a little gritty, with red-fruit flavors of cherry and raspberry. Not overly generous in terms of mouthfeel, but it does push the fruit until the final bell. More of a food wine than a solo sipper.",Reserva,86,12.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Tempranillo Blend,Malumbres
67754,Argentina,"Saucy and sulfuric at first, but better with time. The palate amounts to a saturated fruit bomb with grip, while the core flavors of cassis and black fruits are very sweet and chunky. Bulky, broad and on the cusp of syrupy.

Drink right away to catch its vitality.",Don David Reserve,86,16.0,Other,Cafayate,,Chardonnay,Michel Torino

Well done but nothing unusual.",Reserva,86,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Montecillo

67796,Argentina,"Big and colorful, with soupy aromas blended with a waft of heavy berries. The palate is packed with anonymous red fruits, but the mouthfeel is pretty hard and miserly. Tastes reasonably good but has little in common with Spanish Tempranillo.",Finca la Daniela,83,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Tempranillo,Bodega Familia Barberis

67798,US,Pet fans will like it. Fans of delicacy and elegance may shake their heads at the alcohol level—early 16%—and almost Port-like flavors. But the wine is fully dry.,Rodney's Vineyard,83,30.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Petite Sirah,Epiphany
67799,US,"Rose petals and leathery spice on the nose are intriguing, while the palate combines red fruit and assertive tannins. Pepper and spice give it a dry edge but the finish has a nice touch of tobacco and cherry.",,83,22.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Syrah,Macari
67800,Italy,"Possesses some decent black-cherry aromas and flavors with leathery, earthy accents, but also a sour streak and a sulfurous note that refused to yield. The wine finishes dry, with some of the astringency shown by many 1998s.",,84,11.0,Tuscany,Chianti Colli Senesi,,Sangiovese,Gattavecchi

67802,US,Crisp pear and citrus fruit gets almost aggressively tart in this stainless-steel fermented Chard. Good length; should pair well with oysters on the half-shell.,Scuttlehole,84,13.0,New York,Long Island,Long Island,Chardonnay,Channing Daughters
67803,Italy,"The strong start—a nose full of slightly candied cherries, plums, cloves, prunes and cinnamon—is a great setup, but the expected richness does not materialize on the palate. Rather it's a bit lean and tart and the wood overpowers the fruit, which oddly seems to be fading already.",Pratale,84,19.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Coli
67804,US,"The dominant aromas are smoke, toast, and cinnamon, which ride over tart-cherry fruit.  Turns quite stemmy and tough on the finish.

67806,Chile,"This Chilean wine displays two personalities. The nose offers aromas of ripe peaches and cream, with honey and buttered-toast accents. On the tongue it turns crisp and tart, with citrus and green-apple flavors and fairly sharp acidity. It finishes short and bright.",,84,8.0,Maule Valley,,,Chardonnay,Alfasi
67807,Italy,"Light berry aromas carry smoke and cedar accents. The mouthfeel is even and dry, and tart cherry and cocoa flavors carry from the palate through the moderate finish. A good quaff in a lighter style.",,84,10.0,Tuscany,Chianti Colli Fiorentini,,Sangiovese,Le Torri
67808,Italy,"After an unusual, almost saline note passed, this wine presented a bouquet of dark cherry, chocolate and toast.

67809,US,Tart green-apple flavors are joined on the palate by a touch of fresh berries. Clean and crisp; a good summertime wine that's the local version of a Provençal rosé (but made from a blend of Chardonnay and Merlot).,,84,11.0,New York,Long Island,Long Island,Rosé,Wölffer

67811,Israel,"Round and fairly full, this is mainstream juice in the international style, with ripe apple-citrus fruit and lots of smoky, vanilla-tinged oak. It's a straightforward crowd-pleaser that could say Coastal, but it's from the Galilee, in northern Israel.",,84,12.0,Galilee,,,Chardonnay,Gamla
67812,US,"With 20% barrel fermentation, this wine is surprisingly rich and spicy for a low-end Chard. The aromas and flavors bring to mind pears and golden-delicious apples, before turning tart on the finish.",Peacock,84,9.0,New York,Long Island,Long Island,Chardonnay,Pindar Vineyards
67813,US,"The aromas bring to mind buttered cashews and pears poached in vanilla syrup. The flavors follow suit, in a medium-bodied wine that's soft and easy to drink but tails off a bit on the finish.",Festival,84,10.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Chardonnay,Paumanok
67814,Italy,"The elements of cherry, mint and cedar on the nose show a touch of age, and the dry cherry fruit on the palate seems to vie with wood for prominence. Overall it's quite angular, but does show some attractive earthy notes and a chalky element on the finish.",Riserva,84,18.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Querceto
67815,Italy,"The light cherry aromas and flavors with herb accents show a slight candied quality. Decent structure, but overall the wine is a bit narrow and closes with sharp, quite tart cherry fruit. It's youthful, for sure, and perhaps will even out with six to nine months in the bottle.",Aziano,84,15.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Ruffino
67816,Italy,"Opens with an appealing bouquet of dark cherry and chocolate, cedar and leather accents. In the mouth simple berry flavors sporting wood and leather accents take over. Finishes with tart cherry notes and moderate length.",,84,11.0,Tuscany,Chianti Colli Aretini,,Sangiovese,Vasari
67817,Italy,"The juicy berry fruit on the nose carries a green herb element. While smooth in texture, the black cherry flavors of the palate seem a touch sharp and underripe. A touch of leather and caramel picks up the finish.",,84,7.0,Tuscany,Chianti,,Sangiovese,VinArte

67819,Italy,"A medium-weight contender whose fruit struggles to be acknowledged above the oak.

67822,France,"Once the sulfur note blows off this young wine, the tart berry and cherry aromas and flavors wear cocoa and tobacco accents.

67825,France,"So light, dry and taut, you might mistake this for a Sauvignon Blanc with its grapefruit profile and high acidity. Still, the cleansing tartness is likeable, if not entirely expected. This will work as an apéritif or paired with lighter foods.",,84,8.0,Loire Valley,Vin de Pays du Jardin de la France,,Chardonnay,Herzog Selection
67826,US,"A solid effort for North Fork Cabernet, which has a tendency towards inconsistency. This has dark cassis fruit underlined by a weedy, herbal streak and a dried-fruit nuance as well.",,84,20.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gristina
67827,Israel,"Aromas of sweet red berries, dried fruits and herbs open this light, accessible wine from Israel. The tone of the fruit seems to shift between a tart rhubarb and a slightly candied quality. Cherry notes show on the lean and dry back end.",Private Collection,84,12.0,Judean Hills,,,Merlot,Carmel
67828,US,"Loaded with new oak, which in this case means it's cedary and very mentholly,  Under that is some tobacco and coffee.  Very drying tannins clamp down on the finish.",Reserve,84,19.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pindar Vineyards
67829,US,"Very floral aromatics mark this distinctive effort; it's positively overflowing with rose petals. Turns more musky and spicy in the mouth, before fading away a little abruptly.",,84,15.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Gewürztraminer,Palmer
67830,France,"A very soft, ripe and open wine that lacks structure. The best aspects are the finely judged wood element and the light acidity that floats at the end.",,87,,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Roux Père et Fils
67831,Italy,"Creamy and smooth with a dense and sophisticated style, this is the kind of top-shelf Pinot Grigio you could pair with lobster bisque or New England clam chowder. There are pretty aromas here of yellow flower, acacia, peach, pear and citrus.",,87,24.0,Northeastern Italy,Collio,,Pinot Grigio,Russiz Superiore
67832,Argentina,"Floral aromas lead the show, backed by meatiness, minerality and wild sage and thyme aromas. The palate is fresh and young, with edgy but saturated plum and raspberry flavors. Turns more narrow and simple with time, but for a basic Malbec it more than gets the job done.",Trumpeter,87,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Rutini
67833,Chile,"Sweet, a bit candied and creamy on the nose, with marshmallow and other oak-driven aromas. The palate has a common, regular, comfortable feel as well as vanilla and boysenberry flavors.

67834,Chile,"Earthy and foresty on the nose, with balsam wood aromas that go well with hints of grilled meats and spice.

Easy to like and good for the money.",Reserva,87,12.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Agustinos
67835,US,"Direct and bold in cherries, raspberries, chocolate and spices, this is a tasty Syrah. The richness is wrapped into fine, sweet tannins, with a tweet of smoky oak. Drink now.",Parmelee-Hill Vineyard,87,30.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Atmosphere

67837,US,"Good and rich, but a bit ungainly. Sharpness makes it tart, and the oak stands out, shoving the cherry, currant, plum and cola flavors aside. These may be the marks of an immature wine, but it is very difficult to forecast this Pinot's future. On the assumption that balance now equals balance later, it's probably not an ager.",,87,35.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fogdog
67838,US,"A nicely balanced wine with ample fruit flavors of soft peach and honeydew backed by hints of soft sweet spice and toast.

67841,Italy,"Here's a dark pink, almost red rosé (from oak-aged Syrah grapes) with aromas of wild berry, forest floor and bitter almond.

67842,US,"Shows a huge, welcome improvement over the '06.

Lohr
67843,US,"Doesn't seem to have much, if any, oak on it, but it doesn't matter, because the underlying wine is so good, at such a nice price. Crisp and steely, it shows rich flavors of pineapples, apricots, tangerines and pears.",L de Lyeth,87,13.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lyeth
67844,France,"Here's a great Sauv Blanc sure to please on warm, sunny days. Prominent but not overdone tropical fruit notes play with soft peony and citrus on the nose and mouth.

67845,US,"Not quite up to the wonderful 2005. A bit too fruity and oaky, flooding the mouth with blackberries, cherries, currants, chocolate and sweet caramelized wood, but lacking a certain depth and complexity. What a difference a vintage can make.",,87,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mirror
67846,Argentina,"Multifaceted on the nose, with aromas of horse saddle and mulch that give way to cleaner floral and berry liqueur scents.

Chewy, with a coffee-like essence to the finish.",Reserva,87,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,François Lurton
67847,US,"Tastes dry and sharp in acids, a young, tart wine not offering much pleasure now, despite good cherry, cola, red licorice and sandalwood flavors. Needs a little time, but not too much. Give it a year to calm down.",SRH,87,28.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Lafond
67848,US,"The underlying wine is very good, showing brisk acidity, a cool-climate minerality and long hangtime, ripe flavors of pineapples, crisp green apples, mangoes and limes. Yet the oak is heavy-handed, overwhelming the fruit with caramel, and making the finish too sweet.",,87,48.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Heintz
67849,Chile,"With its toasty nose of baked apples and popcorn, the wine gives off a barrely welcome. The palate is a touch resiny in feel, but it's stout and solid, with tropical flavors of pineapple and melon. Falls a little flat on the finish as banana notes enter the fray. Drink now.",Clava,87,12.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Quintay
67850,US,"This earthy Meritage is a standout of the Virginia wine scene. The nose is suave and subtle, dominated by notes of forest floor, strawberry and espresso.

67852,US,"With no oak, there's nothing but bright, searing acidity and pure, intense flavors of limes and kiwis in this dry Chardonnay. There's an undertow of minerals, like the tang of cold steel. A very clean and pure expression of Edna Valley terroir.",No Oak,87,19.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Tolosa
67853,US,"Somewhat sharp and angular in the mouth, but other than that, a pretty good glass of Syrah.

67858,Argentina,"Black cherry and a light floral perfume get this generic Cab going in the right direction. The palate is healthy but not heavy, while the flavors of red berries and currants are tasty but anonymous to the point that it's hard to identify the wine as Cabernet Sauvignon.

67860,US,"Although it's less pricey than the winery's Encell Pinot, I slightly prefer this one for its accessibility.

67862,New Zealand,"Not explosively aromatic, but that may make this Gewürz easier to warm up to for some consumers.

Imported by Cordon Selections.",Moutere,87,24.0,Nelson,,,Gewürztraminer,Kahurangi

67864,South Africa,"Dark red in color, this Bordeaux blend offers sexy aromas of chocolate and cigar box, and has earthy flavors of forest floor, tobacco with a nice spice.

67868,US,"A very nice blend, midway between a reserve and a single vineyard wine. The “Cuvée” series from Rex Hill is designed to express the nuances of several of the newest AVAs and sub-AVAs in the state. This excellent bottle is soft and approachable, with pretty fruit.

67889,US,"With a touch of raisins in the finish, this is a nice example of a Foothills Zin. It's ripe, alcoholic, dry and rich, with Zinny flavors wrapped in sturdy but accessible tannins. There's a long finish of black cherries and cocoa.",Old Vine,86,20.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Renwood
67890,US,"Tastes pretty much like Carr's other 2007 Pinots, only oakier. The woody flavors give a heaviness to the underlying blackberries, cherries, currants and pepper spice. Drink over the next few years.",777,86,60.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Carr
67891,France,"With 70% Syrah and 30% Grenache, this wine exhibits loads of red fruit character: raspberries strawberry, red currant and rhubarb all make an appearance backed by accents of garrigue herbaceousness. Good acidity and light tannins makes this an easy go-to for barbecue chicken or pork.",Cuvée Fernand Averoux,86,19.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Minervois,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine Sainte Léocadie
67892,Italy,"Here's an easygoing white wine from northeast Italy with measured aromas of citrus, melon, honey and stone fruit.

67894,Australia,"The Adelaide Hills are an up-and-coming cool-climate region of South Australia, and home to some of the country's best Chardonnays.

67895,US,"A bit rugged and rustic in the mouth, but dry and very ripe, with chocolate-infused blackberry pie, mushu plum sauce and cedar flavors. The blend is Cab, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah.",Director's Cut Cinema,86,30.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Francis Ford Coppola
67896,Argentina,"Dark, robust and slightly medicinal, with a bouquet that's not run of the mill. The palate is juicy and jacked up on acidity, so we find live-wire cassis, berry and chocolate flavors that aren't quite as integrated as they should be. And it finishes slightly hot and sticky. Expensive for a wine that's all over the map.",Edicion Limitada,86,32.0,Other,San Juan,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Aguma
67897,France,"Light brick color with a delicate nose of barely ripe strawberry, thyme, tomato leaf and a tinge of licorice.

67902,Italy,"This luminous Pinot Grigio opens with simple aromas of stone fruit, melon and citrus and delivers fine levels of acidity and enough structure to carry forward with fish pasta or risotto. The wine performs nicely in the mouth thanks to its creamy texture.",,86,20.0,Northeastern Italy,Collio,,Pinot Grigio,Vidussi
67903,Italy,"There's a playful candy-like element to the nose that recalls butterscotch, caramel or honey drops. Beyond those aromas are citrus, stone fruit and melon.

67905,Argentina,"It's been many years since we've reviewed a Q Cabernet from Zuccardi, and this one is typically oaky, with plum, raisin, rubber, pepper and roasted fruit on the nose. The palate is tannic and firm, with meaty, grabby berry flavors offset by mocha, vanilla, caramel and other wood-driven flavors. Good wine but it comes with some bite and burn.",Q,86,22.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Zuccardi
67906,Argentina,"Large and ripe on the nose, with rubber, leather and rusticity. The palate is juicy and quick, with medium-weight tannins that frame lively cherry and blackberry flavors.

67907,Argentina,"Septima's first crack at making a big wine leaves us intrigued but not thrilled. This is dark, meaty, saturated and most of all heavily oaked. It smells like coconut and veneer, while the rich, bulky palate is packed with resin, vanilla, cinnamon and blackberry. The blend is Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tannat, and it could stand to be more refined and balanced than it is.",Gran Reserva,86,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Septima
67908,Argentina,"After starting out somewhat murky and muddled, it gets to better footing. The palate is thick and meaty, with sweet, semibaked fruit flavors and a handful of carob nibs.

67909,US,"This 100% varietal bottling is the first release for this Mirage vineyard designate. Some interesting floral highlights to this wine; the fruit has light flavors of boysenberry and blackberry. Flavors are mostly all up front, without much depth or specific varietal character, but it's pleasant enough. Just a little chalky in the finish.",Mirage Vineyard,86,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Basel Cellars
67910,US,"A bit heavy and soft, like a Starbucks mocha drink infused with blackberry essence, then sprinkled with cocoa powder, cinnamon and pepper. High alcohol adds a chile pepper burn on the finish. Needs grilled meats and rich cheeses to balance it out.",Jack's Cabin Vineyard,86,35.0,California,Rockpile,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bella Vetta
67911,US,"Even though the alcohol level is moderate, this Pinot tastes hot, like a jalapeño chile pepper.

67912,Italy,"This resinous Ribolla Gialla offers thick aromas of candied fruit, dried apricot, pinesap and maple syrup.

Best for those who like their reds big and rich.",Edicion Limitada,86,32.0,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,Aguma

67919,France,"Starts off with a slight medicinal note that blows off after some time in the glass, which then allows the cherry, red berry and menthol notes to shine through. Moderate acidity with soft, approachable tannins makes this a perfect session wine for drinking with friends.",Generations,86,20.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Languedoc,,Syrah,Laurent Miquel
67920,Austria,"With its pretty girl label, this is not intended to be serious. The Zweigelt is attractive, soft, with good berry flavors.

67921,Argentina,"Once you cut through the heavy, minty oak, there's a decent wine hiding in the folds. The body carries reasonably ripe black cherry and raspberry flavors as well as plenty of wood-generated tannin, but does it taste much like Syrah? I find it more generic and woody than varietal.  Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",Select,83,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Trivento

67924,Argentina,"This colorful, clumsy wine shows glaring powdered-drink and candied cherry aromas and flavors, and while it's kind of scouring and rough it manages to make its mark via its juicy ripeness.

67930,Argentina,"Holds it together for the most part, but this isn't what you'd call a focused or interesting wine. The nose is mildly fruity, while the palate is shapeless and doesn't deliver recognizable Chard flavors.

67931,Argentina,"Mildly grassy and dilute on the nose, with sweet, candied berry flavors and a sticky, woody finish. It's fairly full in the mouth, but it lacks the precision, darkness and focus of a top-flight Malbec.",,83,16.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Kono Barú
67932,US,"Ballentine continues to struggle with this bottling. It's more balanced than the '02, but still has a harsh, baked quality to the cherry-berry fruit. That accentuates the tannins, which feel hard and astringent.",Pocai Vineyard,83,22.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Ballentine

67934,Argentina,"Most of Bousquet's wines are enigmatic. They show some good qualities but also signs of overcropping and underripeness. That said, this wine is typical: it's scattershot in its delivery of green-infused berry fruit, tannins and wood. It's O.K. but never settles down.

67936,Argentina,"Can't say that the heavy dose of oak on this wine is helping the cause.

67939,US,"Really not a very likeable Syrah despite some tasty cherry fruit flavors. The problem is enormously high alcohol, 15.9%, that makes the wine hot, and a near absence of acidity, which makes it cloying. The imbalance makes the tannins astringent.",F Block Rodney's Vineyard,82,45.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,Epiphany

67955,Italy,"The red cherry fruit bears some mushroom notes among the cedar and clove accents, and there's a sense of hollowing-out that should not be evidenced at this age.

67956,Italy,"As much as we like the retro package, this time the contents are just too one-dimensional.

68080,US,"An awkward wine. High alcohol can work in Zin, but not in this one.

68144,US,"Compare this with the winery's 2005 bottling (they were co-released for some reason), and you get a good example of vintage variation.

68156,US,"A little more tannic, dry and robust than your typically soft, cult-style Napa Cab. You could call it old-fashioned, with its blackberry and cedar flavors and brisk structure.

68163,New Zealand,"This is 100% barrel-fermented, which has left its mark on the wine. There's some crisp apple and citrus fruit flavors, but toast and butter notes play the starring role.

68170,US,"From up in the Chalone highlands comes this very dry, acidic and rather earthy Chard. It has peach and apricot flavors, with a touch of green tea and tannins. Seems like it has the structure to age, although that has got to be considered a gamble.",Brosseau Vineyard,86,40.0,California,Chalone,Central Coast,Chardonnay,A Donkey and Goat
68171,New Zealand,"Slightly nutty and leesy on the nose, followed by a medium-bodied, peach and orange-flavored midpalate. Turns very citrusy and tight on the finish, much like some Hunter Valley Sémillons. Not imported in the U.S.",Distinction,86,16.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Sémillon,Kemblefield
68172,US,"The overwhelming impression is of strong, astringently dry tannins that absolutely limit pleasure. Is it worth cellaring? There's a deep core of black cherry and cassis fruit and adequate acidity. The wine will undoubtedly throw sediment and soften, but that doesn't equate to improvement. Your best bet is to decant and drink with rich, fatty meats and cheeses.",Reserve,86,46.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Geyser Peak
68173,US,"This simple Chard has likeable, intense flavors of lemons and limes and other tropical fruits, such as guavas and nectarines. It's very dry, and the finish is rich in clean, bright, palate-stimulating acids.",,86,14.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Hahn
68174,US,"The touch of Porty, chocolate-covered raisins doesn't dominate, instead providing an extra layer of flavor to the blackberries and cherries of this dry, substantial wine. It's a rich example of Sierra Foothills Zin, with its high alcohol and sun-ripened fruit.",Jack Rabbit Flat,86,30.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Renwood
68175,US,"A blend of Bordeaux and Rhône varieties, this is a dry, somewhat rugged wine, whose best feature is fruit.

There's a tannic, acidic streak that makes it a little tough, though.",Tytanium,86,39.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,Ty Caton
68176,Chile,"Plum, raisin and a bit of bramble/leather make for a fairly classy nose. And given that this wine is relatively inexpensive, what you get on the bouquet and the palate is admirable. The flavor profile deals juicy raspberry and plum, with chocolate shadings. Easy and persistent on the fruity finish. Imported by Laird & Company.",,86,7.0,Central Valley,,,Merlot,Valdivieso
68177,Chile,"Good from the start, with an aromatic mix of black olive, berry and cherry. The palate offers more of the same: cherry, plum and pimiento.

68190,US,"First bottle corked. Second bottle sound, but rather one dimensional. The fruit is simple green apple and green berry; but there is a distinct earthy undertone that carries into the finish.

68191,Italy,"A drying mineral note appears in the foreground and helps create a neutral, less aromatic first impression.

68192,Argentina,"A big step up from previous failures, this vintage shows tropical fruit aromas and some sea breeze. The flavors are of pineapple and tangerine, and the acidity is nice. On the finish, the fruit holds and the feel is right. Drink soon to capture the wine's perky freshness.",,85,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sauvignon Blanc,Carlos Basso
68193,Argentina,"Lots of red-fruit aromas send it out in familiar fashion, while the palate runs a bit zesty and acidic. This is not as soft and rich as in the past; the flavors rest on bright plum and cherry fruit with plenty of acidic kick. Solid but regular as Malbec goes, and probably in need of food to give the acids something to work on.",,85,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alamos
68194,Italy,"Extremely vertical and direct, this luminous Sauvignon delivers intense aromas of chopped herbs, exotic fruit and citrus.

It's simple but ready to go.",,85,30.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Merlot,Northwest Totem Cellars
68198,Argentina,"Opens with sweet berry aromas that are inviting yet generic. The palate has plenty of acidity, making this Merlot food-friendly but racy on its own.

68199,Italy,"This is an easygoing and tonic Sauvignon with textbook aromas of exotic fruit, wild flowers and basil leaf.

68201,US,"You'll find strong flavors of grilled blackberries and black cherries, tobacco, unsweetened baker's chocolate and black pepper in this dry, tannic wine.

68204,US,"100% Merlot from Hedges North Block on Red Mountain. It's light, spicy and simple, without the muscle and verve of the state's best Merlots.

68206,Argentina,"Cherry and plum aromas carry the mildest touch of stem, yet the palate is reasonably stocky.

A creamy and flavorful finish makes this well worth the money.",Alta,85,9.0,Other,Tulum Valley,,Malbec,Callia

68208,Argentina,"Light, semisweet aromas of cherry show a modest level of concentration, while the palate is a bit rubbery and delivers good but regular cola and cassis flavors.

Only 250 cases made.",Gemela Reserva,85,20.0,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca Santa Justina
68209,Italy,"Here's a flatter, perhaps more neutral expression of the fragrant Sauvignon variety that offers citrus-like zest in the mouth and tonic aromas of exotic fruit, papaya and mango.

68216,Argentina,"Sweet, candied and ever so slightly green on the nose, with generic but fairly solid cassis and berry flavors coming next.

68219,Argentina,"A gamy, slightly stemmy and rubbery style of Bonarda that reflects the variety, Mendoza's terroir and the vineyard. Which doesn't mean that it's great; far from it, the wine is good but stemmy, with green-ish notes and reedy accents infiltrating the red-fruit flavors that control the palate. Solid and structured, but still it leaves something to be desired.",Estela Armando Vineyard,85,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,La Posta

68223,Argentina,"This variety doesn't seem to have adapted well to Patagonia. For starters, it has virtually no inherent Sauvignon Blanc character: it's oaky, sour and scratchy, with a lean and watery finish.

68231,Argentina,"It's hard to understand why Santa Julia would want to make an oaked Pinot Grigio in Mendoza, but they did. And we find it as odd and difficult to get through as you might expect.

68237,France,"Dense and rich but also incredibly complex, long and elegant, this is a momumental Côte-Rôtie. It's darkly fruited and superripe, yet doesn't lose its essential sense of terroir, remaining marked by scents of pepper and espresso to go with the chocolate and cassis fruit.

68240,France,"Sure, this wine shows the effects of the hot summer in its slightly jammy raspberry flavors, but there's also incredible complexity to complement the fruit intensity—Asian spices, tea, pepper and meat, to name just a few nuances. It's all wrapped in a blanket of soft tannins, but stays fresh-tasting thanks to great minerality despite low acidity. Drink now–2030 or beyond.",,97,96.0,Rhône Valley,Côte Rôtie,,Syrah,Domaine Jamet
68241,France,"Chapoutier's top white in 2004 is this knockout cuvée parcellaire he calls De L'Orée. Aromas of truffles and honey burst from the glass, while the flavors lean toward peaches and toasted nuts.

Chapoutier
68242,France,"Le Méal is said to be the warmest terroir on the Hermitage hill, and thus it is no surprise that this bottling fared the best in the challenging 2004 vintage.

68243,France,"Chave's white Hermitage is even better than his acclaimed red in 2004. It's wonderfully toasty upfront, backed by layer upon layer of honeyed fruit that simply defies description. Yet despite the incredible richness, there's also tremendous focus and minerality, so that the wine never seems overly weighty, and it finishes with great length and intensity.

68248,France,"From 50-year-old vines, this is Sorrel's top cuvée of white Hermitage, laden with scents of truffled honey and almonds. Yet despite that obvious richness on the nose, it's a bit more restrained on the palate than the 2005, with a more powerful structure and marginally less lushness. Not better, not worse, just different: longer on the finish, more tightly constructed and probably longer-lived.",Les Rocoules,95,140.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Marsanne,Marc Sorrel
68249,Spain,"The bouquet explodes with tobacco, leather, dry oak and waves of berry fruit.

68310,Chile,"Slightly hard, burnt and earthy at first, with dark fruit sitting below that cap. The palate is tannic, thus the mouthfeel clamps down and closes up like a clam.

68326,Chile,"Definitely a dark wine with heavy concentration. Aromas are foresty and rich, but also soft and soupy. The palate is quite heavy and full, with reduced black fruit and herbal flavors.

Finishes upright, which is better than many. Not sophisticated but still good for Argentina.",Reserve,86,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Cruz Alta
68333,Argentina,"A nice, regular sort of Malbec for everyday drinking.

68353,Italy,"There's a fragrant element to the nose here that recalls white flowers, jasmine and orange blossom.

68354,Portugal,"An exotic blend including Pinot Noir and Merlot along with Portuguese varieties, taking its name from two local villages with saints' names.

68357,Argentina,"A big, sweet wine that doesn't have much teeth or bite but is friendly, rich and pleasing.

68367,Argentina,"Sort of sweet and gaseous to start, with rubbery, medicinal aromas. The palate is tight and closed, with warm, crusty dark-fruit flavors, an herbal influence and heat.

68370,US,"No doubt about it, this is a big, lusty Pinot Noir. From a low-production parcel of the estate, it routinely produces immensely concentrated wines. The winemaker's challenge is to give balance and harmony to grapes of this heft, and here, Iron Horse has it figured out. Dry and enormously ripe in cherries, black raspberries, cocoa and cola, it's good now with lamb chops, grilled steaks and similar upscale fare, and should soften and improve for five years.",Thomas Road,95,70.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Iron Horse
68371,France,"Wonderfully aromatic and complex, blending floral notes with mineral scents, bold cassis fruit and cracked pepper.

68372,France,"For white Hermitage, this is tight and minerally, with more structure than Chapoutier's other microcuvées and possibly more aging potential.

68373,Spain,"Classic in color, and backed by aromatics of lavender, graphite and pure blackberry. This is not overly weighty, as the acidity keeps it pointed and pure.

68375,Spain,"What a superb combination of new oak, leather, mineral, mocha and berry fruit this wine delivers.

Best in a few more years.",Finca El Bosque,95,145.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
68376,Spain,"Full and ready, this fabulous wine from Rioja Alavesa sets the bar very high for any of its Vanguardia co-runners. Gloria hits hard with bacon, tire rubber, tobacco and pastry crust aromas, but also pure dark fruit.

68377,France,"Delas's cuvée parcellaire is a rich wine that's almost syrupy in its concentration and tannic strength.

68378,France,"This was Chapoutier's initial microcuvée of Hermitage, bottled for the first time in 1989.

68379,US,"I have not been impressed by this bottling in past vintages, but the '05 establishes a new benchmark. Just exactly why is hard to say. Yields were exceptionally low in this long, cool vintage, and lots of new French oak frames dramatically rich, ripe flavors of mashed cherries and raspberries, sprinkled with cinnamon, a drop of crème de cassis, and a pinch of white pepper. The depth and length are beautiful.",Toulouse Vineyard,94,40.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
68380,France,"Intoxicatingly fruity and forward on the nose, this wine—a blend of Le Méal and Les Greffieux—follows up with rich layers of black fruit.

68387,Portugal,"Dark, dense and concentrated, with power and elegance. But somehow this complex wine also shows restraint and style.

68388,France,"Named after Alphonse Jr's father (Edmond Alphonse), this is the top wine from the Mellot estate. With its extra bottle age and wood flavors this is not typical Sancerre.

68393,France,"This bottling from Guigal's own Hermitage holdings is incredibly rich and ripe (15.5% alcohol). In fact, it comes dangerously close to being overblown before the syrupy cherry fruit is reined back in by underlying spice and minerality.

68396,US,"The most important aspect of this wine is acidity. Without it, it would be just another mushy, chocolate- and blackberry-flavored wine.

68397,Spain,"This is yet another magnetic example from the Eguren stable that includes El Puntido, San Vicente, Finca El Bosque and the many Sierra Cantabria wines.

68430,Italy,"There is a heavy or slightly fat quality to this Trebbiano from Tuscany that is enhanced by aromas of chestnut honey, almond, dried apricot and a slight touch of exotic herb. The wine is characterized by chewy density and soft succulence on the close.",Tribiana,86,,Tuscany,Toscana,,Trebbiano,Pieve de' Pitti
68431,Austria,"A rare cross between Roter Veltliner and Sylvaner, Neuburger is a restrained, elegant grape that gives a good, fresh citrus character, but not a huge series of flavors. With the low alcohol, treat this like a superior Pinot Grigio. Screwcap.",,86,10.0,Burgenland,,,Neuburger,Tinhof
68432,Italy,"The oak element is strong here and not totally integrated. Aromas of toasted wood and nut rise far above the fruit, which is delicate and low-key to begin with. You'll get tons of butter, almond and pineapple.",Pietrabianca,86,21.0,Southern Italy,Castel del Monte,,Chardonnay,Tormaresca
68433,Argentina,"Jammy stuff, with hints of mint, leather and cotton candy. The palate is basic, with adequate structure and nicely presented berry fruit as well as herbal accents.

68436,Chile,"Marshmallow sweetness and oak aromas give it a confected nose, while the mouth is weighty, concentrated and sappy, with mildly raspy berry and plum flavors.

68441,Argentina,"Starts with bulky fruit and bacon aromas. The palate is sort of rattled and jagged in terms of feel, while the flavors of baked berry fruit slip toward herbal.

68444,France,"Moderately intense with notes of baked apple, peach, toasted brioche and almond milk on the nose and palate.

68448,Chile,"A bulky wine with aromas of dried herbs, pepper and black fruits. It's meaty and thick in the mouth, with grapey, herbal flavors.

68449,Chile,"Clean, with a proper set of varietal aromatics. There's a bit of body and some cut to this Maipo SB, and also tasty lemon-lime, kiwi and honeydew flavors. Easy to drink; the perfect uncomplicated white wine for chilling and quaffing.",Estate,86,12.0,Maipo Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Haras

68452,France,"Here's a rich and smoky Chard with nice aromas and flavors of wood-grilled red apples with a caramel drizzle, peach pit and Key lime citrus.

68453,US,Quite big and decadent smelling as notes of caramel-drizzled apple pie with vanilla ice cream on top emanate from the glass.

68454,Italy,"This bright rosé from the Salento in Southern Italy offers unusual aromas of forest berry and a touch of moist earth or clay that give the wine a thicker texture and smoother sensation on the palate.

68458,Chile,"A little harsh and smelling of hard rubber, leather and horseradish along with tobacco and grilled meat. The palate feels a bit scratchy as it puts out standard raspberry and cassis flavors along with dryness and mild bitterness. Seems tougher and less flavorful than the '06.

68462,US,"This is the 33rd vintage of this landmark Zinfandel, which, since it's a blend that includes just 74% Zinfandel in it, isn't technically Zinfandel at all. Whatever.

68465,US,"All the components of fine Zinfandel are in top form here, from the opening fat, dark berry aromas to the deep, sweet fruit on the smoothly textured palate and the lovely fruit-acid balance. Closes handsomely, with full even tannins and some white pepper on the long back end.

68466,US,"Lovely nose, with coconut and hazelnut scents augmenting the cherry/berry fruit. Not an ordinairy set of scents and flavors, but enticing and distinctive. The fruit is intense and perfumed, and the accents of coconut seem just right.",Clockspring,90,18.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Milliaire
68467,Australia,"Comes on full and lush from the opening, with blackberry, chocolate, menthol and smoke aromas. In the mouth it delivers dark, dry flavors of plum, cassis and toasty oak and has good acidity that keeps it from getting mushy. The solid finish offers more of the same, a nice spiciness and some substantial tannins. Drink now; should be even better in two years.",Bin 128,90,22.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,,Shiraz,Penfolds

68470,US,"Ripe, strawberry/raspberry preserves, with a pleasing, jammy, fruity, luscious richness. Ten percent Petite Sirah adds color and punch.

68473,Canada,"Inniskillin continues to push the boundaries of icewine, as evidenced by this wood-aged Vidal. The vanilla and spice of oak barrels partially masks some of the stranger Vidal aromas, allowing the apricot and peach scents to come to the fore. There are some creamy lactic notes on the finish that detract slightly, but this is a very good effort at an entirely different genre.",Oak Aged Ice Wine,89,80.0,Ontario,Niagara Peninsula,,Vidal Blanc,Inniskillin
68474,Italy,"Displaying a ripe, multifaceted nose with violets, cumin, licorice, tar and chocolate elements, this wine shows class and grace with classic dry cherry flavors.

68476,US,"A blend of Peachy Canyon Estate (67%) and Mustang Springs Ranch (33%) fruit. In this vintage the Peachy Zins seem to lack intensity, but this is a well-balanced effort that shows the best of what is there.

68478,US,"There's some old-vine juice included in the blend, and it shows. The nose is lushly scented with plums, raisins, pie cherries and ripe red fruits, with some of that distinctive new mown hay quality that old vines send up. A little barnyard aroma too, in a good way. Very extracted and intense.",,89,16.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco
68479,US,"Herbs and spices dominate the nose, and the wine has an intriguing blend of 9% Petite Sirah, 2% Grenache and 2% Mourvèdre in it. Interesting and flavorful, though not entirely varietal in character.

68481,Australia,"Made for almost 40 years—since 1962—this edition of 389 sports lots of spicy American oak, and displays black fruit and tobacco aromas and flavors. The mouthfeel is big, the texture rich and the full, spicy finish is long and tannic. It's drinkable now, but really needs a few years to unwrap a bit, and the oak mantle will probably always be heavy. Satisfying, though somewhat one-dimensional.",Bin 389,89,19.0,Australia Other,Australia,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Penfolds

68486,US,"Orange, apricot and pineapple aromas ride over a deep bass note of earth and spice.

Could use a touch more acidity to really make the flavors sing.",Ice Wine,89,18.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Wagner
68487,Canada,"Wow, is this sweet—tooth-achingly sweet. The aromas and flavors are relatively pure and free of botrytis; instead you get boatloads of ripe pear and melon flavors, huge thickness and weight, and decent acidity. Almost too rich and sweet for its own good.",Ice Wine,88,50.0,Ontario,Niagara Peninsula,,Riesling,Cave Spring

68518,US,"Light and oxidative, with soft, toasty buttery flavors. The fruit is hidden behind all the buttered popcorn flavors. It's drinking well enough at the moment, but aging very quickly.",,85,24.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Holmes Harbor Cellars
68519,Argentina,"Pretty good and solid for an uncommon blend, but the Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio thrown together results in nice buttercup aromas along with some apple pie and pear. The palate runs sweet but maintains its freshness, and the flavors of apple, pear, melon and powdered sugar come together. A novelty wine that shows the right signs.",Reserva Chardonnay-Pinot Gris,85,15.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,White Blend,Domaine Jean Bousquet
68520,Spain,"A very pretty middle-aged wine that has at least another decade in it. At this point in time, the nose is still showing a lot of black-fruit aromas, while the palate is chewy, meaty and rich as it spreads out with ripe flavors mixed with touches of mushroom, truffle and vanilla. A fine Gran Reserva with equal bits of tradition and modernity showing through.",Gran Reserva,93,35.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
68521,US,"This is serious Syrah. It shows mountain intensity, with potent cassis, licorice, grilled meat, cocoa and gingersnap cookie flavors, enhanced by all the loveliness that fine new oak contributes to a full-bodied red wine. The tannins are strong and thick, but of the sweetly ripe type. Just lovely. Drink now and for the next few years.",Estate,93,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,Spring Mountain Vineyard
68522,France,"Alphonse Mellot Jr, the 19th generation of Alphonses to make wine at La Moussière, has raised his family's domaine to a new height. This is so evident in this super-rich, concentrated wine, but one that doesn't lose sight of its cool climate, chalk soil origins. So there's great opulence, but also a vivid green acidity that strikes right through the wine.",Génération XIX,93,61.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Alphonse Mellot
68523,US,"After a couple of off years, this bottling is back on form. The Porty edge is gone, and in its place is a gorgeously ripe wine with full control over the fruit. Raspberries, cherries, cassis, pecan pie, pumpkin pie, cocoa, gingerbread, cola, vanilla, Asian spice; the list goes on and on. Meanwhile the mouthfeel is pure velvet, the finish long-lasting. This is Dry Creek Valley Zin at its best.",Somers Ranch,93,30.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
68524,US,"After missing a beat in '04, the '05 reverts to the high quality of the '03. Made from Dijon clones, the wine shows a brilliant purity of cherry fruit, with rich, earthy complexities of mushrooms, forest floor, cola and balsam. Bone dry, it has an elegantly silky quality that cries out for the best foods. Best now and for the next four years.",Sangiacomo Vineyard,93,52.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
68525,France,"The 2004s at Ogier are tremendously successful, none more so than the family's top cuvée. The 2004 Belle Hélène boasts waves of creamy raspberry fruit framed by wonderfully supple tannins. Long-lasting on the finish, it's already delicious but should develop additional complexity through 2015.",Belle Hélène,93,199.0,Rhône Valley,Côte Rôtie,,Syrah,Michel & Stéphane Ogier
68526,France,"A big step up from Jaboulet's La Petite Chapelle, this is on a par with some of Jaboulet's past efforts. It's richly concentrated, yet nuanced, with notes of blood and mineral added to ripe cassis fruit and accented by hints of vanilla and spice. The tannins form an almost creamy texture in the mouth, and the finish lingers a good long time. Drink 2012–2025.",La Chapelle,93,215.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,Paul Jaboulet Aîné
68527,Portugal,"The top wine in the Quinta do Portal range is in its second vintage. With 12 months aging in French oak, the power is all there in very dark, heavy tannins that dominate the fruit.

68528,Portugal,"The joint venture between the Cazes family of Bordeaux and the Roquette family of Quinta do Crasto in the Douro is in its second released vintage.

The wood shows through on the finish.",Xisto,93,56.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Roquette e Cazes
68529,US,"The coolness of the site and the vintage has yielded a young, tart wine that fans of big, fat Chards might find lean and austere. But it's a grand wine for Burgundy lovers. Acidity is high, and there's a stony minerality undergirding the citrus, wildflower and smoky oak flavors. This is one of those rare Chards that needs some time to come around. Best 2008–2011.",La Cruz Vineyard,93,39.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Testarossa
68530,Spain,"Beautiful in color as it blends hues of purple and red. The nose is endowed with leather, herbs and cherry, while the full palate houses a delicious range of fruit and wood flavors along with fine tannins and length.

68531,US,"Like the winery's other 2005 Chardonnays, this one, tasted in March, is tightly wound and minerally. The aroma will show little if the wine is too cold. Flavor-wise, hints of tart tangerines, lemongrass, green apples, candied ginger and vanilla cream swirl into a smoky oak, spicy finish. This is a Chardonnay that needs some time in the bottle.

68532,Chile,"Five years ago we said Domus Aurea could become one of Chile's very best Cabernets. But then focus, winemakers and other things changed and the quality slipped. But Domus seems to be back with a vengeance in 2003. A nosing yields a lot of earth, tobacco and leather, while the sly but sure flavor profile is centered on baked plum and cassis along with some herbal, terroir-ish shadings. Still not for everyone, but very, very interesting and not generic.",,92,50.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Domus Aurea

68534,US,"Fully mature now, although it still has a good six years left, this shows why certain Zins benefit from aging. Tight and tannicly dry to begin with, it has aged to something approaching Pinot-like delicacy, although the wild berry, roasted coffee and spice flavors are Zinny, and few Zinfandels will ever have these tannins.",Stellwagen Vineyard,92,25.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
68535,US,"Nearly five years after it was made, this Syrah remains dark and tannic, but the fruit is starting to make the magical transition from primary to secondary. It's picking up dried blackberry, dessicated blueberry and beef jerky flavors that finish long and spicy. Yet it still has youthful acidity and freshness. This will be a fun wine to follow over the next five years.",Trenton Estate Vineyard,92,25.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Joseph Swan Vineyards
68536,Spain,"Char and chocolate, then a dollop of rum raisin and black cherry, and there is your nose. This version of Cirsion, one of our very favorite modern Riojas, is relatively soft, raisiny and simple, and for that it doesn't quite rate with some of the past vintages, which were spectacular. But that doesn't mean you won't love the wine's smooth texture, cocoa and baked berry flavors, and its overall generous character. Drink now through 2010.",Cirsion,92,273.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Roda
68537,US,"This is a new wine from Longboard. The vineyard is on Westside Road, in the Middle Reach area that is prime Pinot country. But somehow, Merlot loves it.

Really notable for its balance and harmony.",DaKine Vineyard,92,24.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Longboard
68538,Spain,"Right away this shows the requisite signs of excellence.

68539,Spain,"Like all young Sierra Cantabria wines made from old vines, this has a purple color that's supported by aromas of coffee, mocha and black fruits. It's half aged in American oak (the other half is French), and it's much more tannic, acidic and structured than the fleshy 2003. A wine with pure flavors and a dynamic structure.

68541,Portugal,"An impressively powerful wine, with concentrated fruit from old vines. It packs dense tannins, layers flavors of ripe figs, plums and raisins, along with wood flavors.

68544,Spain,"Benjamin Romeo makes nothing but big, idiosyncratic wines. And some are big hits while others may not be your thing. This modern, round, polished blend is creamy and smooth but also loaded with almond, pear, citrus and toast flavors. Certainly there's a strong wood element, but it handles it with aplomb and oozes class. Drink as soon as possible. It won't age much past 2007. Only 25 cases made.",Qué Bonito Cacareaba,92,74.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,White Blend,Benjamin Romeo
68545,US,"The name is a combination of eiswein and Scheurebe, the German variety. The grapes were artificially frozen. The wine is exceptionally sweet, with residual sugar of 21.5%, but balanced by crisp acidity, and the alcohol is amazingly low at 7.6%. Flavorwise, it's all about apricot preserves and vanilla. Hard to imagine anyone not liking this delicious dessert wine.",Eisrébe,92,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Scheurebe,Joseph Phelps
68546,France,"Wonderfully floral and spicy on the nose, with hints of anise that add nuance to the layers of raspberry fruit.

68547,US,"From estate-grown fruit, this is fragrant and off-dry, showing honeysuckle, Meyer lemon, tangerine and grapefruit in the mix of scents and flavors. It's a fine example of what Washington can do with Riesling, bringing bright, sappy fruit flavors to vibrant acidity, complex sugars and a lingering liveliness on the palate.

68560,Chile,"Smells like children's vitamins and apple cider. The palate is sugary and fine but rather nondescript; there's candied flavors and persistence, but what does it add up to?

68602,US,"The climate of New Mexico seems to suit the Viognier grape. Here it has given it a lovely, intense perfume of gardenia, orange blossom and guava. Though broad and soft in the mouth, enough acid comes through on the finish to save it from flabbiness. Serve as an apéritif.",Artist Series I,86,20.0,New Mexico,New Mexico,,Viognier,La Chiripada
68603,US,"Rich flavors of cherries, red currants and licorice mark this wine, leading to a spicy finish. It's a little aggressive in texture, though, with dominating acidity. Drink now.",SLH Estate,86,29.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Hahn
68604,Italy,"Here's a pristine and tonic Pinot Grigio from northern Italy presented in equally clean packaging. The wine delivers a crystalline appearance that is accented by measured aromas of citrus, light peach and white flower.",Altanuta,86,14.0,Veneto,Valdadige,,Pinot Grigio,Josef Brigl
68605,Italy,"Although this wine offers a neutral-smelling nose, it compensates with a bright, crystalline appearance and a genuinely soft and creamy mouthfeel. It's a delicate and feminine wine that would pair with avocado salad and feta cheese.",Conti Capponi Comitale,86,15.0,Tuscany,Colli della Toscana Centrale,,White Blend,Villa Calcinaia
68606,New Zealand,"This wine—a blend of steel-fermented and barrel-fermented lots—hides the oak well, displaying nicely pure melon, pear and citrus flavors that finish clean and refreshing. It's a balanced and easy-to-drink Chardonnay for drinking over the next 6–12 months.",,86,15.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Chardonnay,Stone Paddock
68607,Chile,"Leathery and gaseous at first, with murky earth, scrambled egg, sulfur and ultimately spicy fruit and grilled beef aromas. The palate is full and choppy, with thick, soupy black fruit and herbal flavors. Creamy on the finish. Good but simple Syrah.",Secreto,86,14.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Syrah,Viu Manent
68608,France,"Certainly crisp, but also showing some tropical fruit characters, this is clean, ripe Sauvignon Blanc. The aftertaste has hints of white currants. Screwcap.",,86,15.0,Burgundy,Saint-Bris,,Sauvignon Blanc,Simonnet-Febvre
68609,France,"Another great value from Arrogant Frog, this Viognier-Chard blend is fresh and delicious with flavors of rich wood-grilled apple, yellow florals, peach and toast. Medium weight and well balanced with a long finish. Drink now.",Lily Pad White,86,10.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Vin de Pays d'Oc,,Chardonnay-Viognier,Arrogant Frog
68610,France,"Sure it's oaky, but it tastes good, with the subtle menthol and bold vanilla flavors serving to highlight bright cherries. The silky texture is a highlight, then the finish shows off juicy fruit and fine tannins.",,88,11.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,,Red Blend,Le Rouge de Saint-Louis
68611,US,"Spicy, ripe fruit, with an edge to it. Well-defined wine, which shows briar, toast, berry and coffee flavors sprinkled throughout. Well-built, sturdy, a little hot, but balanced and long.",Catfish Vineyard,88,14.0,California,Clear Lake,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Zinfandel,Wildhurst
68612,US,"Sweet, spicy fruit, with nicely matched toasty oak framing it. Everything balances out; this actually has the best balance and most seductive fruit of the three Lolonis bottlings, and certainly represents the best value.",,88,20.0,California,Redwood Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Zinfandel,Lolonis
68613,France,"The dark color tells you right away this is no ordinary vin de pays. Then you sniff it and get cedar, black currants and blackberries. The finish has juicy acidity and dusty tannins, suggesting a couple years' cellaring may be warranted. Impressive.",,88,14.0,Rhône Valley,Vin de Pays du Gard,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,Mas de Guiot
68614,Australia,"A round, ripe pear and lemon nose opens this medium-weight, full flavored white. Grapefruit, spice and green apple coat the palate, the texture is fairly rich—maybe even fat for Riesling—but there's good acidity to support the fruit. Finishes long with white peach and mineral notes.",Reserve,88,18.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,,Riesling,Penfolds
68615,US,"The blackberry fruit is wrapped in very deeply toasted oak. Aromas and flavors of cassis, vanilla, coffee and licorice mingle to display a dark flavor profile but positive tart-sweetness. Full and even on the tongue, this black beauty finishes with lingering spice and espresso notes.",,88,24.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Robert Craig

68617,US,"Inky, opaque and tight, this wine offers a bouquet of black fruits and toast. Though the mouthfeel is full and supple, it is presently very closed and yields scant flavor definition beyond the presence of a very good depth of dark fruits and well-charred oak. Finishes dry, with somewhat more discernable blackberry and vanilla notes and moderately puckering tannins. Best for keeping; try in two-plus years.",St. Peter's Church Vineyard,88,40.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rosenblum
68618,US,"The ripe berry flavors wear a veil of deeply toasted oak in this smooth and supple wine, but does it with finesse. Flavorful, smooth and not weighty, it has a pleasing, even texture on the tongue and displays good persistence with berry, pepper and dark toast flavors lingering on the back end. Perhaps over-oaked, but suavely so.",Rhodes Vineyard,88,27.0,California,Redwood Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Zinfandel,Consilience
68619,Canada,"Shows ample evidence of botrytis on the apricot-scented nose, with less-dominant aromas of ultraripe pears and peaches blending in. It's very juicy and fruity, with some lime-like acidity that keeps it fresh. Best with fresh fruits, or try with a foie gras appetizer.",Botrytis Affected,88,30.0,Ontario,Niagara Peninsula,,Riesling,Henry of Pelham
68620,US,"Lovely attack, plummy and evolved, with no rough edges. The fruit is soft and sweet, layered and full, and the overall palate impression is of elegance and balance.

68623,South Africa,"The earth, smoke, saddle-leather aromas and flavors are powerful and distinctive but probably not to all tastes. The lavish high-toast oak is nearly over-the-top, but a creamy mouthfeel and long finish tip the scales to the pleasure side. Complex and challenging … but not for those averse to the elements mentioned.",Kevin Arnold,88,30.0,Stellenbosch,,,Shiraz,Waterford
68624,Canada,"Vidal has a peculiar bouquet that I have a hard time describing. This one boasts muskmelon, litchi and kumquat aromas, backed by a honeyed sweetness and grapefruit-like acids. Intense—verging on overblown—this is a fine example of what this French-American hybrid is capable of producing.",Special Select Late Harvest,87,25.0,Ontario,Niagara Peninsula,,Vidal Blanc,Henry of Pelham
68625,US,"Tar and cherries in the nose, and the follow-through shows thick, ripe, sweet cherry fruit with some dark, tarry underpinnings. Good concentration and a long finish. There is 11% Petite Sirah, which adds color and depth.",Estate,87,15.0,California,El Dorado,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Boeger
68626,US,"A lot of wood, still pretty rough, surrounds a thick, tannic, muscular, ripe, rustic, Old World-style Zin. There's nothing elegant about this wine, but it packs a lot of flavor into a sturdy frame.",Tollini Vineyard,87,28.0,California,Redwood Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Zinfandel,Lolonis
68627,US,"Good, thick, black cherry fruit, dense tannins, with a dark, dense, chalky finish. This is manly Zin—muscular, balanced and heavy. Great for outdoor grilling.",,87,22.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Zinfandel,Newlan
68628,US,"High toned, alcoholic nose, with cherry nail-polish scents. Cherries and plums fill the mouth, along with tongue-lashing tannins.

68629,US,"Old vines from Russian River and Alexander valleys go into this spicy, briary, gamy Zin. There's a dark undercurrent of tar, pipe tobacco and smoke that runs through the finish.

68630,Australia,"This solid red has deep currant and toasty oak aromas. It opens to rich dark berry, plum and leather flavors with Asian spice accents.

68632,US,"A fair amount of the cuvee is from the 130-year-old Grandpère vineyard, which lends a soft, herbal, grassy undertone to the wine. From elsewhere comes bright cherry fruit, and the wine seems a little disjointed, though it may come together in time. Some nail polish in the nose carries through to the finish.",La Grande Folie Old Vine,87,44.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Folie à Deux
68633,US,"This attractive wine opens with a nicely nuanced bouquet of berry, spice and earth accented by positive gamy and slightly barnyardy notes.

68635,US,"Full, forward, fleshy nose shows lots of bright, spicy fruit. Unlike a lot of lower cost Zins, this wine has a lot of sweet fruit, and enough body and weight to carry through past the nose into a big, satisfying finish. Nice toast, plenty of acid, a bit hot in the finish.",,87,12.0,California,Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Zinfandel,Shooting Star
68636,US,"The fruit is on the tart side, cranberries and raspberries, but the wine is fleshed out with plenty of vanilla oak, and fills the mouth with soft, seductive flavors.

68637,France,"Impressive dark purple in color, this powerful vin carries lots of toasted-oak aromas: menthol and cedar in particular. There's some promising dark fruit underneath it all that should emerge in a couple years' time. Less exciting than this winery's 1996, which leads to the question: could the creation of a luxury cuvée have had an effect on the quality of this wine?",,87,20.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Red Blend,Château Lagrézette
68638,US,"Tight as a drum, but a little cherry fruit escapes from the nose. It opens up into a sweet, lovely bottle of wine, with a bit of cocoa and coffee in the finish. Well-balanced, with sweet, clean fruit.",,87,10.0,California,California,California Other,Zinfandel,Cartlidge & Browne

68640,Argentina,"Aromas of roast plum and earth are a bit nutty and muddled, but overall this is a likable and slick wine with soft tannins and ripe candied-fruit flavors.

68642,US,"Tight, tart and lightly spicy, this leads with raspberry and strawberry fruit, amplified with moderately high acids.

68644,Spain,"Sweet and sour aromas amount to a prickly bouquet, while the palate has some flesh as well as freshness.

Good for everyday quaffing.",Gran Feudo Rosado,85,15.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Rosé,Bodegas Julián Chivite
68645,Spain,"The opening of earth, berry and leather aromas is solid enough, yet the palate is quite acidic, yielding semitart but exact flavors of pie cherry and plum.

68647,Argentina,"Nice on the nose, with masculine, dense aromas of ripe berry fruits. The palate begins snappy and gets more sheering as the wine unfolds; in the meantime, the cherry, berry and plum flavors are more compact than candied. Well-done for Bonarda, but slightly narrow and grabbing the more you get to know it.",Reserva,85,11.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Bonarda,Tupun

68652,Argentina,"Opens with fairly deep blackberry aromas, but there's also a stemmy edge to the bouquet.

68653,Portugal,"This brand, first produced in 1881, has been among the most famous in Portugal.

68656,Argentina,"Stemmy on the nose, with aromas of rhubarb, pie cherry and sucking candy. The palate is also candied, with a lean, fresh mouthfeel and floral, red-fruit flavors. Not a lot of darkness or concentration, but it does seem floral and refreshing. Shows some heat and scour on the finish.",Reserve,84,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Aconcagua
68657,Argentina,"Basic Torrontés aromas of citrus, greens and saline water greet you. The wine is light-framed and rings and zings on the palate.

68659,Argentina,"Tropical aromas of pineapple and melon are simple but clean, while the palate is fresh yet a little plump, with pineapple, mango, apple and banana flavors.

68662,Portugal,"This familiar brand of Vinho Verde has long been in a sweeter style. But this latest vintage seems to have brought out the fresh, crisp fruits, and pushed back the sweetness. The result is a delicious summer apéritif style that leaves a clean, light taste in the mouth.",Gatão,84,7.0,Vinho Verde,,,Portuguese White,Borges

68666,Argentina,"Yet another solid but unspectacular Malbec from Las Moras. The nose is rubbery and meaty, with leather and barnyardy brett notes.

68668,US,"Co-fermented with 3% Viognier, this tart and sharp-edged Washington Syrah sports bright berry fruit and just a hint of earth in the tannins.

68669,Argentina,"Neutral aromas of apple and peach kick it off, then round citrus and a mild hint of pickled vegetable and apple carry the palate.

68670,US,"Right now my preference between Mondavi's Reserve and regular Chard is the regular. This is a better wine, from a classic Chablisian point of view, but it needs time. It's firm and deep in fruit, with an impressive minerality, and the balance for aging.

68671,Chile,"A world-class wine from Chile? It has been for almost a decade, but now that it's pushing $100 we are looking at it quite critically.

Finishes layered and deep, with chocolate and mocha.",Alpha M,92,93.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Montes
68672,France,"From miniscule yields and the product of an outrageously hot, dry summer, this wine still shows some spice, but also jammier cherry and raspberry notes. Syrupy, jammy fruit dominates, but this wine doesn't lack for structure. Give it another 10 years in the cellar and its terroir will be more obvious.",Les Vieilles Fontaines,92,,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Syrah,Alain Voge
68673,France,"While Vacheron is famed for its reds, the whites are of an equal, if not greater, class. This big, dense, rounded wine is from one of the sunniest vineyards in Sancerre, and that shows in its power and richness.

68674,France,"A cherry-picked blend of six estate parcels, the 2003 Château d'Ampuis fills the gap in the Guigal hierarchy between the largely négoce Brune et Blonde and the single-vineyard bottlings. Aged 38 months in new French oak, there's an understandable layer of vanilla and spice, but also layers of lush berry fruit. Creamy and rich, with a long, surprisingly elegant finish.

68677,US,"Tolosa has been making seriously good Syrah for some years now. The quality shows not just in the ripeness, but in the acidity that gives the wine brightness and balance. This was a warm vintage, even in cool Edna Valley, and the wine shows extraordinarily powerful blackberry-pie filling, cherry compote and chocolate flavors, but that high acidity really makes the fruit sing.",1772 Edna Ranch,92,46.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Tolosa
68678,US,"A nice, rich Cab that shows off its Napa pedigree. It's a little soft and not an ager, but lush in black currant, blackberry tart, cherry pie, chocolate, vanilla, smoky oak and spice flavors that are delicious.

The '05 is their best yet, a dry, silky, light-bodied wine, with complex layers of cherry skin, rhubarb pie, root beer, rose petal and red licorice flavors, enhanced with toasted new oak. The winemaker seems to be striving to tame the aggressive character this vineyard can bring to Pinot, in favor of delicacy and elegance. He has largely succeeded. A wine to watch.",Garys' Vineyard,92,50.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Surh Luchtel
68686,US,"Doesn't say “dry” on the label, like so many others do, but it really is basically dry, which allows the palate to savor the pure fruit of the grape and the beautifully crisp acids. This really is one of the most balanced Rieslings in California, with a slate and petrol edge to the green apple, pineapple, nectarine and wildflower flavors. If you like aging your whites, it should effortlessly glide through the next 10 years in a cool cellar.",,92,22.0,California,Napa,,Riesling,Smith-Madrone
68687,US,"Testarossa always does a good job at keeping Garys' Pinots, which can be out-sized, tame. The '05 shows the vineyard's typicity in the big, ripe fruit and fullness of mouthfeel, yet stays elegant and polished. Cherries, black raspberries, sugared rosehip tea and sweetly smoky oak are the flavors, although the wine is fully dry on the finish. It will easily sustain some bottle age. Drink now–2010.",Garys' Vineyard,92,59.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
68688,Chile,"Ripe and full on both the bouquet and palate. It's a rich wine from a good year, and thus the prune, licorice and chocolate aromas take center stage. In the mouth, this multigrape blend that ranges from Bordeaux varieties to Pinot Noir is on the money. It's round, rewarding and full of deep black fruit and sweet, balancing fudge and candy. Better sooner than later, seeing that the perceptible acidity is minor.",Borobo,92,70.0,Rapel Valley-Casablanca Valley,,,Red Blend,Lapostolle
68689,US,"Shows all the hallmarks of the upscale Cabs the winery is better known for, from the softly sensuous mouthfeel, ripe fruit and judicious use of new French oak, to the long-lasting complexities. Red and black cherry jam, cassis, plum sauce, gingerbread, smoky vanillins, peppery spice, and it's all dry and balanced. What's not to like?

68691,Germany,"Make no mistake—this is full-bodied, but it carries its 14.5% alcohol without any sign of warmth, just mouthcoating layers of flavor.

68692,US,"A best barrels blend of the winery's various vineyards, which are numerous throughout California, Niclaire shows a balance and elegance that prove Pinot doesn't have to come from a single vineyard to be great. The '05 is a delicious wine, soft and gentle and rich in flavor, yet dry and balanced. It fills the mouth with cherry pie, cassis, cola, Asian spice and smoky oak flavors that last long on the finish. This is a real crowd-pleaser, but it's not an ager. Drink now.",Cuvée Niclaire,92,75.0,California,California,California Other,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
68693,Portugal,"From a single vineyard at Quinta do Crasto, this wine was fermented in open lagars. It is big, perfumed, packed with superripe fruit.

68696,Spain,"It has taken this bodega a few years to get it right, but in 2004 this blend of 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet is dark and rocking. The nose offers that modern but increasingly familiar blast of bacon, baked fruit pastry and leather, and the palate works its magic with black plum and smoked game flavors. If it were just a touch longer and richer toward the finish it might rank as a nuevo classico.",Finca Monasterio,91,42.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Baron De Ley
68697,Chile,"Dense and solid, this is top-flight Chilean Merlot without any hints of green to drag it down.

Properly tannic and balanced.",Cuvée Alexandre Apalta Vineyard,91,23.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Merlot,Lapostolle
68698,France,"Rather nutty—almonds—on the nose, then broadening out on the palate into apricots and oranges.

68699,US,"I like this wine for the way it mimics Napa cult Cab, yet carves out a distinct identity. Like Napa, it's dry, soft and ripely opulent, with rich blackberry, cassis, cherry, cocoa and oak flavors, housed in sweet, finely ground tannins.

68724,US,"This has been a hit-and-miss wine over the years, and this is one of the misses.

68742,US,"Tastes super-jammy and extracted in cherries and raspberries, and pretty oaky, too, with a veneer of vanilla and charred wood.

68743,US,"Ripeness is both this wine's blessing and its challenge. It's super-fruit in jammy blackberries, blueberries, currants and cherries, brightened by that famous Edna Valley acidity.

68745,Chile,"Try as we might to rally around this four-grape blend, things just aren't coming together. The nose is dry, cheesy and loses clarity with exposure to air, and while it's juicy and lively, it's also a common type of wine with high acidity and a spiky feel.

68747,France,"Although this wine is missing the seductive nose of many Gewürztraminers, it is impressive in the mouth with a rich texture and intense notes of rose water and cloves.

68748,Chile,"Starts with young, bouncy, foxy aromas and then settles on berry fruit and bacon fat.

68752,US,"Very tough in tannins now, and bone dry, but it's not showing the richness you want for it to survive time in the cellar.

68753,Chile,"Sweet basic cherry aromas are candied at first and then darker with airing. The palate is bold, juicy, a little aggressive and herbal, with ample berry and plum fruit at the base.

68758,Chile,"For a huge-volume wine, it's what we'd expect.

68776,Canada,"Peaches and pears, lemons and grapefruits come together in this harmonious late harvest wine that shows little evidence of botrytis. The high acidity gives it balance and makes it a great foil for fruit-garnished foie gras.",Select Late Harvest,87,23.0,Ontario,Niagara Peninsula,,Riesling,Henry of Pelham

68778,US,"There's a lively gaminess to the nose; a wild, Rhônish note, perhaps from the Carignane, Mourvèdre and Petit Sirah blended in. This wine is front-loaded: the flavors lighten up on the palate, and the finish is tight and tannic.",,87,18.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Peterson

68780,US,"Blueberry, spices, fruitcake, even a maple syrup note mark the nose of this fairly sweet Zinfandel. The somewhat candied quality to the berry fruit was not favored by all tasters, but the plush yet structured mouthfeel has significant appeal. Dark sweet-tart fruit and moderate, even tannins work together to provide a positive finish.",Rustridge Vineyard,87,18.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Zinfandel,Rosenblum
68781,South Africa,"Nicely balanced from nose to finish, this medium weight Cabernet is more French than New World in style, with tart berry and tobacco elements prevailing. Very smooth on the palate, it finishes with fine tannins and a lingering tobacco note.",Reserve,86,30.0,Stellenbosch,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Le Riche
68782,US,"Cortina refers to the soil type. The wine shows forward, pretty fruit, mixing berries and cherries, and follows up with bright, clean, mouth-friendly flavors. Falls off in the finish, with some dry tannins.",Cortina,86,26.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Seghesio
68783,US,"This wine, from a newly acquired property, is tart and young, grapy almost, with the fruit a little reduced. The wine seems to be in hiding. It falls off in the middle and finishes with tannin and little else. This may just need more time in bottle to blossom.",Mustang Springs,86,26.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Peachy Canyon
68784,US,"Interesting cedar, game and leather notes accent this wine's blackberry and chocolate aromas and flavors. There's an almost Rhône-like quality to this full-bodied, well-balanced wine.

68785,South Africa,"A jammy and meaty nose with dark currant, plum, and leather accents opens this straight-ahead, pleasing wine.

Displays judicious use of the differing attributes of the blended grapes and oak.",,86,16.0,Stellenbosch,,,Red Blend,Middelvlei

68787,US,"Honeyed mango and papaya flavors are accented by a citrus streak that provides much-needed verve, while the aromas are more along the lines of pear and lemon.

68788,France,"Dark earth and tobacco spice the aromas of this grand cru, followed by flavors of black cherries and herbs.

68794,Greece,"A sweetish nose of cherry, plum and berry tinged with spice leads on this pleasant wine from Mythic River, a Syrah and Agiorgitiko blend.

68796,Argentina,"A big, roasted and fiery nose is act one, while act two offers a raisiny palate with black cherry and cassis flavors. This is a saturated, rough, gritty wine that's defined by baked, dark flavors and then coffee and roasted fruit on the finish. A hot-climate wine with integrity but marginal balance.",,84,13.0,Other,La Rioja,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chañarmuyo
68797,Italy,There's an awkward note here that recalls Amaretto layered over lemon soda. The wine tastes spicy in the mouth with more bitter almond on the close.

68798,Argentina,"Starts with thick, raisiny aromas and later perfume and violets enter the scene. But in the mouth it's sort of thick and lumpy, with blackberry and cassis flavors but not much verve, tannin or acidity. Seems top-loaded, without much structure or finish to seal the deal.",,84,9.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Conquista de Argentina
68799,Spain,"Initial aromas are squarely in the bell pepper/jalapeño mode, and later moss and earth enter the picture. The palate is basic, a bit acidic, and saucy, with herbal red-fruit flavors and a finish of tomato and basil. Struggles a little, but solid in a “country” sort of way. The blend is Tempranillo, Garnacha, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.",Reserva,84,40.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Red Blend,Bodegas Alconde
68800,Italy,This wine is not very generous on the nose (you expect more fragrance from Sauvignon) and offers measured notes of stone fruit and white mineral.

68803,Spain,"Tan in color and smelling fairly oxidized. Aromas of peach pits and blanched almond lack freshness, while the palate veers more toward applesauce than fresh fruit.

68804,Spain,"Chunky spiced apple and saline aromas get the wine off on so-so footing, and the apple and grapefruit flavors come with weight. Citrus takes over on the finish, but it's kind of pithy.

68805,Argentina,"There's no escaping the wine's funky, leathery aromas that settle on moss and earth.

68820,Spain,"With its spice and fig aromas, this registers as a rich, mature Rioja reserva. The palate runs toward sweet plums and blackberry, while the finish is mildly toasty and full, with coffee as the lasting flavor. This has many good qualities, not the least of which is balance and a touch of citrus peel. Best now–2010. 525 cases produced.",Cata de Consejero,91,58.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Consejo de la Alta
68821,Spain,"A sweet, ripe, jammy style for Roda I, with smooth tannins, corpulence and more than adequate minerality and power.

68822,Spain,"Thick, brooding and aromatically mature, this delivers heft, grab and balance. It has developed black-fruit flavors followed by a cushioned, soft finish.

Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Reserva,91,77.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Remírez de Ganuza
68823,Italy,"There's a subtle elegance to this wine that really sets it apart from the rest. The aromas are defined and fresh, bringing in mixed herbs, stone fruit and crisp minerality. It's very soft and feathery light in the mouth with layers of fruity nuances: After a period on the lees, it ages six months in Slavonian oak casks.",Haberlehof,91,22.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Pinot Bianco,Alois Lageder
68824,US,"Rich and dry, with a wealth of blackberry and cherry tart flavors, straight from the oven with the smoky-sweet, cinnamon and burnt butter tang of the crust.

68825,France,"Delas's big bottling of Hermitage blends three sites, including Les Bessards and L'Hermite to make a Hermitage that should be relatively easy to find at close to 2,000 cases produced. The 2005 is a muscular wine with dusty tannins that demands cellaring, even though it does show attractive notes of cassis and a distinctive blood-iron-mineral streak. Try after 2015.",Marquise de la Tourette,91,67.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,Delas Frères
68826,New Zealand,"Broad and sweet, but the sugars are amply balanced by this wine's dusty minerality and dried-spice character.

68827,Spain,"You're going to like this masculine, well-oaked blend of 80% Tempranillo with 10% each Graciano and Garnacha. It's got modern touches but a lot of tradition as well.

68829,US,"This moderately off-dry (1% residual sugar) Columbia Valley Riesling explodes from the glass with big, round aromas suggestive of ripe melon, tropical fruits and citrus. The balance is perfect, with plenty of natural acidity. The winemaker notes, with unusual aplomb, that “With bottle aging the fermentation aromatics of Bazooka bubblegum will develop into classic, and very subtle petroleum aromas.” Who's going to argue with that?",,91,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Riesling,J. Bookwalter
68830,US,"There's a savage quality to this Syrah, suggesting fresh wild berries growing in fields of lavender, rosemary and pepper tree, and something animal, like roasted meat bone. Under all that it erupts with intense cherry and blackberry fruit, and the sizable tannins make for a puckery feeling. This is quite an interesting Syrah that will gain in complexity over the next five years.",Benediction,91,32.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Manzanita Creek
68831,Spain,"This seems eminently ageworthy; it has the strong foundation and pulsing acidity required of a true cellar dweller.

Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Torre Muga,91,90.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Muga
68832,US,"The grapes barely got ripe in this vineyard in chilly Marin, just north of the Golden Gate. The numbers tell the story. Acidity is .082 grams, alcohol is 11.8%, there's no oak, and the wine was stirred on the lees for five months. The result is an impressive Riesling, one of the driest on the market, a wine of great delicacy and subtlety. Fruit isn't the star here; minerals are. This is a wine to watch.",The Shell Mound,91,22.0,California,Marin County,North Coast,Riesling,Pey-Marin
68833,Portugal,"The name refers to the big meander the Douro river takes around the quinta's vineyards, forming a long peninsula. Like its big brother, the quinta wine, this reflects the heat and the concentrated fruit that comes from this famed vineyard.

68834,Portugal,"The darkest, most impressive version of the Duas Quintas brand, this Reserva is made in the open lagars, from foot-trodden grapes in the tradition still used by major Port houses.

68835,New Zealand,"With its relatively modest alcohol (10.5%) and lovely sugar-acid balance, this Riesling could pass for an excellent spätlese. Aromas are floral and fruit-filled, yielding hints of apple, pineapple and even a suggestion of red berries, while the flavors echo with apples, stone fruit and strawberries. Clean and fresh on the finish. This is delicious now, but should hold at least 5–6 years, maybe longer.",Waldron Vineyard,91,35.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Villa Maria
68836,Chile,"Attractive mint and spice aromas play with herbal black fruit on the firm bouquet, and after that there's plenty of blackberry and plum to propel the palate.

It may not have the potency and density of fruit of the 2003, but it isn't lacking.",Clos Apalta,91,70.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Red Blend,Lapostolle
68837,Spain,"A dense wine from the start, and each subsequent whiff of the oaky but vital nose is convincing. The palate here is exemplary, especially for an '02; there's dark berry and plum flavors backed by notes of black licorice and pepper. An exceedingly nice wine with a textbook mix of tannins, flesh and acidity.",Reserva,91,28.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Ostatu
68838,France,"From old vines on chalky soil, this wine minerality as well as concentration. It is crisp but full, ripe but fresh. There's a touch of spiciness to complement the ripe green plum and apple skin flavors.",Les Caillottes,91,30.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Pascal Jolivet
68839,US,"A big, rich, almost chocolaty Pinot, with some of those darker flavors offset by brighter cherry notes.

68840,France,"From clay and chalk soil, Boisfleury is the finest of Alain Cailbourdin's three cuvées.

This should age well—over 5 years.",Cuvée de Boisfleury,91,,Loire Valley,Pouilly-Fumé,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine A. Cailbourdin
68841,France,"Bottled only a few months prior to this tasting, the wine was still rather closed aromatically, but wonderfully ripe and supple on the palate.

68842,US,"A lovely wine, soft, supple and complex. It shows ripe, forward flavors of blackberries, cassis, mushu plum sauce, chocolate and oaky smoke and vanilla, with a sweet, wild edge of lavender and violets.

68843,US,"Enormously ripe berries characterize this wine; it explodes with wild raspberries, cherries, blackberries and dark chocolate, with a peppery, minty finish.

Best now, with decanting, and for several years.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,91,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem

68846,France,"A selection of Voge's oldest vines from an especially granitic southeastern exposure, this is more of everything than the Vieilles Vignes bottling—more intense, smoky, dense and dark.

68847,Italy,"This is impressive on many fronts, not least of which is the fact that it is one of the first wines in Italy to boast a glass cork.

68848,Chile,"It doesn't take an expert to quickly realize that this is a fine Cabernet. The nose deals potent black cherry and char, while airing unleashes a subtle perfume and floral notes. In the mouth, there's ripe berry flavors and chocolate, while late in the game the tannins stay smooth but tight. A congruent wine with no flaws.

The sweetness seems to get stronger as the wine warms up, making it an awkward sip.",Winemaker's Block Selection,83,50.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacMurray Ranch
68864,Chile,"Floral up front, with a bit of citrus blossom. More round than linear, with plump melon flavors and a hint of grapefruit. Full and easy on the finish. A very simple white wine. Imported by Morande USA.",Terrarum Reserve,83,11.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Morandé
68865,US,"Not my favorite kind of Zin because of the sugary fruit and coffee flavors that suggest residual sweetness. On the positive side, the wine has a good structure, with rich tannins and crisp acids.",Sierra Series,83,10.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Renwood
68866,Chile,"The bouquet enters into the land of exotic, with aromas of sandalwood and cinnamon. But from there the wine loses steam, offering only basic plum and berry flavors followed by an earthy, almost murky finish. Doesn't show enough in the middle and late stages to rate better. Imported by American Wine Distributors.",Reserva,83,14.0,Limarí Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Viña Tabalí
68867,US,"Very pale in color, very light in flavor, and tart, this Pinot doesn't offer much in the way of flavor. It has modest cherry flavors.",,82,15.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Jekel

68869,US,"Tastes overripe and hot, with a raisiny, stewed prune edge to the otherwise pleasant blackcurrant and cherry flavors. Too bad, because the tannic structure is very nice. That cooked taste is not going to age out.",,82,24.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Waterstone
68870,Chile,"A hard wine that doesn't elicit a smile. The nose is peanutty and prickly, while the palate is pure lemon-lime extract. Finishes firm, almost sour.",Santa Digna Selection,82,11.0,Curicó Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Miguel Torres

68872,South Africa,"Despite this wine's golden hue, it has many green characteristics. Herbal notes come through in the nose and mouth, mixing with mineral and banana.

68873,US,"The winery has a mixed record with Cabernet and this release doesn't advance the cause. It's sharp in acids, with stalky, green notes, and the thinness of flavor accentuates the tannins, making them astringent.",Grand Reserve,82,36.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bighorn

68880,Argentina,"Powerful but reduced, with gritty berry aromas and a ton of clove on the nose. There's a carry over of the clove in the mouth, and also roasted fruit flavors, wood spice and sweetness.

68889,Italy,"There are distant floral notes here, but in general this blend of Trebbiano and Vermentino from Grosseto, Tuscany seems initially closed. Perfumed aromas of jasmine and honeysuckle do burst through from time to time and the wine is crisp and snappy on the close.",Cuccallegro,85,,Tuscany,Montecucco,,White Blend,Piandibugnano
68890,US,"A clumsy wine. While there's some good blackberry fruit, the mouthfeel is sharp and edgy, suggesting green stems and pips resulting in hard tannins. Doesn't seem likely to age out.",Cañon Creek Vineyard,85,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Midsummer Cellars
68891,Argentina,"Pretty well composed on the nose, with a core of blackberry. The palate runs narrow and grabby, but the generic sweet berry fruit is tasty, albeit ultrasimple. Snappy on the finish, with the gritty feel of cherry and grape skins. Good in a basic way.",,85,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Mil Piedras
68892,US,"Rather simple, like a blackberry-infused cola punch. It's the kind of red wine to serve at a party, and everybody will like it, but there's not a whole lot going on right now. Could develop in the bottle.",,85,79.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Prestwood
68893,Chile,"So lean, green and austere that it's almost a ghost. The nose is kind of vegetal more than fruity, while the acidity is so staunch that it penetrates the tongue membrane and sizzles a bit. Flavors of lime and sour apple lead to an acidic, tart finish. Needs more than just crispness.",Ventolera,85,14.0,Leyda Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Viña Litoral

68895,France,"A very flowery interpretation with gardenia, freesia and carnations on the nose that carry over to the palate where they merge with fresh orange peel.

Should be drunk up in a year or two.",Prestige,85,14.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Cave de Ribeauvillé
68896,Argentina,"Smoky and rubbery on the nose, with some green oak aromas. The palate has a soft, pasty quality to it as well as flavors of black cherry and mildly roasted berries.

There's size, tropical fruit and green banana all over this wine, but not much spine or structure. Drink now.",,84,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Zolo
68959,Argentina,"Not very vivid in color, with aromas of rhubarb, raspberry and red licorice candy. The palate is a touch scratchy, with flavors of cassis and brown sugar but not a whole lot of true Cabernet character. The finish has a slight tannic bite, but overall this is generic red wine to the max.",Finca La Linda,84,11.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Luigi Bosca
68960,Spain,"With raisiny, damp aromas and a flat body, we can only label this Marqués de Murrieta high-ender a miss. While not a disaster, you'd expect more from something labeled Gran Reserva Especial, but instead it fails to capture the essence of Rioja and shows heavy cola, blackberry and truffle flavors as well as deep, dull tannins. Overripe to begin with?",Castillo Ygay Gran Reserva Especial,84,54.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Murrieta

68965,Portugal,"It takes a while for the taste of this light, fresh white to come through. Then, it is soft, creamy textured, flavored with pear juice and lemon zest. It is simple, easy, cleanly made.",Portada Branco,84,8.0,Estremadura,,,Portuguese White,DFJ Vinhos
68966,Portugal,"A fresh, slightly sweet rosé, that keeps crispness through its bright, breezy strawberry flavors. The wine is soft, crisp, clean, a summer rosé.",Portada Rosé,84,8.0,Estremadura,,,Portuguese Red,DFJ Vinhos
68967,Australia,"This wine lacks a bit of intensity, but otherwise shows reasonably complex flavors of dried cherries and old wine barrels and a supple, creamy texure. Turns a bit tart and astringent on the finish, limiting its appeal.",,84,28.0,South Australia,Adelaide Hills,,Pinot Noir,Alta
68968,Argentina,"Early sulfur and rotten-egg aromas are none too attractive, but in the mouth the wine is better. While sweet as sin, the soft, lush palate is a chocolate-lover's dream, and the finish is like mocha ice cream.

68971,France,"A selection from old vines and made only in good years, Landrat-Guyollot's Carte Noire is rich and creamy, with concentrated white and yellow fruit flavors, some melon, white currants and pink grapefruit. Weighty, promising aging over 5 years.",Carte Noire,91,33.0,Loire Valley,Pouilly-Fumé,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Landrat-Guyollot
68972,France,"From old vines, partially destemmed and aged in old (3–10 years) barrels, this is a wonderfully pure expression of Cornas. Think fresh blueberries with a sprinkling of clove and a dash of black pepper. Firm tannins mark the finish; this needs at least five more years of aging.",Granit 60,91,49.0,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Syrah,Domaine Vincent Paris
68973,Spain,"Broad-shouldered and muscled-up, this hearty wine seems more youthful than it is.

It's right on the money.",Coto de Imaz Gran Reserva,91,39.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,El Coto
68974,Italy,"This is a gorgeous juicy-red-fruit driven wine with complex and interwoven nuances of blueberry, cherry, cookie dough, chocolate chip and soft vanilla oak playing a supporting role (the wines sees 18 months of oak). Deep and dark in color, the wine is about as creamy-smooth on the palate as they come.",Castel Ringberg Riserva,91,38.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Lagrein,Elena Walch
68975,France,"Toasty upfront, with blatant oak and vanilla scents, but the wood is matched by the wine's fruity—raspberry and blackberry—intensity. This is lip-smacking, mouthwatering stuff that can be drunk now and over the next 10 years.",Confidence,91,,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Syrah,Éric & Jöel Durand
68976,France,"Comprised of fruit purchased from several growers and matured in only about 20% new oak, this is an authentic expression of Cornas, yet one with a surprising degree of elegance. Meaty, bloody and smoky on the nose, with hints of cedar and cinnamon, but with ample concentration of cassis and mulberry fruit. Complex and long on the finish. Drink now–2020.",Chante-Perdrix,91,,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Syrah,Delas Frères
68977,France,"Shows the wood from barrel fermentation and maturation a bit on the nose, but also plenty of citrus. It's broad, yet reined in a bit by oak spice right now, needing time to flesh out. Hard to say it's better than the excellent '04 version, but it's still excellent.",Au Coeur des Siècles,91,,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Marsanne,Cave de Tain
68978,Italy,"Characterized by its crystalline luminosity, this delivers aromas of tomato leaf, white stone and white fruit. There's a cooling blast of refreshing crispness on the close.

68979,Spain,"Bramble, cherry cola and snappy red berry aromas announce this as a secure, snappy wine. The flavor profile is round, genial and nicely balanced between plum and berry and vanilla/mocha notes. Like most Sierra Cantabria reds, this touches all the bases and should elicit a smile of satisfaction.",Cuvée Especial,91,24.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
68980,US,"Give this youthful wine some time to settle down. Tasted in late March, its parts had yet to mesh. The acidity, oakiness and fresh grapy flavors are at some odds with each other. By winter of 2007, it should be a fine, complex Chardonnay, and drink well for five years.",Bien Nacido Vineyard,91,28.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Stephen Ross
68981,Portugal,"The fine, ripe, structured character of Touriga Nacional is well evident here. It may be big in alcohol, but the wine wears that easily, going more for fresh tannins and acidity, for black currant and dark plum flavors and smooth, vanilla flavors from the French wood aging.",,91,100.0,Douro,,,Touriga Nacional,Quinta do Crasto
68982,Portugal,"Structured, rich, but also with good fresh acidity, this is one of the best wines in the Quinta do Portal range. It has lively, vibrant red fruit, along with dry tannins, some vanilla from wood aging. Great acidity in the aftertaste.",Reserva,91,17.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Portal
68983,France,"Denser and more minerally than Jaboulet's Les Grandes Terrasses bottling, this is a serious Cornas, brimming with blood and iron notes wrapped in a richly tannic cloak.

68984,US,"Big, raw and frankly not really showing its best now, this young Zin needs time in the bottle. It has everything that it takes for two or three years aging, at least. Aromas and flavors of crushed pepper, fennel seed and cardamom spice up the blackberry, roasted coffee and bitter chocolate flavors, while the tannins are hefty, but negotiable.",Feeney Vineyard,91,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
68985,Portugal,"From Aliança's Alentejo Terrugem vineyard, this dense, tannin-packed wine has powerful flavors of dark fruits, a very dry backbone and layer upon layer of tarry, smoky tastes. Initially it overwhelms with its richness, but that softens and the acidity gives the wine a lifted vibrancy.",Quinta da Terrugem,90,23.0,Alentejo,,,Portuguese Red,Caves Aliança
68986,New Zealand,"Drier-tasting and slightly more austere than the Fletcher Family Vineyard bottling, this Riesling from Craggy's own vineyard in Martinborough features zesty lemon and lime aromas and flavors backed by various spices, including ginger and clove. It's medium-bodied, with a long spice-and-citrus finish.",Te Muna Road Vineyard,90,24.0,Martinborough,,,Riesling,Craggy Range
68987,France,"Makes a splashy entrance, flashing hints of smoke, toast and vanilla, but there's a firm core of mineral and spice at the heart of this wine that will need some time to emerge.

68990,US,"On a par with Beaulieu's reserve Pinots of the last several years, maybe a touch riper.

Pair with lamb with mint sauce.",St. Valentin,90,50.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Pinot Nero,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano
68992,Italy,"Deeply ruby, almost purple, in appearance, this is a thickly concentrated wine with a massive load of blueberry in center stage. Just enough room is left to allow delicate nuances of chalk, almond skin and garden herbs at the periphery. Excellent solid structure and good length on the finish make this a showcase Lagrein.",Porphyr Riserva,90,47.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Lagrein,Cantina Terlano
68993,France,"Powerful, intense and packed with rich green fruits, this is the top wine from Thierry Redde.

Drink now, or keep for another year.",Cuvée Majorum,90,,Loire Valley,Pouilly-Fumé,,Sauvignon Blanc,Michel Redde et Fils
68994,Australia,"Only contains 1% Viognier, so maybe the impression is subliminal, but there does seem to be a hint of apricot to this wine's raspberry-blueberry fruit and cracked pepper.

68995,US,"With a greenish tinge to the straw color, this is an ultradry, very crisp wine, especially notable for terrifically clean vibrancy.

Easily one of the best $10 wines of the year.",,90,10.0,California,North Coast,North Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Melanto Terrace
68996,France,"Fragrantly herbal and peppery on the nose, even coming a little close to vegetal before pulling back and showing more cherry fruit.

68997,France,"It's smoky, toasty and even a bit bacon-scented from its upbringing in 100% new French oak, but this is also a lush, warm, inviting mouthful of wine, filled with cassis fruit and framed by spicy wood. It's 95% Merlot from a hot vintage, so not likely to age all that long, but it's certainly delicious now.",Château de Launay,90,27.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Domaines Arnaud de Raignac
68998,France,"This grand cru Riesling screams of terroir.

68999,US,"Finally, a Zin that bursts with ripe, rich fruit, but isn't high in alcohol or sugary sweet.

69001,US,"Dry and tart, with fruit so thin it accentuates the alcohol, this wine shows how hard it is to produce a good, inexpensive Pinot Noir. It's properly silky. If only they could have figured out a way to boost the flavors.",Lot 8,82,10.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Cameron Hughes

69017,US,"What went wrong in the making of this wine was excessive sugar. It's so sweet, it's off-dry, a serious flaw in a table wine, and a disservice to consumers who expect a Sauvignon Blanc to be dry.",Spring Hill Vineyard,80,18.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Gann
69018,US,"The flagship of Krug's new Limited Release offerings, IX Clones refers to the nine different clones of Cabernet Sauvignon that comprise this wine. The result is more complexity than in the ""regular"" Limited Release Cab and a firmer, chewier finish that suggests cellaring 4-7 years prior to consumption. It's full and creamy-textured on the palate, with aromas and flavors that hint at smoke, cassis, tobacco, cedar and a multitude of dried spices. Should be great, starting in 2010. Only problem? Just 75 cases were produced.",Limited Release IX Clones,93,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Charles Krug
69019,US,"Charles Krug's Limited Release program sets a new level of quality for this Napa stalwart. This Cabernet Sauvignon boasts plenty of smoky oak on the nose, but also bold cassis fruit and hints of vanilla and tobacco.

69020,US,"Despite plenty of vanilla and oak on the nose, this Cab Franc is powerful enough to show plenty of varietal character: scents of tobacco and flowers are accented by just the merest hint of green bean. On the palate, the cassis fruit stands out, shaded by layers of cinnamon and clove, with less weight than a Napa Cabernet Sauvignon. Supple, spicy and long on the finish.",Limited Release,91,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Franc,Charles Krug
69021,US,"This inky wine barely meets the labeling requirements for Syrah (the balance is Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot), but still boasts plenty of that grape's varietal character in its slightly peppery scents, meaty flavors and blackberry and mulberry fruit.

69023,US,"This single-vineyard bottling is  great. It's a huge, deep wine, brilliant in black currant, green olive and cocoa flavors, yet packed in big-time mountain tannins that pretty much shut it down on the finish.

If you have a single bottle, it should be great in ten years, if cellared properly.",Wurtele Vineyard,96,50.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Terra Valentine
69024,Italy,"Enthusiastic applause across the panel for this blockbuster wine made by superstar enologist Carlo Ferrini. Modern, concentrated and packed with plump fruit, black pepper highlights, vanilla and chewy meatiness. One panelist likened it to Californian Syrah.

69025,US,"It's hard to imagine a more voluptuous wine, but it's also powerful and complex, offering up endlessly changing palate impressions. The primary flavor is ripe, juicy blackberries, while fine oak does its thing. The tannins are wonderfully soft and refined.

69026,US,"Spectacular, with opening young wine characteristics displaying naturally tart, spicy mixed red fruits.

It finishes gracefully with nuances of iron filings and fresh herb.",Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,95,45.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Andrew Will
69027,US,"Incredible fruit intensity. Cranberry, pomegranate and cherry meet rock, gravel and pepper. Lovely focus and purity; it's concentrated and tight, with a minerality that is compelling and distinctive. The best yet from Cailloux. Syrah is co-fermented with 4 or 5% Viognier.

69028,US,"I liked Morgan's Double L Chard for its Chablis-like character. This wine is more so. It's drier, more acidic and more elegant, but there's nothing lean about the power of its core of tropical fruit, which detonates on the palate and doesn't stop.

69035,Chile,"Silly name and label, but not a bad wine. The nose is meaty, medicinal and fails to hold its form over extended airing, but early on it's good and honest, as is the palate of herbal tomato and cassis flavors. A little bit scrappy, but for $10 it's better than most.",,85,10.0,Central Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sassy Bitch

69037,Argentina,"Subtle on the nose, with restrained berry, cherry and citrus peel aromas. The palate is a little grabby but mostly fresh in its approach, with flavors of fresh berry fruit.

69044,Argentina,"Slightly oily on the nose, with a fair amount of baby powder. The palate is round and wet, but also fairly regular in its intensity and approach. Flavors of green melon run toward fat and easy, while the finish is in the same mode.",,85,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Bodega Norton
69045,US,"Quite sharp in acidity, giving a bite of tartness to the dry flavors of cola, cherries, sandalwood and pepper. A good, silky Pinot for drinking now.",Cool Coastal Vineyards,85,16.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,De Loach
69046,France,"Lemon and hay aromas on the nose get overtaken by a strong flavor of fall leaves in the mouth. Fairly dry and medium-bodied, this is a good choice with a wide variety of lighter fish and chicken dishes. But pick this one up soon for it's starting to show its age.",Les Princes Abbés,85,27.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Domaines Schlumberger
69047,France,"This wine makes you work harder than many of its neighbors to find the flavor but it's worth the effort when you uncover an intriguing mélange of hay, apricot and early summer fruits. The crisp, minerally finish puts one in mind of a platter of choucroute garnie. Drink now to 2013.",,85,15.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Dopff & Irion
69048,Chile,"Mild toast and banana aromas are simple, subtle and quiet. The palate has a citrusy zest to it along with simple flavors of kiwi, melon and green grapes. Finishes wet and easy; a good wine but nothing to go nuts over.",Natura,85,11.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Emiliana
69049,Chile,"Roasted, leafy aromas greet you, followed by familiar scents of cherry and plum. The body is light to medium, with citric acidity turning the raspberry and pie cherry palate in the direction of snappy. Lithe on the finish, with a quick fade-away.",,85,10.0,Central Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cono Sur

69051,Chile,"A bit foxy and jumpy at first, and then familiar aromas of berry and plum settle in. The palate is jammy and tannic, while flavors of berries and currants seem roasted. Tobacco and olive notes are present on the chewy, weighty, textured finish.",Reserva,85,12.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Porta
69052,Argentina,"Pungent and a little pickled on the nose, with oak and cream coming on a second wave. The palate is composed, normal in feel and shows slightly choppy cherry and berry flavors. Regular but short on the finish. Good wine; nothing more than that.",,85,13.0,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,Ombu
69053,Chile,"A dark, chunky wine with cola, cassis and beet-like aromas. The palate is extracted but gritty, with big blackberry fruit that doesn't change or improve in the mouth. Deep as night but dull-edged; it flat-lines on the finish.",Cabernet Franc-Carménère,85,11.0,Maule Valley,,,Red Blend,Oveja Negra
69054,US,"A medium bouquet of apple, lemon and a touch of fresh young peach. The oak is there but not overpowering. The palate is well structured with good acidity and a medium weight followed by a lengthy finish.",Grand Cru,85,15.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Chardonnay,Raphael

69056,Chile,"Very dark and grapey, with raisin, licorice and bite to the bouquet. Saturated and heavy in the mouth, with lemony acidity framing loud, generic black fruit flavors. The finish features ample oak in the form of butter and coconut. A little overripe and oaky, but on the right path.",Reserva de Familia,85,15.0,Rapel Valley,,,Malbec,Santa Carolina
69057,Chile,"The bouquet is arguably the best part: earthy berry fruit mixed with tobacco and leather. The palate, meanwhile, is fairly hard and clipped, with short cherry and berrry flavors in front of a fast-moving, tough finish. Not a bad wine but tough on the tongue.",Winemaker's Collection,85,15.0,Maule Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,Simone
69058,France,"Not overdone or overripe, here's a rich Chard that boasts fresh peach and red apple notes with notes of tropical fruit acidity.

69059,Italy,"This is a distinctive white blend (with Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Verduzzo and Vermentino) with slightly oxidized aromas of almond, honey and mature apricot. There are both mineral and herbal qualities that help bring it back into line. The wine ends with a subtle touch of sweetness.",I Cerroni,85,,Tuscany,Toscana,,White Blend,Vallorsi

69061,France,"Another Cahors from the stable of Alain-Dominque Perrin, this one is the entry-level wine, made to be more accessible than his flagship wine from Château Lagrezette or the luxury cuvée. There's still plenty of toasty oak, but also some raspberry-cherry fruit and green tobacco on the finish.",,84,11.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Red Blend,Castel Montplaisir
69062,US,"Blackberry aromas with tobacco accents turn slightly barnyardy. Brisk acidity supports the solid, spicy red and black berry fruit here, but the palate feel is rather thin. It's fairly full-scaled, but not particularly graceful, and finishes dry and burnt-toasty, with a briar and tobacco note.",,84,15.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Lake Sonoma
69063,US,"Beaucoup d'oak. Delicious, toasty, roasty, mocha-flavored oak. But the fruit is missing in action. The color suggests that there is some light, plummy fruit underlying all the oak, but it's hiding.",,84,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Zinfandel,Saviez
69064,South Africa,"This light offering shows berry-cherry fruit and an herb note on the nose. The palate is even and dry with bing-cherry flavors, but an evident greenness keeps the wine from blossoming fully. Finishes dry, with a mildly astringent and slightly woody note.",,84,17.0,Stellenbosch,,,Pinotage,Middelvlei
69065,France,"This well-known Burgundy négociant has branched out into the Rhône, like so many others have before.

Would make a nice burger or sandwich accompaniment.",Château De Domazan,84,8.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Mommessin
69066,US,"With its bouquet of black plum, leather and dried herb notes, this lean Zin has good berry fruit. However, its attributes are balanced by a note of volatile acidity on the nose, and it shows some definite heat in the mouth. The narrow, rather angular structure of the wine seems to constrain the blackberry and spice flavors here. Closes with full, fairly even tannins.",Frei Vineyard,84,19.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Gallo of Sonoma
69067,Canada,"A real oddball that's musky, melony, sweet and–yes–bubbly. Vidal is a French-American hybrid with some strange petrolly aromatics that take some getting used to, and they're well-displayed in this example that gets its bubbles from fermentation in sealed tanks, trapping the naturally occurring carbon dioxide.",Sparkling Icewine,84,83.0,Ontario,Niagara Peninsula,,Vidal Blanc,Inniskillin
69068,South Africa,"The right elements are here and show on the nose-berry/plum, a touch of earth and leather. On the palate, though, the wine displays sharp acidity, an angular profile, and tart plum flavors. Finishes lean, and could use more flesh, less bite.",,84,20.0,Stellenbosch,,,Merlot,Longridge
69069,US,"Dark and deep purple/black, with a Port-like nose. There's a little fizz on the palate, which seems odd in a wine this big, and the flavors are locked in tight. Flat, dry, tannic finish.",TC Vineyard Old Vine,84,21.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Sonora
69070,France,"With a nose of spicy green herbs—notably tarragon—and flavors of lemon and pink grapefruit, this no-nonsense blend of 50% Sauvignon Blanc and 50% Sémillon goes down easy and clean. The crisp finish is a good palate-cleanser.",Reserve,84,9.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Blanc,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Marquis de Chasse
69071,France,"From a vintage known for its readily-approachable wines, this grand cru Saint-Emilion shows surprising structure. Some toasty oak frames delicate black-cherry fruit. Black tea notes on the finish carry more tannins than the fruit can handle in the long run, so catch this one soon before it heads south.",,84,20.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Lapelletrie
69072,South Africa,"Earth and wood aromas open to a tart berry palate. The wine has a mildly creamy texture, but the fruit seems clipped with a slight green note. High acidity gives the wine an edgy feel and it closes a bit short, with more tart berry fruit.",Old Bush Vines,84,18.0,Stellenbosch,,,Pinotage,Warwick
69073,US,"A dense purple color, with jammy, grapy fruit. Plenty of extraction, yielding a grapy, fruity wine with a little bit of fizz to it. The wine promises more depth than it delivers; the finish falls off quickly and feels flat.",Story Vineyard Old Vine,84,21.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Sonora
69074,Italy,"Brisk acidity and a lean but smooth profile characterize this taut, somewhat tart wine.  A very inviting vouquet with cherry, cinnamon, clove, cedar, and tobacco notes sets a pretty stage for the palate, but after the great setup the wine delivers rather uninspired and predictable tart berry and sour cherry Barbera flavors.  The sour plum and earth finish is full but quite dry.",,84,10.0,Piedmont,Monferrato,,Barbera,Marchesi di Barolo

69078,US,"A very interesting wine from a rarely-seen appellation. The fruit is distinctly wild berry—huckleberry maybe—with spice and good acid. But the finish has a bitter, metallic note that lingers unpleasantly.",,83,20.0,California,Carmel Valley,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Joullian

69080,US,"Nonvintage juice at an amazing price. It's not going to knock your favorite Zin off the shelf, but as a house pour for spaghetti and meatballs-style cooking, it would do just fine. It has some sweet, tomato-juice flavors and a fair bit of concentration in the finish.",,83,6.0,California,California,California Other,Zinfandel,Barefoot Cellars

69083,US,"A peppery nose, tart wine, with plenty of acid, perhaps too much acid. The mouthfeel is awkward, unbalanced, and the finish is odd. It tastes over-manipulated.",Zin Man,83,12.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Perry Creek
69084,South Africa,"The attractive opening notes of orange blossom and mild spice are quickly overwhelmed by an off-putting asparagus and sulfur note that just doesn't yield. Light on the palate, the wine finishes lean with a pronounced vegetal element. This producer has impressed us with other offerings, but this one misses the mark.",Chameleon,83,16.0,Stellenbosch,,,White Blend,Jardin
69085,US,"Simple fruit and a sweet, almost candied flavor. This wine seems unbalanced. There's an odd hole in the middle, and very little weight or tannin in the finish. It's all forward, sweet fruit, more like candy than berries.",French Camp,82,12.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Buffalo Ridge

69087,France,"I know Bordeaux isn't known for being fruit-driven, but this paucity of fruit in a wine that's 50% Merlot (from a vintage that favored this variety's development) is hard to fathom.

69095,US,"There's a smoky aroma that's almost cigarette ashy, and a distractingly sweet sugary finish to the cherry and cola flavors of this Pinot Noir. Could be going through a dumb phase. Try after 2009.",Graham Family Vineyard,84,50.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,August West
69096,US,"Airfield reds are thoroughly saturated with color, and often quite tannic, to the detriment of the lighter, more subtle fruit.

69102,Portugal,"Although it lacks the creamy crispness of Alavarinho from Vinho Verde, this certainly has the right lemon and cantaloup melon flavors. There is a lift and freshness to it, aided by the tight pear skin structure. The finish is a letdown, though, with a cardboard and green pea character.",Grand'Arte,84,11.0,Estremadura,,,Alvarinho,DFJ Vinhos
69103,US,"Too sweet, soft and simple in cherry-cola flavors, this Syrah would benefit from more dryness and greater structure. It turns Porty on the finish. Drink now.",SLH,84,27.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Syrah,Hahn

69105,Argentina,"Strawberry, cherry and other red-fruits comprise a thin-styled bouquet, and pretty much the rest of the show follows suit. The palate is of medium weight, without much heft or structure. Flavors of red fruits are lean.",,84,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Bodega Norton
69106,Argentina,"Smells like apple blossom and saline solution, and the wet, fresh palate tastes of pineapple and mango. It's a modest Chard in every way, with medium concentration and nectarine and pickle on the finish.",,84,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Bodega Norton

69108,Italy,Here's a reasonably layered Pinot Grigio that offers a candy-like level of butterscotch and dried fruit over fresh notes of peach and passion fruit. The wine is piquant and edgy in the mouth and ends with a citric blast of acidity.,,84,23.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,Pinot Grigio,Conte d'Attimis-Maniago
69109,US,"Pretty basic, a dryly tannic red wine with cherry and herb flavors. Feels hard and sharp in the mouth, with astringent tannins and acids. Could age out.",Athena,84,20.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Dolcetto,Viansa
69110,Spain,"Varietal Graciano is something we frequently see, and very rarely does it bowl us over. This wine has jumpy cherry and lemon peel aromas, and the flavors are tight, a touch sour and run toward cherry and red plum. Fruity for certain, but lacking in charm and mouthfeel.",Viñedo N° 7,84,15.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Graciano,Señorío de Sarria
69111,Spain,"Round, big and medicinal, with clumsy, roasted berry fruit aromas. The palate isn't overly charming, and the flavors of tomato paste, cranberry and herbal red fruit are curious.

69114,Spain,"Baked berry and raisin aromas raise questions about the wine's overall balance, while the plate is sharp and acidic yet tastes of raisin, prune and dried apricots.

69116,Argentina,"Floral, young and jumpy smelling, with gumball aromas that leave you with the impression that the wine's clarity, balance and purity may be tenuous. The palate is raw but fresh, with simple but snappy wild berry flavors. Not a lot of structure or depth here.",,83,9.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tupun
69117,US,"This blend of Marsanne, Viognier and Roussanne has a sweaty note and does not show the fruit ripeness that one would hope for.

69118,Spain,"Is it (MS) or the wine? This vintage of Cáceres rosé seems o.k., but nothing more than a splash across the palate.

Not bad so long as it's fresh, but it's hard to locate much charm or individuality.",,83,9.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Rosé,Marqués de Cáceres
69119,Argentina,"In an attempt to ramp things up, Rutini has a wine that's loaded with candied black fruit, tire rubber and a distinct green streak. The palate is all blueberry and sweetness, but it's short, green and terribly basic. And the feel and finish are narrow and scratchy, respectively. Not one of Rutini's better efforts.",,83,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rutini
69120,France,"Approachable now for its juicy red fruit and intense minerality, this is a superb example of Cornas from a challenging vintage.

Drink now–2014.",,90,,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Syrah,Dumien-Serrette
69121,Italy,"Here is a gorgeous and very fragrant Pinot Bianco with loads of stone fruit, floral and mineral nuances. Spicy acidity livens up the mouth and is fueled by the wine's creamy and smooth consistency (one third is aged in oak). This is a very drinkable wine: Try it with shellfish, pasta, white meat or with appetizers.",Kastelaz,90,21.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Pinot Bianco,Elena Walch
69122,US,"Shows the better side of Paso Syrah, with a white pepper and sweet leather note to the cherry, blackberry and black raspberry fruit.

69123,Australia,"There's a greenish tinge to this wine's fruit, but it also features complex minerally elements, so the end result is something like fresh ferns, crushed stone and fresh-squeezed limes. It's plump in the mouth, yet sharply focused, finishing crisp and refreshing. Imported by USA Wine West.",Watervale,90,29.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Riesling,Grosset
69124,France,"After 30 months in new oak, this needs some time to pull itself together. Right now, it's dominated by oaky notes of vanilla and spice. There does appear to be plenty of old-vine material underneath—you can ferret out hints of apricot and almond skin—so this rating may look stingy in 10 or more years.",Ex Voto,90,175.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Rhône-style White Blend,E.

69126,Chile,"A standout Casablanca Valley Sauvignon for $15? Yes. Right from the start the pure, defined citrus and grass aromas draw you in. After that, the grapefruit on the palate is clean and quenching, while on the fringe there's a hint of pickle and green apple. Overall it's a wine that pushes the right buttons.",Aguas Frescas,90,15.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Chilcas
69127,Italy,"One of Italy's best Rieslings, this is a classic rendition of the variety with trace sweetness and opulent notes of citrus, stone fruit, white mineral and a touch of natural rubber. It ages on its lees in stainless steel for four months, which explains its creamy consistency: very enthusiastically recommended.",,90,18.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Riesling,Alois Lageder

69129,US,"This large vineyard, in the hills of eastern Napa, is source to many wineries, and now Surh Luchel dips into the pot. This is a very good wine, dry and classically structured, with thick but finely ground tannins and ripe flavors of black currants and new French oak. A touch of asperity in the finish warrants against aging.",Stagecoach Vineyard,90,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Surh Luchtel
69130,Chile,"One big step up from the value level is this classy, succulent Malbec from Odfjell, a winery whose successes far outnumber its duds. Expect opening aromas of toasted coconut, black cherry, mocha and even fresh mushroom. The palate is blazing with sweet berry and plum flavors, and then chocolate and coffee take over on the finish. It's the full package in terms of Chilean Malbec; about as good as it gets. Only 254 cases made.",Orzada,90,18.0,Lontué Valley,,,Malbec,Odfjell
69131,New Zealand,"Peg Bay continues to push the ripeness envelope on its Rieslings. The 2006 is honeyed and rather sweet, with baked apple flavors at the core, surrounded by hints of spice and apricot.

69132,Portugal,"The Quinta da Leda is high up the Douro, in the remote regions of Douro Superior.

69134,US,"Soft and generous in fruit, this wine needs a good steak to show its stuff. It's dry, with a gentle scour of tannins framing earthy blackberry, cherry, blueberry, orange zest and oak flavors, and a dustiness that calls Rutherford to mind.

69135,France,"Shows superripe, almost jammy aromas of cherries and plums, but those are balanced by sprinklings of minerals and spice.

69136,France,"From vines more than 50 years old, this is a surprisingly lush, forward Cornas from a vintage known at most domaines for its hard tannins. Black cherry fruit surrounds a core of dense mineral flavors, with light touches of wood on the finish. It's approachable now but should easily hold until at least 2015.",Empreintes,90,,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Syrah,Éric & Jöel Durand
69137,France,"This is a powerful, rich white Hermitage with overtones of buttered nuts. It's slightly waxy, with hints of stone fruit as well. Already shows some hints of age, so this may be best consumed young.",,90,50.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Rhône-style White Blend,E. Guigal
69138,France,"Very spicy, but also possessing enough cassis and cherry fruit to make a wonderful marriage. The lovely velvety texture just turns a tad dry on the finish; give it five years in the cellar.",,90,75.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,Marc Sorrel
69139,Spain,"Dark mineral, toasted French oak and black fruit carry the nose. This is a sturdy, nicely made high-end Rioja, but due to the heat of the year its range of flavors is narrow as it settles on baked plum and molasses. Medium long on the finish, with a lasting taste of chocolate.",Dalmau,90,100.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Marqués de Murrieta
69140,Chile,"Manso ranks among the biggest, most historic and most consistent Chilean Cabernets going. The 2004 isn't perfect but it exhibits classic old-vines blueberry and cassis aromas and flavors. There's not too much obvious oak and the tannins seem a little soft. Which means it's more or less ready to drink now (ahead of the '03).",Manso de Velasco Viejas Viñas,90,32.0,Curicó Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Miguel Torres
69141,US,"Easy to imagine drinking this with a really nice lamb dish or grilled steak. It has an upscale feeling, with a complex interplay of tannins and oak, and the flavors are long, lush and liqueur-like. However, it's soft, and not ageable.",,90,40.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Moon Mountain Vineyard

69145,France,"A delicious and richly creamy wine, full-bodied, with green plum and pink grapefruit flavors. There's freshness, but also power.

69146,France,"A bit light, in the style of the vintage, but with wonderfully intricate spice complexity wrapped around leather and red fruit.

69147,France,"Slightly herbal on the nose, without the great intensity of some vintages, but still having pretty peppered raspberry aromas.

69149,Portugal,"A rare Portuguese Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend, made with the involvement of Bordeaux winemaker Pascal Chatonnet, working with Caves Aliança's winemaker Francisco Antunes. Does it work? Yes, as a delicious curiosity. There is no connection with Portugal, but there is smooth new wood, and some pepper from alcohol.

69151,US,"This wine uses the same Merlot and Cabernet Franc as the superpremium Sorella (due out in the spring), but here the Cab is a younger Champoux block, planted in 1990. Though a blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Cabernet Franc, 15% Merlot and the rest Petit Verdot, the wine expresses itself with a captivating purity. The fruit almost seems to shine with glistening flavors of berries.

69152,US,"A sophisticated blend of 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Syrah, 20% Merlot and 15% Cab Franc; the winery's top wine and very close to the quality of the phenomenal 2002.  The secret sauce here is the river rock on which the vines struggle to produce fruit. The results are evident; along with a few spots on Red Mountain, these rock-strewn Walla Walla vineyards have genuine terroir.

In the mouth it is wonderfully full with white peaches, apricot, citrus rind, hints of gooseberry, some honey and tea flavors also. Long, silky, persistent, clean and pure.

69159,US,"From the winery's favorite vineyard, this limited (242 cases) production, 100% Cabernet is inky black, dense and tannic. Tight layers show many different berries, black cherry, pomegranate and mint. The tannins are ripe and firm, with black tea and graphite flavors. Very fine effort, big but not showy, nor is it a palate-fatiguing high-alcohol fruit bomb. Great fruit from a top vineyard, handled with extreme care and sensitivity.

69177,US,"This is a new brand for me, and they're off to a promising start with this dry, minerally Chardonnay.

69201,Chile,"Sharp aromas mix with softer ones, yielding a conflicted bouquet. The palate is plump as far as feel goes, with pithy flavors, honeyed citrus and lasting green bitterness.

69218,US,"The more I taste Vidal, the more I find it an acquired taste—a taste I've yet to acquire. This one has intense aromas of canned creamed corn, with a few other vegetal hints thrown in for good measure. Yes, it's sweet, with balancing acidity and a rich, lush mouthfeel, but the flavors—well, let's just say they're unique.",Ice Wine,81,18.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Vidal Blanc,Wagner
69219,France,"The nose features some plum and faint cedar aromas, but not a lot of intensity; the light black-cherry and cedar flavors incorporate some earthy nuances on the finish. Light and correct, but where's the beef?",,81,9.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux,,Merlot,Michel Lynch

69222,US,"This wine is still young and precocious, but don't judge it too quickly. Let it air in your glass, and watch how it changes. One minute it's all cherries and smoke; the next it heaves up a great draught of currants, cocoa and cedar. It's a big wine but deceptive; the tannins are airy and lilting, there's charm and underneath, enormous complexity. It's best left alone for a few more years, but it's really very lovely now.",Private Reserve,95,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
69223,US,"Great vineyards, great winery, great vintage: There's lots to like about this big, bold, fruity wine that manages to be complex and elegant at the same time. Masses of blackberry, black currant and violets, with smoke and vanilla from oak aging. What's hard to convey is the balance, richness, harmony and depth of flavor, which are really stunning. Age it for a few years if you want, but it's at or near its delicious best now.",,93,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars
69224,US,"Specially selected lots account for this top-of-the-line bottling. It's really very good. The fruit tends toward raspberries and cherries, and it's smooth as silk in the mouth. The nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon and peppery notes last for a long time on the finish. The difference between this and the typical Carneros bottling is intensity; the fruit is more focused. It's the difference, say, between a flashlight and a laser.",Heritage Reserve,93,30.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Schug
69225,Chile,"A dense bouquet of dark cherries, plum, earth, meat and subtle tobacco pulls you in. It is big in the mouth, yet never brutish, with lovely depth of fruit flavor, earthy accents and great texture. The fine, long finish has even, dry tannins.

69229,US,"Dark, oaky, and fine in every respect. Sonoma Valley, often underrated as Merlot country, lends the fruit a very deep and satisfying blackberry component, which is highlighted, in this case, by toasty oak.

69230,US,"Somehow, this fine winery gets left off a lot of “best of” lists, which makes it a great value, especially from a super vintage like ‘97. This is serious Napa Cabernet, filled with fancy black currant, cassis and mocha, and complex with toasty oak. It's very dry and elegant, one of those wines that fills the palate with the most sumptuous flavors and textures. It's so focused, it's delicious now, but there's no doubt it will age and improve for a long time.",,92,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonegate
69231,Chile,"From Robert Mondavi and Eduardo Chadwick, a Chilean producer (Errázuriz), this wine is a blend of 84% Cabernet Sauvignon and 16% Carmenère. The color is inky dark, and it smells young and intense, almost fiery—there's a suggestion of charcoal and embers. Massive fruit explodes in the mouth, but it's not a fruit bomb; it's much too sophisticated for that. Oak is fancy but not pronounced. Its aging timeline should be similar to that of a great Bordeaux.",,92,60.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Seña

Good stuff.",,91,25.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Blanc,Etude
69234,US,"A very distinctive Chard—full of character and even eccentricity. There are strong, up-front aromas of tangerines, vanilla, butterscotch, smoke, ripe peaches and caramel.

A complex, serious wine.",Shop Block Vineyard Dutton Ranch,91,30.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fritz
69235,Chile,"A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Grande Vidure, 20% Petite Syrah and 10% Merlot, it is as if you can clearly account for each varietal's contribution. Ripe cassis, cherry, plum, and spice flavors are buttressed by well-integrated oak.  Beautifully balanced, it has good acidity and mature tannins, and closes with a long, satisfying finish.

69237,US,"One of the first ‘99 Pinots to come out, this puppy from the Napa side of the American Viticultural Area is young and promising. It shows classic notes of plum, sautéed mushroom, vanilla and smoke, and something earthy, midway between chocolate and leather. The aroma is deep; you can inhale it and feel it in your head. Also heady are the flavors, which are sumptuous, rich and complex, with plenty of fruit and spice, very dry and velvety.

69302,France,"Complex from the first sniff, where it seems herbal, briary and even a bit peppery but simultaneously bacony, spicy and laced with red cherries. On the palate, it's mostly about sous-bois and spice, with just enough cherry fruit for balance. Briary and a bit drying on the finish, but the bet here is that this wine will age superbly.

69315,US,"A fine effort, 100% varietal, that showcases why this grape loves Washington soil.

69339,Chile,"Generally speaking, Errazuriz's progressive wines hit their marks. But this Chard seems to be substituting oak for substance. The bouquet comes straight from the barrel, and the palate is resiny as it houses lemony, baked apple flavors. Finishes as woody as it began.

69347,Chile,"Dark purple in color, with a creamy, candied, berry fruit nose that's potent but not very stirring.

69349,Chile,"Not a bad wine but definitely overoaked for what it is.

69356,Argentina,"Baked apple and buttercup aromas get it going in a good way, but the palate doesn't really keep the momentum.

69357,France,"An interesting Chard that offers quite sweet notes of stewed peaches, orange marmalade and overripe honeydew.

69360,US,"Very much in the vein of a super-oaked, ripe Chardonnay, bursting with peach and tropical aromas and flavors, but with a distinctly nutty, minerally, almost steely note and an electric jolt of acidity.

69361,Chile,"A blend of old-vine Cariñena (60%), Syrah (25%) and Merlot (15%). The color is impressively dark and so is the fruit—mainly plums and blackberries. Toast and dried spices from new oak give an additional impression of opulence. But even more impressive is the balance. This is no low-acid, fruit-and-oak wonder; the natural acidity of the Carignane shines through, giving lift and definition to the flavors. Easy to drink now, but should easily hold a few years.",Cordillera,91,26.0,Curicó Valley,,,Red Blend,Miguel Torres
69362,US,"The workhorse wine from this Pinot master is pretty darned good, especially considering the price. Lovely, deep aromas of black cherry, tobacco, coffee and nutmeg, with a waft of vanilla-tinged oak introduce a wine that is ripe and sweet in the mouth. The vintage was a good one, and the fruit is really succulent. It's not a keeper, however, and it won't improve in the cellar, but it's so good there's no reason not to drink it all up now.",,90,15.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Schug
69363,Chile,"Makes a strong statement for the potential of Chardonnay in Chile, with powerful toast and hazelnut aromas playing opposite fruit comprised of peaches and Granny Smith apples.

Editors' Choice.",Maquehua,90,19.0,Curicó Valley,,,Chardonnay,Miguel Torres

69365,Chile,"Rich and complex from the start, the nose and palate of this wine feature a fruit melange of mango, melon, banana wrapped in nicely integrated oak.

69366,Australia,"Nutty, toasty and tropical-fruit elements are nicely balanced in this wine's appealing bouquet.

Pretty fancy stuff that might even improve with a few years in the cellar.",Wild Ferment La Escultura Estate,90,22.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Errazuriz
69370,US,"Always a bit herbaceous, this year the underlying leanness shows in rather green fruit, veering into bell pepper, dill, mint and oregano. All the oak in France and America can't really make the fruit any riper. But the oak does add smoky, creamy, vanilla notes and sweetness, too. There is some pretty fruit—notably blackberry—in the finish, but still, this is a wine of structure.

69374,US,"Spicy black fruit, with bell pepper, black pepper and toast adding complexity. Partial whole-berry fermentation brings an element of spicy, forward fruitiness to the wine.

69376,US,"Made largely of Cabernet Franc, this wine has all the elements of first-rate Meritage: ripe blackberry and blueberry fruit, accompanied by a blast of smoky oak. It tastes good, too, with pure, sweet, supple berry flavors; yet, it's very dry, with ample acidity. It lacks the focus of North Coast claret-style wines, but is certainly among the best of the genre from the South Coast.",Fathom,89,30.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Babcock
69377,US,"This ripe, lovely wine shows classic Russian River Valley aromas of ripe, sweet, green apples. The winemaking adds smoky, vanilla-scented oak, a creamy, leesy smoothness and a rich softness that owes to malolactic fermentation. What strikes you, though, is the balance.

69382,Chile,"Leafy cassis and cocoa aromas and flavors carry hints of almond paste, saddle leather and ground cinnamon.

Drink now or anytime over the next five years.",Santa Digna,88,12.0,Curicó Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Miguel Torres
69383,US,"Here's a wine with great bones: nicely structured with firm tannins and good supportive acidity. It's not light and flabby, but it is very drinkable. Flavors?

69384,Italy,"Pinot Grigio is more commonly associated with northern Italian regions, but Banfi's Tuscan entry is a solid and fairly full-bodied contender. Lime and herb notes underlay the melon and pineapple fruit, and the mouthfeel is supple, almost rich-unusual for this varietal. The wine finishes positively, with herb and subdued tropical fruit notes. Best Buy.",San Angelo,88,13.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Pinot Grigio,Castello Banfi
69385,Chile,"Bacon and lavender are prominent on the meaty, slightly muddled nose, which unfolds gracefully if given lots and lots of time. Blackberry and some tannins up front, a fairly nice and buttery middle, and finally cola accents on the grapy, heavy, long finish. For years this was C&T;'s top effort, before Almaviva.",Private Reserve Don Melchor,88,40.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Concha y Toro
69386,Chile,"This solid offering hits all the right notes with a cassis and tobacco nose that shows nice depth, a mouthful of blackberry flavors and an attractively smooth, supple mouthfeel.

69388,US,"Here's a Pinot Blanc that's not a Chardonnay lookalike, with its melange of wildflower and tropical fruit aromas. There's something almost Rhône-like in the opulence of its flavors, with chocolate, honey, brown-crushed spice and nectarines in a crisp wine with a long finish. It misses a few points because of a certain lack of complexity, but flavor freaks won't be disappointed by this jolting wine.",,88,15.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Blanc,Valley of the Moon
69389,US,"This is the workhorse release from an always dependable producer, and it's excellent.

69421,US,"What's so nice about this wine is that it has full-throttle Chard personality while keeping everything so balanced that it's also a versatile food wine.

A very nice job.",,90,20.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Robert Mondavi
69422,New Zealand,"Wonderfully forward and fruity, this is simply a delight to taste. Apple and lime aromas are rounded out by just a hint of peach, while the flavors of ripe peaches and apples are kept focused by stabs of citrus.

69424,US,"Tastes like it benefited from being held back for a while, because the tannins are beginning to melt, although they're still dusty and strong.

69428,Spain,"Blackberry and cola are the prime aromas that comprise the alluring bouquet. And as you'd expect, there's also leather and spicy wood thrown in.

69511,US,"Not bad for this vintage, which has ended up thinner than originally thought. The grapes had to struggle to ripen, and you can taste the tension between greenness and sweetness.

69520,Chile,"Sure, cedar and chocolate are the dominant aromas and flavors, but there's enough blueberry fruit to stand up to the oak rather nicely.

69522,Chile,"This individualistic Chardonnay has a lot to offer. The nose is ripe, with floral, honey and even petrol notes and opens to a palate of tangerine and lychee nut-like flavors.

69525,US,"Still dependable despite changes in ownership, this winery again delivers an elegant, well-made wine. With this vintage, it veers more toward herbaceous notes than fruity ones. The dominant flavors are of green olives and sweet bell pepper. Don't think, however, that it's lean. Oak provides fatness, and the right foods, like grilled red meat, will coax out the berry sweetness.",,87,22.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,William Hill Estate
69526,Chile,"A great price for a wine this rich and spicy. It's busting with ripe tropical fruit, peach, tangerine and pear notes, and spices, too.

Offers a long apple-pineapple finish with a butterscotch finale.",Reserva,87,12.0,Central Valley,,,Chardonnay,Portal Del Alto
69529,Chile,"What deep, supple flavors on this soft, delicious wine. The grapes obviously had no trouble ripening, and offer waves of blackberries, plums and black currants, not to mention spices like fennel and pepper. Very dry and fancy, this wine could sit on the best tables and not hang its head. Best Buy.",,87,8.0,Central Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Caliterra
69530,Chile,"A refreshing wine, with nicely ripened fruit and exceptional balance, that's pleasant in every way and a super value, too.  The fruit goes beyond citrus into more deeply flavored apricot and pear, and modest sur lie aging adds creamy, buttery notes.  This is a lovely wine and one of the best values of the year in Sauvignon/Fume Blanc.",La Escultura,87,10.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Errazuriz
69531,US,"A rich, creamy wine, loaded with personality. Spicy, oaky aromas ride over tropical fruit and peach scents, and it drinks crisp and spicy, although the midpalate is a little thin in fruit. The oaky sweetness is very nice, and so is the whistle-clean finish.",Dutton Vineyard,87,22.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fritz
69532,US,"Enough berry and plum richness and smoky oak to satisfy fussy drinkers, yet dry and compact, with a nice shine of acidity. Not too complex or subtle, but there's plenty to like about it. Should be easy to find with more than 30,000 cases produced.",,87,17.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Kenwood
69533,Chile,"Hooray for the fruit on this beauty!  Gobs of freshly crushed blackberries, blueberries, plums, espresso, black currants and vanilla are charming, and the flavors are every bit as lush.  Technically, it's bone dry, but it's one of those wines that tastes fruity sweet.  It has elegance and style that belie the value price. Plus, the tannins are soft as velvet",El Decanso Estate,87,10.0,Curicó Valley,,,Merlot,Errazuriz
69534,Chile,"A light and crisp Chardonnay that leans more to the style of Mâcon than Monterey. Mild apple, peach, tropical fruit and citrus notes on the nose open to a dry, slightly reserved palate with orange and spice elements. Bright acidity keeps it lively and it finishes dry with a classy, slightly chalky note.",Los Vascos,86,11.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Chardonnay,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite)
69535,US,"A little earthy, with plummy aromas accompanied by sun-dried tomato, rhubarb and hard spice notes. The flavors are along the same lines, with cherry tomato, coffee and spices.

69536,US,"With this wine, Callaway takes a step away from its longtime Temecula appellation and toward the increasingly well-regarded Coastal designation.

69537,US,"If you didn't know the price and had to guess, you'd probably figure this wine would cost about $18.

69539,Chile,"Ripe berries, black cherries, earth, chocolate and herbs all mark this nose of this solid Merlot. Fairly full on the palate, it has a supple feel and plum and berry flavors.

69540,Spain,"The previous two years we did not find this wine to be worthy of a rating. This time, we rate it but note that it's an almost-red wine made from Cabernet Sauvignon.

69563,France,"Wonderfully aromatic, this sure-to-be legendary wine offers richness, ripeness, and pure yellow fruits, peaches and apricots, all alongside a structured strain of chalky minerality. It is a wine for long aging, the wood spice just becoming integrated, the fruit still in its first vibrancy. But even now, it fills the mouth with generous fruits, and a great finish of citrus.",,97,,Bordeaux,Pessac-Léognan,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Domaine de Chevalier
69564,US,"The vineyard is in the interior part of the appellation, toward Carneros, and the wine displays the firm, acidic minerality of that cool, foggy region. It has fantastic limpidity. The oak is remarkable for the purity of vanilla and smoky honey, while the underlying flavors of Meyer lemons, pineapples, nectarines and kumquats are decadently good. A masterpiece of Chardonnay.",Stone Côte Vineyard,96,60.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford Court
69565,Austria,"A Riesling that hovers deliciously between Alsace and the German Rheingau. It has the richness of Alsace, but the structure of the Rheingau. And it brings more, because the tight soils of the Hochrain vineyard, with its stony subsoil, brings an intense minerality, which is surrounded by opulent apricot and pineapple fruits. A great wine with enormous potential.",Hochrain Smaragd,95,74.0,Wachau,,,Riesling,Franz Hirtzberger
69566,US,"This is from a block of younger vines made from Dijon clones within the larger Arrendell Vineyard. The wine is quite full-bodied and robust, almost rustic, which is mainly due to the powerful, young tannins. With explosive berry, currant and mocha flavors, this powerful wine should hit its stride in mid-2010.",Hailey's Block,95,60.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court
69567,Austria,"One of Austria's great wines, this intense expression of an imposing vineyard explodes in the mouth. Its perfumed, floral character quickly gives way to a taut, tight mineral structure, a coiled spring with its white fruits, citrus and bright acidity all waiting to race out as the wine ages. Keep for at least five years.",Singerriedel Smaragd,95,126.0,Wachau,,,Riesling,Franz Hirtzberger
69568,US,"Shows the dramatic way that this mountainous region south of San Francisco can ripen Pinot Noir to such perfection. Brilliant in raspberry, cherry, sassafras, mocha, anise and cinnamon flavors, with rich notes of smoky cedar, it shows enough tannins to age it for a few years.",Hicks Family Vineyard,94,59.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Cumbre of Vine Hill
69569,France,"Finely balanced, this has plenty of weight, which shines with the fresh lemon, pear and sweet grapefruit flavors. There is some wood there, but just a hint to give texture. A big success from a fine white wine vintage, and worth aging for 3–4 years.",,94,40.0,Bordeaux,Pessac-Léognan,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Larrivet Haut-Brion
69570,New Zealand,"Weighty and slightly oily in the mouth, this is a big, broad-shouldered Riesling that's completely dry. Apple and spice flavors lack the sweetness you might expect, underlined by lemony notes that impart focus to the wine's finish.",,89,20.0,Central Otago,,,Riesling,Rockburn
69571,Portugal,"Very dense tannins dominate big ripe blackberry jam flavors. The wine is hugely rich, but sustains itself by the structure which is dry, dusty tannin-dominated, with just a hint of fruit. To finish, there are juicy, fresh flavors.",Colheita,89,12.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Portal
69572,Portugal,"The Olazabal/Ferreira family owns two Douro quintas, this and Vale Meão, high up-river. Vallado is in a cooler, wetter climate, and produces elegant wines, in a modern, smooth style. Based on one of the lesser Port grapes, the Sousão, this is full of black currant fruits and new wood flavors.",Sousão,89,38.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Vallado
69573,US,"Crisp acidity and minerality make this wine a great food cohort and attractive to anyone who favors a drier, more delicate style of Riesling. Apple, pear and spice come together in layers, and while refreshing, the wine also contains a lovely creaminess on the palate. A fruity, lingering aftertaste seals the deal.",Dry,89,18.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Dr. Konstantin Frank
69574,France,"Ripe, tropical fruit flavors from super-ripe grapes. That seems to be the way Henry Natter works, and the result is a soft, smooth wine, with a touch of caramel, quince and white peach flavors. The acidity is only apparent towards the end.",,89,24.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Henry Natter
69575,Spain,"For a good price you get a lot of white wine here. Muga barrel ferments this Viura, so there's popcorn and richness to the nose, but it's not overwhelming. And in the mouth, the lemon, orange and tangerine flavors are flat-out lovely. Pour a glass of this with your next platter of sizzling garlic shrimp and you'll be in heaven.",,89,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Viura,Muga
69576,US,"We're almost into Port here, not only in the alcohol level, but the flavors. The blackberries, strawberries, raspberries and cherries are almost raisiny, with that taste of plumped dried fruit, leading to a finish of raspberry liqueur. Yet the wine is dry, as well as tannic. There are certainly few Zinfandels like this anywhere, and you'll either like it or you won't.",Mancini Ranch,89,25.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
69577,Chile,"Light in color, and with alluring true-Pinot aromas of brewed tea, cherry jam and cigar box. The approach Kingston takes is to make something in the California style, and this has the size and richness of fruit to qualify as such.

69579,France,"An interesting wine that combines slightly herbal notes with confected, fruity ones in a harmonious way.

69580,US,"After a shaky start, Ortman is beginning to get its Syrah act together. It's not easy making a high-quality Syrah for this price, but this one manages to do it.

69581,Spain,"Good color and intriguing aromas of baked fruit, tobacco and mint indicate that you're getting some modern-styled ripeness along with traditional Rioja earth, spice and old man's library.

Drinkable now but will age for another five years without a problem.",Limited Edition,89,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
69582,Italy,"What a wonderful treat from Herbert and son Christof Tiefenbrunner. Beautifully fragrant floral aromas mingle gently with kiwi, tomato leaf, exotic fruit and mineral tones from the vineyard's loamy, chalky soils.

69583,Spain,"Ysios is one of the most visually pleasing wineries you'll see. It was designed by Santiago Calatrava and it's the town of Laguardia's modern stamp. But until now the wines were just average. This one, however, is far better than that, with pure dried cherry and raspberry flavors bolstered by spicy oak, vanilla and perfect acidity. Drink now–2009. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Reserva,89,30.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Ysios
69584,US,"Not quite enough Cabernet Sauvignon in this wine to varietally label it, and kudos to the winemaker for blending in Merlot and Cab Franc, which increases complexity.

69585,Chile,"Bold and serious Carmenère at the highest level of extraction and price is what Purple Angel from Montes is all about.

69586,US,"Raymond returns to form with this 100% Cabernet. It's made in the modern cult style, which emphasizes immediate pleasure at the expense of ageability.

69595,Italy,"Enhanced with polished notes of toasted nut and vanilla (the wine sees 12 month of barrique) this is a more austere Pinot Nero with delicate nuances of spice, blue fruit and white mushroom.

Drink now.",Harmonie,89,28.0,Rhône Valley,Saint-Péray,,Rhône-style White Blend,Alain Voge
69598,Spain,"Smooth berries and plenty of dark licorice carry the seductive bouquet. And seeing that this is Remelluri's signature high-priced red, you should expect the fine berry, plum and chocolate flavors that rest comfortably on the palate. But like many '02s, the wine has a hard mouthfeel and pronounced acidity, so it doesn't quite trigger all the pleasure points that it might in a better vintage.",Colección Jaime Rodríguez,89,104.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,"Granja Ntra, Sra. de Remelluri"
69599,Spain,"Bramble bush, graphite, leather and medium-depth fruit are the opening notes on this qualm-free, fairly muscular Rioja.

69603,US,"What I like about Morgan's Pinots is that they avoid the muscularity of certain Santa Lucia Pinots while retaining a ripe opulence.

69607,France,"Starts off with some forceful charred aromas and some rustic, unintegrated notes on the finish, but give this wine some time to settle down and it shines.

69609,US,"You'll want to cellar this young Cab because presently it's too tannic and closed in for pleasure. Yet it has the stuffing to age.

Aromas of baked fruit, compost, tobacco, vanilla and burnt coffee are challenging, while the palate is earthy and tastes leafy as well as sweet. On the positive side, it's neither heavy nor overdone. On the negative side, it's thin and on the fade.",Trumpeter,84,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Merlot,Rutini

69647,Argentina,"A little burnt and rubbery on the nose, but with enough lemon and apple to balance things out. The palate is fleshy and soft, with banana and lemon as the lead flavors. Shows a bit of pithy bitterness late, but overall it's good if you like sweet, warm Chardonnays.",,84,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Bodega Norton
69648,US,"Shows the rustic tannins and ripe to overripe flavors you often find in Foothills Zin, with wild berries, currants and raisins.

69649,Argentina,"Floral but dilute, with mild red fruit scents mixed with herbal fern and juniper aromas.

69650,France,"With a touch of wood, this wine has some good weight to balance the very fresh raspberry and crisp berry acidity. There is a toasty element, but crisp fruit dominates.",Buissonnier Bourgogne Côte Chalonnaise Pinot Noir,84,18.0,Burgundy,Côte Chalonnaise,,Pinot Noir,Vignerons de Buxy
69651,France,"Notes of wet stones and almonds vie with less appealing aromas of French cheese on the nose. The taut, straightforward palate shows lemon flavors and has a slight astringency on the finish. One could do much worse for the modest price.",Réserve,84,12.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Willm
69652,US,"A spicy, chewy, rustic wine marked by crusty tannins and wild berry and raisin flavors. It's also totally dry, at the cost of high alcohol, which is 15.7% and gives it a burn on the finish. In its own way, classic country-style Foothills Zin, brawny and strong.",Old Vine Esola Vineyard,84,32.0,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Bella Piazza

69654,Italy,"Wild berries, white cherry and even a touch of green olive or caper come to the forefront of this delicately colored rosé from Sicily. The wine loses momentum in the mouth, however, because of its bitter, slightly astringent feel.",Herea Frappato Rosato,84,,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Rosé,Avide

69656,US,"A touch on the delicate side with very soft aromas of white peach, melon and barely browned toast. The palate is light but round with ample flavors of apple core, hard nectarine and citrus rind. Fulfilling and enjoyable without being overdone; pair with chicken or crab salads.",,84,14.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay,Keuka Spring

69660,Chile,"At this price, you can expect an honest, workmanlike everyday wine, and you get that here—along with other qualities that will surprise you.

What stands out is the depth of flavor.",,86,8.0,Central Valley,,,Chardonnay,Caliterra
69661,Chile,"There's very juicy, jammy red berry fruit here and the round, even soft palate may lack a bit of structure, but this is a flavorful, very approachable wine.

69662,Chile,"This is a very distinctive, even eccentric, Cab that must reflect its single-vineyard terroir.  The usual black-currant and blackberry notes are there, but the aroma is sharply dominated by an herbal streak, somewhat stalky or green, as if some of the grapes didn't ripen.  Tastes a little sharp.  Purists might want to age it for 3-5 years to see if it softens up.",Don Maximiano Founder's Reserve,86,30.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Cabernet Blend,Errazuriz
69663,Chile,"Young and grapy, with plenty of heavily toasted oak, this is one Chilean red that could use a year or so to settle down. Right now the fruit is just too unformed and the charred oak too unintegrated, but the solid raw materials should knit together nicely in a relatively short time.",,86,9.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dallas Conté
69664,Chile,"Boasts a reasonably complex bouquet of chocolate, cedar and weedy cassis, followed by a mellow, soft palate impression. The fruit is sweet and direct, just the kind of thing that would hit the spot with an impromptu meal of steak frites. No, there's not a lot of structure, but why age a wine that's so clearly made for immediate gratification?",Estate Bottled,86,9.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Ema
69665,Chile,"Richly fruity and soft, this wine boasts loads of black-cherry and plum flavors.

Finishes with a bit of alcoholic heat.",Xplorador,85,8.0,Rapel Valley,,,Merlot,Concha y Toro
69666,Chile,"This is a well-made wine, correct in all respects but decidely light for a Cabernet Sauvignon, perhaps a reflection of the difficult 1998 (La Niña) vintage. However, its attractive flavor package and appraochable structure make for easy drinking with tonight's pasta or pizza.",Reserva,85,12.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Portal Del Alto
69667,US,"The nose seems lean and vaguely unripe. You get aromas of chocolate and green olives, and the most distant whiff of meat. Of course there's a great deal of oak, including American, which lends vanillin and smoky notes, but still an impression of leanness carries through in the mouth. It struggles to say the word “fruit.” It's also very tannic. That aside, it may soften and improve in time.",,85,20.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Newlan

69669,US,"Cabernet Franc, used in Bordeaux blends and on its own in the Loire, is difficult to make into a complex wine in California.

69671,Chile,"Loads of toasty oak, some mild cherry and plum mark this Bordeaux-style blend. The fruit is a bit lean, but the wine has appeal and is reminiscent of classic Rioja in weight and balance—not dense or extracted and maybe a touch woody, but still likeable.",Maxima Claret,85,21.0,Maipo Valley,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,La Playa
69672,US,"Aromas of sun-dried tomatoes, coffee, cinnamon, toast, blackberries and currants introduce a wine that drinks light and fruity.

69673,Chile,"Jammy, soft and juicy, this Cabernet Sauvignon tastes almost like a California field blend. But that's not bad, if not particularly varietally focused.

69678,US,"With a hefty case production, the wine is light and thin, but there are pleasant enough flavors. It's average Chardonnay, with just enough appley fruit, oak and sweetness to satisfy. It's clean and well-made, and there's not much more you can say about it.",,84,15.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,William Hill Estate
69679,US,"A blast of clean, ripe citrus, peach and pear fruit greets you from this well-made, if simple, wine. There are vanilla and smoke elements from wood.

69680,Chile,"Not unlike this producer's 1999 Chardonnay Selection, this Gran Reserva's delivery is all at the beginning.

69681,US,"From a dependable producer and a fine vintage comes a problematic wine. The fruit is nicely ripe and suggestive of apples and peaches, and it's balanced and dry. Acidity is adequate. The only jarring note is a strongly toasted character, almost like charcoal, which you can both smell it and taste. Even the finish is marred by this burnt flavor.",Reserve,84,16.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Clos du Bois

69684,Chile,"A light Chardonnnay showing  pineapple and pear aromas, and similar flavors that turn quite lemony on the palate.

69685,US,"Starts out with Cabernet-like aromas of black currants and an undercurrent of something leaner: unsweetened chocolate, anise, and smoky, oaky notes.

Which makes it a good Merlot value, even though the score isn't very high.",,84,10.0,California,California,California Other,Merlot,Compass
69686,Chile,"With a bouquet of dark plum and toasty oak, with an earthy barnyardy note, this wine from this older Bordeaux grape still cultivated in Chile has medium weight and some plum and caramel flavors. In the end, the wood is a bit much for the fruit, and it is not dissimilar to some Barberas from Italy's Piedmont that wear an overweight of oak.",Reserva,84,12.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Carmenère,Undurraga

69690,US,"The vineyard is near the northwest edge of the Sonoma Coast, a wild, rugged mountainous region whose personality seems stamped on the wine. It's enormously rich in Dijonesque fruit, offering an array of red and black currants, cherries, pomegranates, anise, cinnamon and pepper. For all the opulence, the wine is dry and balanced. But it's just a baby. Hold until late 2010, if you can.",Velvet Sisters,94,60.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court
69691,Austria,"A wonderfully perfumed wine, the floral Riesling character just flying out of the glass. Those perfumes start a wine that has a tight, intense mineral character given a fine edge from acidity. But there are also secondary flavors of dried fruits, spices, violets. The finish is dry, crisp, delicious.",Steiner Hund Reserve,94,88.0,Wachau,,,Riesling,Nikolaihof
69692,US,"A gorgeous Cab that shows the density and concentration, but also the elegant structure, of a fine mountain vineyard. Dry and richly tannic, this 100% Cabernet has pinpoint flavors of currants, plums and cedar.

69693,US,"This Rhône blend from the fashionable west side of Paso Robles is made in the modern cult style. It's very dark in color, full-bodied and glyceriney in the mouth, and delivers a thermonuclear blast of fruit and oak. Among the flavors are roasted blackberries, cassis, melted milk chocolate, anise, cotton candy, vanilla custard, crème brûlée and cinnamon spice. Not exactly your classically dry table wine. Drink now.",Westside,94,95.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,PharaohMoans
69694,Austria,"An impressive wine that manages to bring out both richness and a wonderful shower of fresh flavors. So the ripe pineapple and pear fruits combine with an edge of spice.

69695,US,"This is Terre Rouge's priciest Syrah, a barrel selection of the best lots. It's a big wine. No, make that huge. Godzilla-esque. Just explodes in the mouth with massive flavors of blackberry and black cherry jam, milk chocolate, anise, cedar and pepper. Finishes bone dry, and the tannins are also gigantic, but very finely ground. You need to cellar this puppy.

69697,US,"High acidity marks this vibrant wine, which is from one of Kendall-Jackson's coolest coastal vineyards.

Feels racy and nervy all through, in a delicious way.",Seascape Vineyard,94,65.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford Court
69698,US,"This is the densest, most tannic of Pride's new releases, obviously meant for the cellar. You could drink it now, because it's so lush, but the tightness suggests that the winemaker doesn't want you to. Buried under the astringency are masses of cassis, dark chocolate, sweet fresh herbs and smoky oak. Better after 2010.",Reserve,94,125.0,California,Sonoma-Napa,Napa-Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pride Mountain
69699,US,"There's no Merlot in California that's richer or more decadent than this. The flavors of cherry pie filling, cassis, red currants, chocolate, licorice and smoky oak are totally delicious. Granted, the wine is a little soft, with a melted texture, and classicists will complain it's made in the International style. They're missing out on a real hedonistic pleasure.",Vintner Select Cuvée,94,75.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Pride Mountain
69700,Austria,"Unctuous-textured wine, opulent, with impressively ripe fruit, this starts powerfully and continues that way.

69701,US,"Testarossa reserves their most expensive wines to a best-barrels blend that usually bears a statewide appellation, a practice that is rare if not unique among California wineries. The '07 Niclaire is vast in currants, rhubarbs, cola and cedar, with sizable but finely meshed tannins, and the tart acidity that marks all of the winery's 2007 Pinot Noirs. It's drinkable now, but just barely, so decant. But will benefit from up to six years in the cellar.",Niclaire,94,75.0,California,California,California Other,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
69702,US,"An interesting and different Syrah, and a promising release from a young brand to watch. The wine is very high in acidity, giving it a firm grip. The flavors are tremendously rich, offering a tsunami of blackberries, currants, plum sauce, baker's chocolate, leather, grilled meat, pine nut and black pepper. It's youthfully aggressive right now in tannins, and needs time for all the serious parts to marry. Leave it alone until sometime in 2010, and it should haul for years after.",,94,48.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Heintz

69705,US,"A blend of various vineyards from the far or “true” Sonoma Coast, and also Hartford Court's highest-production Pinot Noir.

Now through 2013.",Land's Edge,94,50.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court
69706,France,"Rich and creamy, this wine has weight as well as the hallmark freshness of 2007.

Screwcap.",,94,49.0,Bordeaux,Pessac-Léognan,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château la Louvière
69707,France,"This is rich, but the balance of the wine is excellent, the wood very much underneath the smooth, opulent apricot and pear fruits.

69708,US,"Delicious doesn't begin to describe this Pinot Noir. Other words that come to mind are serious, important and ageable. Made from the valley's coolest, foggiest “deep end,” it's extraordinarily rich, with explosive flavors of black and red currants, cola, mocha, licorice and cedar. Black Kite has really turned into a Pinot producer to watch. Drink now through 2012.",Kite's Rest Vineyard,94,42.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Black Kite
69709,US,"Testarossa has an incredible track record with Bien Nacido Pinot Noir, and in 2007, they've produced as fine a wine as they've ever done. It's dry, crisp, silky and just wonderful in the mouth, with rewarding flavors of cherries, currants, cola, licorice, sautéed wild mushrooms, balsamic and pepper. Terrific and complex now, and should slowly age for at least sic years.",Bien Nacido Vineyard,94,56.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
69710,Austria,"From Nikolaihof's reserve library collection, this is living, vivid proof of the aging ability of Grüner Veltliner.

This is a wine to savor, to sip and relish.",Vinothek,94,208.0,Wachau,,,Grüner Veltliner,Nikolaihof
69711,France,"Thirteen years on, this is still not remotely mature. It is a major wine, with its still-tight, vibrant acidity and wonderful piercing grapefruit flavors.

69712,US,"Here's a big, sumptuous, fat, oily Chardonnay, massive in tropical fruits, spices, minerals and smoky buttered toast. The creamy texture makes it feel especially rich.

69713,Austria,"This is tight, tense, only just showing potential. It has great fruit, very fresh but also ripe, concentrated, just ready to reveal every facet of its jewel-like nature.

Should develop for a good six years in the bottle.",Hein Vineyard,93,44.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Rockroom Winemaking Cooperative
69716,Austria,"This is Knoll's flagship wine, from the Dürnstein Schütt vineyard. It is powerful, intense stuff, a roll-call of ripe flavors, even in the difficult 2007 vintage. The wine brings out spice, yellow fruits, fresh apple skins and peppered grapefruit. The extra element is the complexity that goes deep into flavors that need to develop over several years.",Ried Schütt Smaragd,93,,Wachau,,,Riesling,Emmerich Knoll
69717,US,"From the winery's Annapolis Vineyard, at the cool, northern tip of the “true” Sonoma Coast, comes this chunky young Pinot Noir. Although the grapes were destemmed before fermentation, the tannins are significant, a reflection of the low yields and tough skins the berries develop. In fact, the wine is almost Zinny in its full body and spicy, briary fruit. It clearly needs time. Best after 2011.",Far Coast,93,70.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court
69718,Chile,"One of Chile's best red blends is back with a vengeance. The nose is a wonderful mix of almond candy, fine leather, baked pastry, prune and licorice all bundled up in a comfortable blanket, while the palate is mouthfilling and loaded with cassis, coffee, herbs and pepper flavors. Excellent structure and depth, with power and balance. Drinkable now but ageable through 2014.",Altaïr,93,65.0,Cachapoal Valley,,,Cabernet Blend,Altaïr

69721,Australia,"In recent years, Schild Estate is making a slew of tasty wines at consumer-friendly prices.

69723,Italy,"Lagrein tends towards plump red cherry fruit aromas but is also an excellent vehicle for expressing territorial and winemaking distinctions.

69725,France,"Made from 70–80-year-old estate-grown vines, this boasts a tremendously complex and seductive bouquet of smoke, violets, raspberries and blackberries. In the mouth, it's a bit less exciting although still very good; it's juicy and fresh, with some firm tannins that are accentuated by crisp acidity.

69726,US,"If you like a purely California approach to Zin, you'll exult in this one. High in alcohol, almost Porty, but totally dry, with stewed raspberry, cherry, cola, mocha and spice flavors, it's tough in tannins, and acidic for so ripe a wine. Will do all kinds of interesting things over the next 10 years, without fundamentally changing.",Zeigler Vineyard,89,25.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
69727,France,"Las Vals is a 600-case bottling of 100% Mourvèdre. It shows plenty of the variety's dark, brooding character, with flavors of chocolate, plum and cola rounded out by a dash of tree bark. Lots of micro-oxygenation has resulted in a creamy, lush mouthfeel, making the wine much more approachable in its youth.",Las Vals,89,23.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Corbières,,Mourvèdre,Domaine Famille Lignères
69728,US,"The blended Pinot is lighter in body and lower in alcohol than the special bottlings, but still features a wonderful sense of balance and plenty of complexity.

Drink now–2015.",,89,42.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Etude
69729,US,"Smooth as velvet, with a good balance of cherries, blackberries, violets and new, toasty oak, this is a luscious Merlot, dry and balanced. The alcohol is below 14%, so it's not one of those chocolaty confections. But it is an elegant, sophisticated table wine that drinks well now and will hold for a couple years.",,89,24.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Merlot,Gainey
69730,New Zealand,"This dry Riesling manages to tie together several disparate elements into a nicely cohesive whole. Strands of honey, baked apples and dusty minerality are all bound together by citrusy acids on the long, clean finish. Drink now.",Dry,89,15.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Drylands
69731,France,"Guigal's Condrieu is a blend of oak- and steel-fermented lots to help preserve some of the Viognier's freshness.

Maddalena/Gries
69734,Italy,"Big in depth and hidden nooks and crannies, this is a fabulously chewy red wine with carefully etched aromas of blueberry, currants, cookie dough, toasted oak and chalky minerals. It would make an easy match to stewed rabbit (use half a cup of the wine in the sauce).",St. Valentin,89,50.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Lagrein,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano
69735,Italy,"This interpretation of Northern Italian Sauvignon Blanc puts more emphasis on a creamy mouthfeel and smooth consistency than it does on bursting aromatics and fragrance.

69736,Chile,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this lighter-styled version of Cabernet Sauvingon, Syrah and Merlot. It opens with weightless flower petal and red-fruit aromas, and the palate meets the challenge with clean plum and berry flavors supported by an undercurrent of creamy oak.

69739,South Africa,"The gripping, earthy flavors of this impressive Pinotage are true to the variety without frightening off fans of softer wine. Pinotage has a tendency toward angularity, but this wine, with its deep leather and coffee flavors and elegant minerality is accessible and, paired with meats like pork or grilled steak, will please palates overall. It needs to age though—at least 4 years.",Hunting Family,89,24.0,Stellenbosch,,,Pinotage,Slaley

69746,US,"Delicious aromas of peach, tropical fruit and spice lead this spirited wine from consistently good Chateau Lafayette, located on New York's Seneca Lake. There's a bright, zippy, and eaysgoing character of citrus and fruit on the palate that recommends this wine for food pairing and just sipping out on the deck.

The flavors are accurate for a claret—mild berry and a touch of earth—and there's even a decent finish. A light quaff; don't expect weight.",Claret,83,10.0,Maipo Valley,,,Red Blend,La Playa
69812,Chile,"Attractive and correct berry, plum and cocoa aromas open to a plummy palate, with a round mouthfeel. The cocoa and toast finish has easy tannins. Has all the right elements, but in a rather simple expression, wanting intensity.",,83,7.0,Maipo Valley,,,Merlot,Undurraga
69813,US,"With a color akin to the soft pink of ripe peaches, this low-alcohol wine has aromas of peach, apricot, watermelon and vanilla. Drinks fruity and simple but clean and zesty, too, with adequate acidity. Off-dry, it gives the impression of some sweetness.",White,83,7.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Montevina
69814,Chile,"With 19% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a deeply flavored, youthful wine, precocious and sharp with acidity, and fresh as newly crushed grapes. The dominant fruits are blackberries and plums, with a hint of bitter chocolate. The tannins are soft and creamy. It's a bit rough around the edges but is well made and gets the job done.",,83,8.0,Central Valley,,,Merlot,Caliterra
69815,US,"From the folks who invented white Zinfandel, a freshly fruity, soft, slightly sweet wine with high enough acidity to keep it from palling. The color is pale pink, and the aromas recall red raspberries and peaches.",,83,6.0,California,California,California Other,Zinfandel,Sutter Home
69816,Chile,"Everything is front-end in this Chardonnay. The nose has plenty of tropical fruit, and with some toasted oak in the background. Decent acidity supports the fruit and the smooth mouthfeel is pleasing, but the wine cuts off abruptly with a somewhat short, resinous close.",Selection,83,11.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Chardonnay,Château La Joya
69817,Chile,"Juicy dark cherry and berry aromas with cedar and cola notes present a Pinot Noir like profile for this wine. It continues the disguise with its cherry and oak flavors, rather light mouthfeel and lack of density for a Cabernet based wine.",Antiguas Reservas,83,13.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cousiño-Macul
69818,Chile,"Lots of cedar is evident on the nose and palate of this red blend. The berry and cassis aromas and flavors are a bit hard to discern and also bear a too-prominent minty, slightly herbaceousness. This medium weight wine closes with a dry tart woodiness that lacks mass appeal.",Finis Terrae,83,32.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Cousiño-Macul
69819,US,"A heavy wine, atypical of the appellation, which usually produces light-bodied and elegant Pinots. There's something earthy and thick about this one, almost rustic. The flavors are fruity but it lacks the delicacy an Anderson Valley Pinot Noir ought to have. And there's an unpleasant sting of acidity.",,83,16.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Edmeades
69820,Chile,A pleasant and cleanly made quaffing wine with plenty of berry and black-cherry fruit and a strong menthol streak running right through to the finish. A bit rough around the edges; might show better with a country-style dish of stewed chicken.,,83,9.0,Maipo Valley,,,Merlot,Santa Ema

69822,Chile,"Red-berry fruit with a heavy dose of herb and bell pepper marks this red blend. The mouthfeel is smooth, but the acidity is high and the wine finishes slightly tart, with a green note. Another victim of this tough year. (We'll look forward to the 1999.)",,83,20.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Red Blend,Primus
69823,US,"A coppery colored, off-dry-to-frankly-sweet wine that's simple, fruity and a little cloying. The dominant flavors are peaches and strawberries, with a very spicy finish, but the acidity seems a bit low. Still, at this price, millions of people will find a lot to like.",Reserve White,83,7.0,California,California,California Other,Zinfandel,Glen Ellen
69824,US,"Here's a nice everyday drinking wine with some real richness from ripe Chardonnay grapes and a touch of toasty oak. It will satisfy that craving for apple and peach-flavored fruit. Dry and spicy, with the creamy texture of a good wine, but it won't break the bank.",,83,10.0,California,California,California Other,Chardonnay,Hawk Crest
69825,Chile,"Orangey aromas wrapped in not very subtle oak open this light-to-medium weight wine. Simple and a bit one-dimensional, it offers light pear flavors and a dry finish. Acceptable as an easy quaff, but not the stuff worthy of reserve designation.",Reserve,83,14.0,Maipo Valley,,,Chardonnay,Santa Ema

69827,Chile,"The pineapple and lemon aromas and flavors in this wine just seem to lack the spark to make them come alive. There's a medium texture on the palate but the subdued, uninspired quality extends to the mouthfeel as well. A reserve label deserves more substance.",Prima Reserva,82,13.0,Maipo Valley,,,Chardonnay,De Martino
69828,Chile,"It's nice to see an ever-increasing number of serviceable kosher wines like this one being made available to consumers from around the world. That said, this one isn't much more than adequate. There's a modest amount of cassis fruit dressed up with earthy chocolate and vaguely minty aromas, but it lacks depth. Still, it's better than the kosher stuff I remember from my friends' bar mitzvahs.",,82,8.0,Maule Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alfasi
69829,US,"A bizarre style of wine. The aromas are Port-like—old Port—with a caramelized, candy-sugar note verging on pie crust. There's also a streak of clove. In the mouth, it's earthy and dense, with tomato flavors and a dash of sweetness from oak.",Lafond Vineyard,82,35.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Lafond
69830,Chile,"Wearing a heavy mantle of rather green, not-too-subtle oak, the fruit in this wine struggles to be noticed. Faintly apple, with earthy notes, it is fairly buried, and the wine lacks the life and dimension on the palate one seeks in a wine with reserve status.",Reserva,82,12.0,Maipo Valley,,,Chardonnay,Undurraga

69832,US,"A light, earthy wine, with violet, berry and tea flavors and a sharp, herbal note verging on grassiness or wet hay. It's very dry and the tannins are soft, but crisp acidity keeps it lively in the mouth.",Coastal,82,10.0,California,California,California Other,Merlot,Callaway
69833,Chile,"This light to medium weight Cabernet has the right profile, but just doesn't seem to come alive. The nose shows blackberry and tobacco aromas and in the mouth there are dried black cherry and spice notes, but they never shine. A soflty dry, slightly woody finish closes the package.",,82,11.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cousiño-Macul
69834,Chile,"An attractive bouquet of pear, orange-lime and floral notes opens this easy, round white. There's a hint of mint and plenty of citrus on the palate, but the fruit is touch too sweet low acid and the mouthfeel a bit fat. Lacks the spine we'd like to see in a top Riesling.",Doña Isidora,82,14.0,Maipo Valley,,,Riesling,Cousiño-Macul
69835,Chile,"Strawberry and wet hay aromas give way to a sweet berry-flavored attack, but the wine turns tart and almost shrill on the finish. A green, stemmy sensation lingers in the mouth, along with dark coffee flavors.",,82,10.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Merlot,Veramonte
69836,US,"Some raspberry fruit in the aroma, but things turn rapidly earthy and herbal, suggesting dried tomato, rhubarb and oregano. The flavors are simple and uninspiring. Soft, mild, rustic and thin are other words that come to mind.",,82,10.0,California,California,California Other,Pinot Noir,Camelot
69837,Chile,"With a vegetal note, some cocoa and berry on the nose and its simple, rather flat flavor profile, this Cabernet suffers from both vintage deficiencies and over-oaking. Dry and woody on the back end.",Reserva,82,12.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Undurraga
69838,Chile,"A light and tart wine, with a bouquet of berry, tea and a touch of barnyard. On the palate, there's more cherry, tea and oak. The fundamental Pinot characteristics are here, but it turns drying and a bit sour on the finish.",,82,7.0,Maipo Valley,,,Pinot Noir,Undurraga
69839,Chile,"Basic Cabernet Sauvignon, with all its goods up front. Opens with some nice cassis aromatics but there’s just not much on the palate. The finish is short and there’s a greenness to the fruit that reflects the tremendous difficulty of the 1998 vintage. Not up to previous efforts.",Medalla Real Special Reserve,82,15.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Rita
69840,France,"A light, floating style from a master of Chardonnay in a top vintage. Flavors of grapefruit, red apples and a fine, dry, tight finish balance beautifully between richness and a taut, dry character.",Le Mont Aimé Premier Cru Blanc de Blancs Brut,93,,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Pascal Doquet
69841,Austria,"Martin Mittelbach rolls out this intense, concentrated wine, which packs spice, ripe pineapple and apricots and a final floral character that fills the mouth. A wine to age for at least four years. Screwcap.",Höhereck,93,40.0,Wachau,,,Grüner Veltliner,Tegernseerhof
69842,Austria,"As this wine gets a few more years behind it, the initial fresh fruit is softening, giving instead a light caramel, nutmeg and almond character. The texture is soft, but full, still a mineral, stony edge, with an underlayer of tight, vivid acidity.",Klausberg Privatreserve,93,,Wachau,,,Riesling,Nikolaihof
69843,US,"This is a very fine Chardonnay. It displays crisp acidity that boosts and brightens ripe flavors of pineapples, pears, green apples and kumquats. Oak adds welcome notes of smoke, buttered toast and spice. Only 25 cases were produced.",Alder Springs Vineyard,93,38.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Chardonnay,Rockroom Winemaking Cooperative
69844,Italy,"Opulence and intensity set this wine apart and place it high on a list of the world's best sparkling wines. Made with creamy Chardonnay grapes, the brilliant bubbly delivers complexity and harmony thanks to its deep shadings of mature fruit, mineral and yeast. Fabulous.",Riserva del Fondatore,93,90.0,Northeastern Italy,Trento,,Chardonnay,Giulio Ferrari
69845,US,"This is one of the few Cab Francs in California that works on its own. It's really a gorgeous wine, showing the full-bodied firmness of Cabernet Sauvignon, but without the tannic weight and density. The flavors veer toward scrumptious red cherries, red currants, milk chocolate and anise, with a dry, complex finish. Lovely with a fine grilled steak and rosemary new potatoes.",,93,60.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Pride Mountain
69846,US,"The vineyard is noted for the quality of its Syrahs, and this one is right up there, although as currently constituted, it's a bit too young. Shows thick tannins and very ripe flavors of blackberry jam, cassis, cherry liqueur, melted dark chocolate, violets and a wonderful appliqué of cedar, finished with crunchy black pepper. Better by the winter of 2009, with slow-braised short ribs.",White Hawk Vineyard,93,38.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,Rockroom Winemaking Cooperative
69847,Italy,"This is an extraordinary wine with deep and delicate layers of yeast, wild berries, rose bud and smoky ash. There is a distinctive wood element that comes off as roasted almond and creamy butter, yet the wine is balanced and seductive to the end. You get personality and the highest quality of Italian sparkling wine.",Soldati Millesimato Riserva D'Antan,93,,Piedmont,Piedmont,,Sparkling Blend,La Scolca
69848,US,"This is a gorgeous young Petite Sirah. Most people will probably drink it soon, because although it's tannic, it's tremendously ripe in blackberries, cherries, chocolate and sweet oak, making it irresistibly delicious. But it should be drinkable for a very long time, slowly changing its profile and becoming ever more delicate.",Serpentine Meadow,93,40.0,California,Guenoc Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Petite Sirah,Langtry
69849,US,"This Bordeaux blend is enormously rich and densely concentrated in mountain fruitiness. It explodes with blackberry, black currant, chocolate, orange zest, roasted almond and sweet new oak flavors, wrapped into extraordinarily fine tannins. Shows a bit of sharpness that could indicate a mild level of volatility. But it's a dramatic wine that should live for many, many years.",Reserve Claret,93,125.0,California,Sonoma-Napa,Napa-Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Pride Mountain
69850,Austria,"The heat of the Pfaffenberg vineyard shows strongly in this wine. This is a big, concentrated waft of yellow fruits, given some spice and finished with a tight pear skin texture. Worth aging, to bring the spice fully into balance.",Pfaffenberg Reserve,93,48.0,Kremstal,,,Grüner Veltliner,Rainer Wess
69851,Italy,"Perfectly balanced and beautifully harmonious, this special sparker from the excellent 1997 vintage delivers vibrant aromas of mature apple, peach, yeast, pineapple and toast. Sophistication and opulence best describe its character and the wine would definitely perform well if served on a special occasion or anniversary.",Cuvée Annamaria Clementi,93,149.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,Ca' del Bosco
69852,Austria,"A full-bodied, spicy style of Grüner that still keeps its sense of minerality and structure. The wine is fruity, its pear flavors dominant at first. But then the concentration and the freshness both deepen the taste and lift it at the same time. An impressive wine, epitomizing both rich Grüner and a taut, cool-climate character.",Axpoint Smaragd,93,74.0,Wachau,,,Grüner Veltliner,Franz Hirtzberger
69853,US,"This is a big, kick-butt wine that shows the powerful fruit and hard tannins that make Pinots from this vineyard ageable. You'll find it tough and gritty now, with rich, deep flavors of cherries, currants, cola and cedar. Best beyond 2011.",Sanford & Benedict Vineyard,93,56.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
69854,US,"Delicious. This is a full-bodied blush bubbly with instant appeal, from the coppery color to the long, spicy finish.

Drink now.",Cuvée de la Pompadour Brut Rosé,93,36.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Domaine Carneros
69855,US,"This is a very good wine, but judging from the acidity and tannins, it will benefit with some time in the cellar. Dry and silky, it shows rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, currants, chocolate-covered mints, anise and cedar that are lush and decadent. Decant now, and should come into its own in mid-2010.",Raffaelli Vineyard,93,59.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Cumbre of Vine Hill
69856,France,"A truly grassy aroma leads to a fresh, herbaceous and crisp wine. To top its crispness, it also has some weight, wood flavors and a creamy core with a white pear texture. It could benefit from aging, at least three years, to bring out the inherent richness of the wine.",,93,40.0,Bordeaux,Pessac-Léognan,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Haut-Bergey
69857,US,"Here's a very good, very generous and rewarding Pinot Noir. Firmed up with crisp acidity and some fairly thick tannins, it nonetheless has a silky, appealing texture, and is vast in red currant, rhubarb, cola, beefsteak heirloom tomato, cedar and spice flavors. Feels important and elegant in the mouth. Best now and through 2013.",Rosella's Vineyard,93,59.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
69858,US,"Made in the Pride style, this is a big, powerful wine that should age well. It's enormously ripe, with flamboyant cassis, cherry pie filling, milk chocolate, licorice and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into thoroughly modern, softly refined tannins. Just beautiful, and should develop through 2012.",,93,56.0,California,Sonoma-Napa,Napa-Sonoma,Merlot,Pride Mountain
69859,US,"Viognier is nothing if it's not rich, and who knows richness better than Bob Foley?

69860,Chile,"Montes Folly is the benchmark by which all other Chilean Syrahs must measure themselves. Yes, it's entirely New World in its approach, but how can you gripe about such a potent brew of balsam wood, tanned leather, licorice, mineral and monster black fruit? The palate is big but balanced by live-wire acidity, and even at 15% alcohol it's harmonious. A real winner; one of the best Folly wines to date.",Folly,93,95.0,Santa Cruz,,,Syrah,Montes
69861,France,"The top white wine from Chantegrive, this is a smoothly wood-aged wine. However it doesn't lose sight of deliciously fresh, herbaceous fruits which come through crisply. That makes the resulting balance immediately appealing, acidity and spice coming together well. Worth aging for 2–3 years.",Cuvée Caroline,92,23.0,Bordeaux,Graves,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château de Chantegrive
69862,Chile,"Lifted, floral and fruity, with cassis, raspberry and balsam wood on the bouquet. The palate is both lush and balanced, and therefore it captures the best of what Chile can offer with Cabernet. Flavors of cassis, plum and chocolate are jazzed up by hints of herb and leather, and overall it's right where it should be. Drink now through 2012.",Le Dix de Los Vascos,92,50.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Blend,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite)
69863,US,"A beautiful young Pinot Noir, gorgeously structured in acids and tannins, and intricately layered.

Just lovely with a great steak.",,92,49.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Cumbre of Vine Hill
69864,US,"Good for Cinnabar for holding this Cab back a while, to let it develop in the bottle. Although it's still pretty tannic, it has entered its drinkability window. Dry and full-bodied, it shows classic flavors of black currants and smoky cedar, with a long, impressive finish.",,92,45.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cinnabar
69865,France,"One of the oldest vineyards in Bordeaux, founded by Pope Clément in the 14th century. This white is full, rich, packed with white fruits. It shows crispness, toast and spice, already well integrated.",,92,,Bordeaux,Pessac-Léognan,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Pape Clément
69866,Italy,"This is a lovely and impressive sparkler with luminous intensity and more than a decade of careful aging. Aromas recall cedar wood, pineapple, apricot and hazelnut.

69867,Austria,"You can feel the richness of this wine as it rolls opulently around the mouth. The Grüner spice character is dominant, giving intense concentration to go with the yellow fruits. Acidity is a balanced addition to the mix on this impressive wine.",Loibenberg Smaragd,92,50.0,Wachau,,,Grüner Veltliner,Alzinger
69868,Austria,"Concentrated, firm, touched by caramel, this wine starts out intensely fruity. Then texture, mineral and fruit skins come in to play. The wine is impressively complete, its acidity ratcheted up a notch by the fine floral, green and white fruit flavors.",Steinertal Smaragd,92,60.0,Wachau,,,Riesling,Alzinger
69869,US,"Shows the soft tannins and slight herbal quality of a top Alexander Valley Cab, along with low-yield mountain concentration of red and black currants, mocha and spice. Drink this polished, supple wine through 2012.",Highland Estates Hawkeye Mountain,92,60.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kendall-Jackson
69870,Australia,"The idea behind the delayed release of the Steingarten Riesling is that the wine needs time to show its best. This is a broad-shouldered, muscular Riesling even five years after the vintage, showing off smoky, dieselly notes to go with hints of honey and citrus. Spicy and minerally on the finish. Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.",Steingarten,88,25.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Riesling,Jacob's Creek
69871,Germany,"Although the aromas of this wine are largely neutral, showing just hints of apple and citrus, the flavors come alive on the palate, offering up ripe apple, lime, nectarine and spice notes. It's slightly oily in texture, finishing softly tart, accented by dried spices.",Oppenheimer Sackträger Spätlese Trocken,88,26.0,Rheinhessen,,,Riesling,Louis Guntrum
69872,Chile,"Light in color but lively in its aromas of lettuce, half-sour pickle, fresh asparagus and passion fruit. The palate is zesty and jumpy, with lemon-lime flavors, passion fruit and a touch of minerality. And the finish is quite long for Sauvignon, a direct reflection of the wine's heft and 14.5% alcohol.",Cariblanco,88,16.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Kingston Family
69873,New Zealand,"Sort of a second label from Pegasus Bay, Main Divide's 2005 Riesling is made in a slightly sweet style that recalls some weighty Rheingau spätlesen. Baked apple and clover-blossom honey are perked up by the addition of lime and petrol. Drink now.",,88,18.0,New Zealand,,,Riesling,Main Divide
69874,US,"One of the few California wineries to focus on this variety, Stevenot's efforts are really paying off. Marked by high acidity, the wine shows exotic pineapple, lemongrass, kiwi, white pepper and vanilla flavors, and is thoroughly dry. Try as an alternative to Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio.",,88,10.0,California,California,California Other,Verdelho,Stevenot
69875,South Africa,"This rich, ruby-colored red goes in the softer, smoother direction for a Pinotage, making it more appealing to American palates. The dry, spicy Pinotage character is still present, but it's rounded by a softer, fuller blanket of pretty fruit. Simonsig gets it right and this wine will pair well with grilled meats or can be enjoyed on its own. Hold for aging. Imported by Quintessential Family of Wines, LLC.",Redhill,88,30.0,Stellenbosch,,,Pinotage,Simonsig
69876,Italy,"What sets this wine apart is the intensity of its aromas: Citrus blossom, creamy lime and honeysuckle are immediate and generous, almost pungent. This showcases many of the prized characteristics associated with the Friuli region of northeastern Italy, which is home to some of the country's most elegant whites. The mouthfeel is rich, refined and silky but there is enough fresh acidity to keep it lively and cool. Pair it with delicate dishes like sea bass or lake fish.",,88,22.0,Northeastern Italy,Friuli Isonzo,,Riesling,Ronco del Gelso
69877,France,"Starts off with aromas of petrol, paraffin and melon. On the palate, pineapple, under-ripe stone fruit and lemon pith complement the full body. The medium length of the citrusy finish brings it all together nicely.",Réserve,88,17.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Pierre Sparr
69878,Portugal,"Ramos-Pinto's benchmark wine, a classic in the Douro, made from the two quintas of Ervamoira and Bons Ares, is as good as ever.

69880,Chile,"Dark and just a touch herbal and green on the nose, but overall it's a pretty, beefy blend of Syrah (60%), Cabernet and Merlot that should win over even the most discerning of critics. The palate is balanced and features a rich, comfortable feel. And the finish is crisp but also long and rewarding. For $12 there's not much you can gripe about.",Reserve Assemblage Syrah,88,12.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Red Blend,Estampa
69881,New Zealand,"A blend of fruit sourced from Canterbury and Marlborough, Giesen's 2005 Riesling is an excellent value in off-dry Riesling.

69882,US,"It's all about fruit and softness in this Syrah, which has a little Mourvèdre, Grenache and Petit Verdot, of all things.

69883,US,"This is a new winery for me, and it's a promising start. The wine is decadently rich in cassis, cherries, milk chocolate and vanilla flavors, but it has the structural integrity of a fine wine. While acidity is soft, the tannins have the grip of cherry skins, while oak adds its own tannic complexities.",Mountain Cuvee,88,28.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hans Fahden
69884,France,"Starts off with some hints of sour plums and cinnamon, then adds hints of blood and meat. Because of the vintage, it's a bit light, but spicy and complex, with surprising length. Drink now–2015.",,88,,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Syrah,Cave de Tain
69885,Italy,"The appearance is marked by brilliant, ruby luminosity and its consistency warms over the palate with delicate flavors of violets, lavender and forest berry.

69887,South Africa,"Wine has been made on the Beau Joubert property since the early 19th century, and today, the Joubert family makes consistently good wines that flourish in the mineral-rich soils of the Stellenbosch farm.

69889,Portugal,"From Ferreira's own vineyards in the Douro, this smooth, ripe, wood laden wine is spicy, with blackberry fruits, a shot of dark tannins, and fresh, juicy acidity. Age for another 2–3 years before drinking.",Vinha Grande,88,20.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Casa Ferreirinha
69890,Chile,"Tobiano in 2005 is preferable to Kingston's 2004 Bayo Oscuro Syrah. This wine has more lift, fruit and balance.

Not your average New World Syrah; it'll make you think.",Tobiano,88,18.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Syrah,Kingston Family
69891,France,"Peppery and meaty, with stewed plum flavors, this is much more muscular and tannic than Colombo's Côte-Rôtie, yet still lacks the spark seen in his top Cornas bottlings.

69892,Australia,"This shows a bit of Graves-like character, blending tobacco-leaf and smoky-cedary hints with black cherry and cassis fruit. Medium-bodied, this doesn't have the lushness of many Australian wines from warmer regions, yet isn't overly hard. Try in 2010.

69894,US,"Shows all the hallmarks of a good vintage, with terrifically ripe cherry pie, cassis, milk chocolate and smoky, vanilla-infused oak flavors. There's adequate acidity, although the wine ultimately feels soft and could use a little more crispness. Made in a crowd-pleasing style, it trades off complexity for immediate pleasure.",Bien Nacido Vineyard,88,35.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Stephen Ross
69895,US,"Stylishly dry, with acidic citrus, green grapes skin and lime-zest flavors that are zesty on the palate. Twenty percent barrel fermentation and sur lie aging provide a touch of vanilla cream and tastebud-stimulating sourness. A wine that will showcase food without overpowering it.",,88,15.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Robert Hall
69896,US,"Few make a separate bottling of Petite Verdot, but in the right hands, as it is here, it lends itself to a nice alternative to Cabernet. Dry, full-bodied, tannic and complex, the wine is weightier than Cabernet, with blue and black stone fruit and unsweetened dark chocolate flavors, and a tanned leather animality. But it's soft, so drink now.",,88,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Petit Verdot,Rutherford Hill
69897,Chile,"Three years into this upper-level project from Francesco Marone of Italy and we're still waiting for that blockbuster success. The 2004 is a very good wine with darkness, licorice and coffee aromas backed by red berry and plum flavors. It has a ripped mouthfeel and structure, but it's also a touch tart at its core. Will 2005 offer more?",Erasmo,88,27.0,Maule Valley,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Caliboro Estate
69898,Spain,"A little bit leafy and light, but that's traditional Rioja for you. The color is a mix of orange and red, while the palate of snappy red fruits is beginning to slip toward peach and nectarine. If you like a leaner, racier style of wine, then drink this now. It's probably at its peak.",Faustino I Rioja Gran Reserva,88,30.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino

69902,US,"This winery's regular '03 Syrah is a sensation. The Califa bottling is clearly a different wine, more tannic, deeper, darker and more brooding. It's also sweeter, although it's not clear if that comes from riper fruit or more new oak. Either way, this taster prefers the regular Syrah.",Chamisal Vineyard Califa,90,42.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Domaine Alfred
69903,US,"The Cab is matched against Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot in a slightly less intense version of the becoming quite fashionable in Washington State. The best percentage seems to be about 60% Cab to 40% Syrah, roughly the blend here, which contrasts the Cab's firm, tannic, lightly herbal character with the tart blueberry and winery's exceptional Intuition reserve.

Well crafted and quite interesting.",,90,21.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Waterbrook
69912,US,"The immediate impression is of extreme youth and mandatory cellaring. Bluntly, this is not an easy wine to like now.

Impressively light and elegant, it displays some unusual elements and has a fine bead as well as a supple, herb-tinged finish.",Cuvée President,91,37.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,H.Germain
69980,Italy,"Rich and mature aromas of smoke, earth and herbs announce this surprise. The palate offers complex fruit, herb and mineral notes, and while mature, it has great mouthfeel and acidity. The dry finish has length and shows a reprise of the smoke and mineral elements from before. Best Buy.",Brut Riserva,91,19.0,Northeastern Italy,Trento,,Champagne Blend,Letrari
69981,France,"Shows some older notes: a bouquet of toasted white bread, cinnamon, brown sugar and smoky yeast, with just the slightest hint of white pepper. Really rich and complex, with supple lime flavors offsetting the earthy impression. Very dry, with an overall excellent palate impression. Should continue to age and grow finer.",Blanc de Blancs Brut Mosaïque,91,38.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Jacquart
69982,Italy,"Made by 30-ish Roberta Borghese high above Manzano, which also happens to be the chair manufacturing capital of Italy, this is a perfect example of how good Tocai can be. The aromas are honey and grapefruit-orange. After an intro of crisp acidity, the same flavors appear and persist on the medium body. Match this one with a good seafood risotto.",Superiore,91,,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,Tocai,Ronchi di Manzano
69983,France,"Rich and toasty, with tiny bubbles. The bouquet is laced with honey and vanilla scents. The palate suggests nuts and toast, without any noteworthy sweetness despite the demi-sec label. There’s good concentration and a ripe, toasty, slightly oxidized, nutty finish. This would work perfectly with the usual Champagne food suspects: foie gras, triple-cream cheeses and pâté, though it’s probably not the best choice for oysters.",Demi-Sec,91,30.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Jacquart
69984,France,"Really fine for a low-acid vintage, there's an intriguing nose here with white pepper, sandalwood and pine-nut elements. There are mature notes to the apple, toast and pepper flavors, good backbone, and the texture is just lovely. This well-developed example still has youthful elements, and closes with a grapefruit-mineral finish that is both relaxed and complex.",Diamant Bleu,91,70.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Heidsieck & Co Monopole
69985,Italy,"Many people feel Fiano represents southern Italy’s most promising white grape, and after tasting this rendition, who can argue? The flavor package is pineapple, citrus and wet stones. The structure and mouthfeel are what many Italian whites strive for but never reach. An elegant wine.",,91,20.0,Southern Italy,Fiano di Avellino,,White Blend,Feudi di San Gregorio
69986,France,"Offers an intriguing nose with ginger, lime and floral elements. The mouthfeel is ephemeral—almost too light—but there’s a good case to be made for this style when bubbles are involved. Green apple, an almost lilac note, and lime on the palate. Finishes nicely, too.",Cuvée Prestige,91,27.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,H.Germain
69987,Italy,"This classic example comes from a cru vineyard called Terre di Dora, which is named after the Mastroberardinos’ mother. They should all be proud of this one. Wet stones, apples, peaches and pears start it off. On the palate, the structure and mouthfeel are nearly perfect. The finish features the butterscotch tones of malolactic fermentation. A wonderful example of what Fiano di Avellino can be.",Terre di Dora,91,20.0,Southern Italy,Fiano di Avellino,,White Blend,Terredora
69988,France,"A perfect salmon shade, with scents of peaches, cherries and toast. It hits the palate with big, ripe, fresh fruit: crisp apples, peaches, cherries and citrus. Concentrated and full, with a tart, fresh back end that lingers into a cherry-vanilla finish.",Grand Brut Rosé,90,52.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Gosset
69989,Italy,"More Pinot Grigios should taste like this. A rich pear-like nose is followed by crisp acidity, a medium body and a viscous mouthfeel. The finish is long and redolent of pears and citrus. And all for $15!",,90,15.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Pinot Grigio,Alois Lageder
69990,France,"Easy to drink with plenty on offer to keep you interested. The nose suggests essences of beeswax, honeysuckle, pear and citrus with the palate conjuring flavors of ripe red apples and baked peaches. Medium-full body and intensity bring the wine into focus while the delicate fruity finish closes nicely.",Herrenweg,88,19.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Domaine Ehrhart
69991,France,"Made from young vines, giving fresh, but soft flavors. While the concentration may not be there, this makes a delicious light apéritif style, all fruit and crispness.",Le Clos de Bannon,88,22.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Fouassier
69992,Italy,"There's a playful touch of smoky toast and dusty minerality that adds a deeper dimension to this modern and beautifully constructed wine (one third is aged in barrique). Pair it with leafy greens, seafood and white meat.",Castel Ringberg,88,21.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Sauvignon Blanc,Elena Walch
69993,Chile,"If oak is your thing, this has plenty of it. The nose is heavily toasted and the palate is loaded with cinnamon, nuts and wood spice. But in between the layers of oak there's nectarine, peach and tropical fruit flavors that are of high quality. Drink as soon as possible; the wine is beginning to soften and lose its snap.",Marques de Casa Concha,88,19.0,Pirque,,,Chardonnay,Concha y Toro
69994,France,"This is spicy and herbal but also loaded with cherry fruit, made with grapes grown not far from teh family's Côte-Rôtie vineyards. It's a bit light in body, but nicely savory and true to its northern Rhône origins, with enough structure to hold for 2-3 years.",La Rosine,88,35.0,Rhône Valley,Vin de Pays des Collines Rhodaniennes,,Syrah,Michel & Stéphane Ogier
69995,US,"Made New Zealand style, with no oak to influence the gooseberry, grapefruit, lime, green grass and vanilla flavors.

69996,France,"Alain Cailbourdin makes three different wines from his three vineyards. Les Cornets is the softest of the three, a pleasingly ripe wine that offers almonds, green herbs, full quince and kiwi fruits.",Les Cornets,88,,Loire Valley,Pouilly-Fumé,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine A. Cailbourdin
69997,France,"Sorbe is one of the leading figures in the two small appellations of Reuilly and Quincy. His Reuilly is honeyed, with fresh mandarin and citrus flavors, leading to a soft, open wine, great as an apéritif.",La Commanderie,88,14.0,Loire Valley,Reuilly,,Sauvignon Blanc,Jean-Michel Sorbe
69998,Australia,"Nicely blends ripe peaches with wet stones to give a wine that has something for fruit- and rock-lovers alike. It's medium- to full-bodied, finishing with accents of dried spices. Drink now–2010.",,88,15.0,Western Australia,Great Southern,,Riesling,Plantagenet
69999,Spain,"Fans of big, blocky reds that offer punch, extract and tannins should jump on this now, and then watch it age nicely for the next four or five years. That's the type of meaty, tannic, fruit-infused Tempranillo this is. It's always going to be short and stocky, but still it will round into shape as it matures.",Crianza,88,19.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Ostatu
70000,France,"Starts off with oaky notes of vanilla and spice, but then folds in slightly bloody, peppery notes. It shows plenty of red currant fruit, and is fairly powerful, yet with crisp acids and firm tannins. Hold five years.",Les Grandes Terrasses,88,57.0,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Syrah,Paul Jaboulet Aîné
70001,US,"I dislike sweetness in Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio and other whites that should be dry, but there's something about Riesling that makes it work. This one is perceptibly sweet, yet it's luscious. Acidity helps balance, and the flower blossom, green apple, peach, mineral and petrol flavors love that honeyed edge. Just lovely, and a great buy.",,88,10.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Riesling,Mandolin
70002,France,"A blend of barrel- and tank-fermented wine, this is an attractively floral and fresh Viognier intended for early drinking. There's a hint of honeyed richness to the apricot and pineapple flavors, but it finishes clean and refreshing. Drink now–2008.",La Rosine,88,35.0,Rhône Valley,Vin de Pays des Collines Rhodaniennes,,Viognier,Michel & Stéphane Ogier
70003,Chile,"Floral and dark, with char and tar adding masculinity to the bouquet. The palate is juicy and balanced, with blackberry as the prime flavor and tobacco and pepper adding nuance. Finishes with a cushy feel and warmth, and overall it sings a nice tune.",Reserve,88,12.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Malbec,Montes
70004,Spain,"Early leather and animal aromas soon yield to brighter fruit scents, and that's followed up by a palate detailed by cherry and plum flavors. This nice, comfortable wine offers freshness and texture; it's a very good crianza that nails the relationship between fruit and oak.",Crianza,88,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Loriñon
70005,Germany,"Rather full and round in the mouth—the combined effect of 12.5% alcohol and a touch (0.6%) of residual sugar—this nevertheless does taste pretty dry. It's a minerally version, with smoky minerality and powdered—almost liquified—stone notes fleshed out by hints of tangerine and peach. Drink now.",Dry,88,12.0,Rheinhessen,,,Riesling,Louis Guntrum
70006,Spain,"A heavier, more elevated style, but still well-priced relative to the competition. Expect lusty toast and berry aromas along with a round but juicy palate that delivers chewy berry and plum flavors and some “grasa,” which means fat in Spanish. A cut above most wines in this price range.",Seis de Luberri,88,14.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Luberri
70007,Portugal,"A huge wine, full of soft fruit. The layers of tannins sit gently on the plum and cassis fruits, lifted by acidity. If it wasn't 15.5%, this would be impressive, but the high alcohol makes the wine very Port-like, giving an extra layer of pepper from the alcohol.",,88,20.0,Douro,,,Touriga Nacional,Quinta do Portal
70008,France,"Bottled only three weeks prior to review, this wine may have been suffering a little when it was tasted last May. There's a bit of spice, but the wine just isn't that expressive, showing crisp and tight, with some raw tannins on the finish. Seems to have potential, so hold five years or more before trying.",,88,90.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,Domaine du Colombier
70009,France,"With its scents of cherry preserves, spice and leather, this is a more approachable wine than proprietor Stephane Robert's 2005. The lower acidity gives it a sense of lushness, but it's also slightly less concentrated and intense. Drink now–2014.",,88,,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Syrah,Domaine du Tunnel
70010,France,"This grand cru selection seems to have a bit of everything. Essences of mint, honeydew and apricot are perfectly integrated with flavors of apple, citrus and honey, creating a broad mouthfeel that's coating without being too heavy. A crisp clean finish cuts through the heft to prevent it from falling flat.",Schlosberg Grand Cru,88,30.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Domaine Ehrhart
70011,Germany,"Off-dry, as expected from a halbtrocken, marrying stony, underripe peach notes with hints of oil and honey. The combination of sugar and tartness gives it a tangy finish.",Hochheimer Stein Kabinett Halbtrocken,88,17.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Domdechant Werner
70012,US,"Cuvaison does another good job of producing a fine Syrah from their Carneros vineyard.

Drink now for its youthful vivacity.",Estate,88,30.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Syrah,Cuvaison
70013,US,"Solid Syrah, round, smooth and fruity, with a nice bite of tannins and acids for balance. The blackberries, cassis, coffee, carob, cola, tobacco and peppery spice flavors finish impressively long.",,88,32.0,California,El Dorado,Sierra Foothills,Syrah,David Girard

70015,France,"Makers of more forward Cornas, the Durand brothers' Prémice bottling is easy to drink right away, even in a tannic vintage like 2005.

70016,US,"Ripe fruit balanced with a zingy backbone make this semi-dry Riesling from Dr. Frank an overall winner for varied palates. Melon, pear and a hint of exotic floral flavors set the wine aside from standard whites of this type, and its structure—balanced and substantial without being heavy—further recommend it. Chilled and in an elegant glass, this is a fun and affordable wine with character.",Semi Dry,88,16.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Dr. Konstantin Frank

70018,US,"This is from a vineyard high in the Mayacamas on the Sonoma side of Diamond Mountain. The wine was made by Marco DiGiulio, a well-known consulting winemaker in Napa Valley. It's a big, thick 100% mountain Cabernet, intense in cassis, dark chocolate and new oak, and an interesting hit of Provençal herbs. It's also high in alcohol and low in acidity, which may inhibit ageability.",,88,75.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hidden Ridge
70019,Chile,"Nice pepper and cola aromas on this small-production Cabernet from the Lurton brothers. It has stylish fruit but also some leather and depth.

Imported by Tosco Wines.",,90,,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Tenuta Crocedimezzo
70024,Argentina,"Fully oaked, so the nose deals plenty of coffee and maple. Under that there's vibrant red-cherry and cassis flavors amid firm tannins.

70026,Australia,"Accented by new French and American oak, this is a rich Chardonnay. Aromas of nut and grilled meats are echoed on the palate, giving interest to pear and citrus zest notes underneath.

70036,US,"Dramatically structured and flavored, this is a tough, young mountain wine that deserves to be cellared.

Give this wine four or five years to soften.",,90,35.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Terra Valentine
70037,US,"Here the blend is 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 29% Merlot and the rest Cab Franc. Winemaker Chris Camarda captures pretty fragrances of strawberries, light cocoa and hints of ham.

70064,US,"Awkward and rustic. Although it's entirely dry, it has a sweet, pastry-filling cherry taste, with an edge of raisins. And the texture is sharp and green.",,82,35.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Romililly

70066,US,"Some initial notes of paint thinner and rubber blow off to reveal an intriguing mix of blueberry, vanilla and mocha on the nose. It's dense and sculpted in the mouth but turns a tad sour at the back of the mouth and ends on a note of dry tannin. A year or two in the cellar may help bring some harmony to this rather disparate wine.",R,82,48.0,Virginia,Virginia,,Meritage,Rappahannock Cellars

70068,US,"Nice and drily acidic, with a minerally, citrusy mouthfeel. That's good, but there's a touch of dirtiness, a moldy taste that lowers the score a lot.",Union Island White,82,15.0,California,California,California Other,White Blend,Bixler Vineyards
70069,Austria,"Very candy shop in its aromas and flavors, a wine that is flagrantly perfumed and touched by wood. The wine is so spicy and perfumed that it is hard to discern the fruit.",Contessa,82,35.0,Burgenland,,,Chardonnay,Giefing
70070,Italy,"There's a touch of red apple skin or apple sauce at the start that is followed by slightly awkward notes of bubblegum and cotton candy.

70071,US,"A hard wine to like. It's acidic and raisiny, and despite the official alcohol reading of 14.7%, tastes far higher, with a hot, chile pepper burn.",Clockspring,82,16.0,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Amador Foothill Winery
70072,France,"This Riesling will suit fans of neutral Italian whites. The nose is shy and retiring while the palate is light on its feet, with notes of lemon and wet stones. Bracing acidity, making it a good partner with light fish dishes.",Reserve,82,22.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Jean-Baptiste Adam
70073,Chile,"There isn't a whole lot of good going on here. The nose is cheesy and smells of animal hide and leaves, while the palate is far too acidic, which puts a tight, dry, sour spin on the wine's cherry and raspberry fruit. Sharp and angular on the finish as well.",Reserva,82,13.0,Maule Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hugo Casanova

70081,Italy,"This wine boasts beautiful purity of aromas, starting with crisp citrus, lime, kiwi and cut grass before evolving to reveal layers of almond blossom and white mineral.

70082,Chile,"As in the past, this blend of 51% Syrah and 49% Cab is rock-solid, with tight, tough herbal-olive undertones supporting spicy dark fruit and road tar aromas.

70084,Portugal,"A hugely rich wine, packed with dried fruit flavors and spice from aging in American oak.

70085,Spain,"Bouquet is nice and smooth, with an earthy warmth surrounding scents of purple flowers and crushed berries.

70086,Spain,"Alert and snappy on the nose, with no “hot” or stewy characteristics from the steamy year.

70087,Chile,"Chilcas is a new-to-us label that seems to be on the right path. This Sauvignon is round and melony, with fresh aromas and zesty flavors of grapefruit, kiwi and tangerine.

70088,Spain,"Stout and generally quite pure, with aromas of leather and berries that thicken and gather density with airing.

Drink now.",No. 19,88,20.0,New South Wales,Orange,,Sauvignon Blanc,Philip Shaw
70090,France,"Slightly schizophrenic, this wine touts a strange but intriguing gamut of aromas and flavors. The nose presents mild vegetal and ashy powder notes while the palate offers more typical nuances of nectarine and lemon.

70091,US,"Dark and dramatically rich, with blackberry jam, cherry-pie filling, milk chocolate and cinnamon spice flavors, this polished wine has gorgeously fine tannins. It could use greater acidity for structure, though, because it's very soft and melted, which makes all that fruit taste sugary sweet.",Old Vine,87,25.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard

70093,Chile,"Nice cherry and raspberry aromas work the front end, while the palate is defined by simple but ripe berry and red plum flavors.

70094,France,"The 15th generation of the Clément family to farm in Menetou-Salon, just to the west of Sancerre, makes an elegant Sauvignon Blanc which in its youth shows signs of lees contact and a lightly nutty character over its green fruits.

70096,New Zealand,"From a small Bannockburn winery, this is an idiosyncratic Riesling that's fun to taste. To begin, there's a slightly vegetal note to its aromas and flavors that's not dissimilar from corn or vegetable oil. This is given focus by powerful citrus notes and complexity through a pinch of dried spices. Off-dry, but it finishes crisp, suggesting it would be a fine partner to sweet-fleshed crustaceans like shrimp or prawns.",Last Light,87,28.0,Central Otago,,,Riesling,Bald Hills
70097,US,"Genesis is Hogue's upper-tier line, made in much smaller quantities than the regular wines. In effect, it tries to be a sort of reserve, selecting the best lots from the best vineyards. Here it only partially succeeds in eclipsing the much less expensive regular Riesling. This has more mass and concentration, but seems a bit heavy and fat, and loses some of the delicacy in the finish.",Genesis,87,15.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Riesling,Hogue

70099,US,"Fortitude is a new brand produced at the Etude winery aimed at expressing the grape growers' original intentions. This is an old-style field blend of Charbono, Zinfandel, Carignane and Petite Sirah grown up-valley, near Calistoga. Lovely dark fruit and spice aromas include a few turns of cracked black pepper, then the palate adds some crisp acids to pull everything together. It's a wine with bold fruit, low tannins and food-friendly acids, probably best consumed young.",Frediani Field Blend,87,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,Fortitude
70100,US,"This is really a lovely Paso-style Bordeaux blend. With Cab Franc, Malbec and Merlot, it offers delicious cherry, cassis, raspberry, cocoa, vanilla and smoked oak flavors, and while it's soft in acids, the firm tannins provide good structure and grip.

70103,France,"With a beautiful polished brass color, this is another typically intense offering from Marc Kreydenweiss.

The slightly roasty finish complements the structure.",Le Château Kastelberg Grand Cru,87,69.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Marc Kreydenweiss
70104,US,"A very nice, well-behaved Pinot. It's a villages-style wine, from a good vintage and a good winery. Dry and luscious, it has ripe, oak-infused cherry, blackberry and milk chocolate flavors, offset by adequate acidity. Drink now.",,87,29.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Stephen Ross
70105,Spain,"Plenty of dusty, spicy aromas run the nose, almost to the exclusion of ripe fruit. But once it opens the wine displays savory flavors as well as some pure dark berry. On the finish, it's a touch lean and crisp, but overall this is a balanced Rioja reserva with spunk.",Reserva,87,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Montecillo
70106,Spain,"A little leafy, a little spicy and a little bit of a throwback to the days when Rioja wasn't taken so seriously.

Somewhat acidic and sheer, so better with food; drink now.",Crianza,87,14.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Marqués de la Concordia
70107,Spain,"A juicy, prickly wine with pungent red-fruit aromas backed by tangy cherry, raspberry and currant flavors.

70110,US,"This is a tough wine to evaluate now because it's not showing well. It's very dry and tannic. There's a fruity, blackberry and cherry core, with a coffee and dill herbaceousness and plenty of oak. It's soft, but should develop well, and could eventually surprise.

70115,Italy,"Blueberry, forest berry and a delicate floral touch round off richly toasted notes that glide smoothly over a harmonious whole.

70116,Argentina,"Among the new crop of Patagonian Malbecs, this wine shows a sly style.

70118,US,"This Pinot is so ripe and full-bodied that it's almost Rhône-like. The black cherry pie and cola flavors veer into milk chocolate.

70122,US,"Although the label boasts that the wine received 30 months in American oak, it does not clobber you with wood; rather, it wraps its tight, muscular fruit in soft tannins and tangy acids.

70151,Chile,"Right off the bat this fails to impress. The nose has a chemical-like burn and weird, unfamiliar aromas. All this portends an industrial-tasting wine with odd infiltrations of butter and green vegetables. Barely acceptable.",,80,10.0,Central Valley,,,Carmenère,Corinto
70152,US,"Overripe and pruny-raisiny, like a cheap Port but without any sweetness, just acids and raw tannins.",Nate's Vineyard,80,24.0,California,Redwood Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Zinfandel,Claudia Springs
70153,US,"Too oaky, with dominating caramel and smoke flavors, and also very sharp. There's a citrusy bite of acidity that detracts. Finally, the wine ends on an overripe, Porty note.",Windacre,80,35.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Merriam
70154,US,"Hot and sweet, with burnt cherry pie filling flavors.",Lot 12,80,10.0,California,California,California Other,Zinfandel,Grayson
70155,US,"Don't expect dryness here. The wine is distinctly sugary-sweet and that's despite a ridiculously high alcohol level of 16.5%. But people who like sweet red wines, and there are lots of them, will slurp it up.",Fox Creek Vineyard Old Vine,80,32.0,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Villa Toscano
70156,Australia,"Starts off with mulberry, cola, vanilla and clove, and persists that way across the creamy-textured palate. A textbook Aussie blend, marrying immediate approachability with 5–8 years of ageability. Another fine effort from former Penfolds winemaker John Duval.",Plexus,91,40.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,G-S-M,John Duval Wines
70157,Uruguay,"While this ranks as one of the best Uruguayan reds we've come across, it's not a slam dunk. First off, there's the price; $60 is a lot to spend for any wine, let alone one from the frontier. But getting past that there's pretty fruit, purity, texture and balance to this prestige-aimed effort. And it finishes with alluring tobacco and earth notes. The blend is Cab Franc with Merlot, Tannat and Cab Sauvignon.",El Preciado Premier Gran Reserva,89,60.0,San Jose,,,Red Blend,Castillo Viejo
70158,Uruguay,"Weighty and rich, but the melon core to this Uruguayan Viognier is solid. The palate pumps round apple with walnut shadings, and the finish goes to melon, papaya and banana. It's already aging and won't last for long; get it while it's still good.",Don Pascual Reserve,86,15.0,Juanico,,,Viognier,Establecimiento Juanico
70159,Uruguay,"Earth, saddle leather and roasted berry aromas lead the meaty nose to a round, mildly tanninc palate that's holding full plum and berry flavors. For Uruguay, this is a nice wine that hits on the proper cylindars. But in the long run the oak is a bit weighty and the balance seems tenuous. Good by local standards.",Adagio Espressivo,86,30.0,Canelones,,,Red Blend,Toscanini
70160,Uruguay,"Among the Uruguayan wines we've tried more than once, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Tannat and Merlot has integrity. It's light and herbal on the nose, with red fruit and spearmint aromas leading to a palate of cherry and red raspberry. Feelwise, it's tight and tough, but with food it will show fairly well.",Rio Colorado,86,35.0,El Colorado,,,Red Blend,DeLucca
70161,Uruguay,"Maybe this wine weighs in a bit stewy and heavy, but along the way it has some virtues, namely an attractive rum-raisin quality to the bouquet and intense black-fruit flavors. It's a chunky wine that stumbles along the palate, but you have to admire it's richness and stuffing. The blend is Tannat, Cabernet and Merlot.",TCM,85,19.0,Canelones,,,Red Blend,Toscanini
70162,Uruguay,"This blend of several grapes led by Tannat is a touch gritty and stewed. Yes, it has its qualities such as jammy berry and a nice, fleshy feel. But it's wayward and jumpy, and overall balance is elusive. Very expenisve for what you get.",Preludio Barrel Select Lote Number 60,84,50.0,Juanico,,,Red Blend,Establecimiento Juanico
70163,Uruguay,"Buttercup and other flowery aromas give it a good start. The palate is fairly plump and creamy, with apricot, melon and nutty flavors. Toward the finish it tilts a little toward banana. Not typical Viognier, but this is Uruguay.",Posada Del Virrey Reserve,84,13.0,Colonia,,,Viognier,Dante Irurtia
70164,Uruguay,"Deep and baked on the nose, with soft, fleshy blackberry and plum flavors. On the palate the wine's tannins are tame and the fruit seems exceedingly rich.  So drink now to get its last gasp of gusto; soon it will probably turn heavier that it is now.",Catamayor Reserve of the Family,84,17.0,San Jose,,,Tannat,Castillo Viejo
70165,Uruguay,"Orange and apricot aromas are backed by big, baked flavors of lemon and melon. Starts faster than it finishes; sluggish and heavy on the finish.",S Torrens Oak Reserve,82,40.0,Colonia,,,Chardonnay,Los Cerros de San Juan
70166,Uruguay,"Very expensive for a novelty, and without coming down too hard on it, it's fat and raisiny with a heavy ripeness that is tough to swallow. Ripasso by nature is a rich, sweet, sticky style of wine but this rendition lacks edge and focus.",Angel's Cuvée Ripasso de Tannat,81,59.0,Atlantida,,,Tannat,Viñedo de los Vientos
70167,France,"A big, rich wine, showing its gorgeous fruit easily. But with a core of dryness, the ripest apricots touched by caramel, it should age well over many years. There is intense power here, still hidden by the youth of the wine, but with final concentration.",,98,200.0,Bordeaux,Barsac,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Climens
70168,France,"Powered by dry botrytis, this is a wine with immense potential. It has weight, complexity and richness, all under the cloak of botrytis. To leaven the power, there is acidity, but this is certainly for aging.",,97,90.0,Bordeaux,Sauternes,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Suduiraut
70169,Spain,"Beautifully composed, with power and just as much precision and pizzazz. The nose offers lightly baked berry fruit notes, leather and spice, while the palate is loaded with tobacco, exotic spices and the finest natural berry flavors Spain has to offer. Smooth, elegant, finessed and potent, with integrated tannins and bold acidity that will keep it going for at least a decade. Drink from 2012 through 2018.",Malleolus de Valderramiro,97,180.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
70170,US,"Wild Horse captures the essence of Central Coast Pinot. The wine isn't especially complex or ageable, but defines the fruit and acid balance of the region. Cherries, black raspberries, root beer and spiced rum punch are the flavors, and the wine is silky and dry.",,87,25.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Wild Horse
70171,France,"Inherent wet stone and lively citrus entice you with the promise of refreshment. The palate delivers as well with bright green apple and lemon rind. Plump and medium weight in the mouth, it finishes as clean and minerally as anticipated. Imported by Paramount Brands.",,87,12.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,W. Gisselbrecht
70172,Australia,"Surprisingly complete and harmonious for a Riesling in this price range, Wagtail's 2006 boasts opening scents of honey, ripe apples, citrus and crushed stone. Peach and citrus flavors dominate the palate, ending dry and stony. Drink now.",,87,10.0,South Australia,Adelaide Hills,,Riesling,Wagtail
70173,Spain,"Tilts a bit toward the ripe side, with sweet, mature aromas of blueberry, raisin and vanilla. It's fleshy and soft in terms of feel, with earthy, warm flavors of fig, berry and molasses. Drink now for its traditional integrity and tobacco-like qualities; it's not improving.",Coto De Imaz Reserva,87,23.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,El Coto
70174,US,"This is soft, dry and a little heavy. They must have kept yields really low, because the cherry and raspberry fruit is really concentrated and liqueur-like. Plenty of toasty new oak adds to the impression of opulence.",,87,55.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Pinot Noir,El Molino
70175,New Zealand,"Lean and crisp, yet still holding on to a hint of residual sugar, this zesty Riesling boasts aromas and flavors of green apple, lime and honey, then turns chalky and tart on the finish.",John Forrest Collection,87,40.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Forrest Estate
70176,Italy,"There's a lot going on in the glass thanks to penetrating aromas of red fruit, smoky toast and white chocolate. Although the nose in intense, it's a bit awkward with a few thorny spots along the way. But the wine does boast a beautiful ruby color and a silky, caressing mouthfeel.",Mazzon,87,48.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Pinot Nero,Gottardi
70177,Chile,"Ripe and pure with blackberry and olive aromas, and the flavors of black fruits mixed with some meatiness and cola are true and tasty. The feel is a touch racy and acidic, but that's working to keep this balanced.",Reserva Estate Vineyard,87,12.0,Curicó Valley,,,Carmenère,Gracia de Chile
70178,US,"With two-thirds Cabernet and a third Merlot, this is classic Paso Bordeaux, a ripe, fruity wine that's soft in acids and tannins. But it's fully dry, which lets you appreciate the blackberry, cherry and new oak flavors.",Meritage,87,25.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Hasley
70179,Chile,"A light coating of toasty, buttery oak creates just the right woodiness, while   the pear, honey and quince flavors are entirely inviting and pleasant. There's even some warm nuttiness on the delicate finish. A go-for-it Chard at   this price.",,87,7.0,Central Valley,,,Chardonnay,Chilcas
70180,Portugal,"A firm, dry lean wine, with some tough tannins, but also with great red fruits and good freshness. This young Dão, with its blend of Tinta Roriz, Jaen and Touriga Nacional, is likely to develop, with its tannins and acidity softening. At the moment, freshness is the key.",Aliança Reserva,87,8.0,Dão,,,Portuguese Red,Caves Aliança
70181,US,"Hits the palate with acidity so high, it's almost searing. Not unpleasant, but certainly calls for the softening effects of food. Pleasant flavors, too, of ripe passionfruit, zesty pineapple, crisp green apple and honeysuckle, and a finish of real complexity.",,87,20.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Desperate White
70182,Spain,"A little tight and reticent, but airing reveals aromas of raisin, marzipan and earth. The palate is measurably peppier, with lean but healthy red-fruit flavors stepping up and demanding to be noticed. As for feel, expect grabby tannins and shortness. Probably at its best now but will hold steady for at least five more years.",Conde de Valdemar Gran Reserva,87,25.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Valdemar
70183,US,"Tastes like cherry-pie filling that got a little caramelized in the oven, giving it a Rhône-type note. Maybe charred oak contributes to the smoky heaviness. Either way, it's a distraction from the delicate, sensual silkiness we all want from Pinot Noir.",Pratt Vineyard,87,56.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
70184,France,"From vineyards to the west of Sancerre in the Loire, Sancerrois Alexandre Mellot has produced a classically fresh, simple, very drinkable wine, showing great awareness of the apple and green pear character of Sauvignon Blanc. Drink this year.",Sincérité,87,10.0,Loire Valley,Vin de Pays du Jardin de la France,,Sauvignon Blanc,Joseph Mellot
70185,US,"This is certainly a big, bold Pet wine, the kind lovers of the variety treasure. Dry and tannic, it's explosive in extremely ripe cherry and black raspberry jam flavors, with all kinds of mushroomy, leathery, chocolaty, spicy complexities. As big as the tannins are, they're of the modern, melted kind, making the wine instantly drinkable.",,87,28.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Petite Sirah,Judd's Hill

70187,New Zealand,"A plump, off-dry Riesling, this wine kicks off with scents of passion fruit as well as hints of honey and grapefruit. Honeyed citrus and green apple flavors take over on the palate, finishing long and clean.",New Zealand Falcon,87,16.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Lake Chalice
70188,France,"A classic Sancerre, with great mineral character. The structure is all there, the green and white fruits are dominant. There is just a hint of lees and yeast on this young wine.",Domaine André Raffaitin,87,,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Jacques Raffaitin
70189,Australia,"An off-dry style, marked by residual sugar, which gives it a sweetly fruity profile. Obvious honey and peach notes verge on simple, but don't lack elegance. Drink now.",Artisan Wines Classic,87,10.0,Victoria,Victoria,,Riesling,Marquee
70190,France,"With its heavy bottle and designer label and name, this must qualify as the most expensive looking vin de pays from the Loire. Somehow the wine, while a pleasant, ripe Sauvignon, doesn't live up to the package. But the price is fine, so enjoy a lively, lightly toasty but still fresh green-fruited wine.",Attitude,87,14.0,Loire Valley,Vin de Pays du Jardin de la France,,Sauvignon Blanc,Pascal Jolivet
70191,US,"Good, rich Syrah, dry and tannic, although the tannins are finely ground and easily negotiable now.

Drink now.",,87,22.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Zaca Mesa
70192,Italy,"Generous and fragrant aromas of sweet fruit, peach, melon and a dusty mineral note are derived from the Cortaccia and Magrè chalk gravel vineyards in Alto Adige. Lean and crisp in the mouth, this is one of those drink-anytime wines that pairs with a long list of foods.",,87,14.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Pinot Bianco,Tiefenbrunner
70193,New Zealand,"This Sauvignon from a Maori-owned venture is a bit extreme in style, but well-made. It leans toward the vegetal side of Sauv Blanc, hinting at string beans and green tomatoes, then closes with a powerful blast of white-grapefruity tartness. Drink now.",,87,16.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Tohu
70194,Chile,"Given that this wine comes from the Cachapoal Valley, which is warm and normally puts out red wines, this is quite a success. The bouquet is vanilla-tinged and full of apple and nut oil, while the palate blends fresh pear and buttered toast flavors. It's smooth but still fairly fresh, with a richer, somewhat oily mouthfeel that is likely the result of its hotter terroir.",La Capitana Barrel Reserve,87,15.0,Cachapoal Valley,,,Chardonnay,Viña La Rosa
70195,US,"Gets the Port job done with sweet flavors of caramel, blackberry jam, tangerine zest, chocolate, sweetened coffee and licorice flavors, while acidity gives a much-needed crunch.

70197,US,"Delicate floral aromas and a combination of ripe pineapple and melon flavors are just part of the package with this exemplary wine from Anthony Road, which has a talent for making approachable Rieslings.

70199,France,"Starts off a bit stinky and reductive on the nose, but in the mouth it's fresh and fruity.

70201,Italy,"Menthol, toast and modest berry offset a stern and firmly tannic wine that needs more time in the cellar.

70202,Italy,"Burnt coffee, black tar, cherry cola, almond paste, stewed strawberries and a note of rubber create a dramatic, slightly over-the-top Brunello. There's a viscous fullness to the mouth that makes a good match for the wine's fruity, clean finish. Imported by Tosco Wines.",,89,,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Verbena
70203,US,"Good effort in the dark, syrupy vein of Washington Syrah. The scents are ripe and somewhat raisiny, almost Port-like, but the oak has been reined in and the wine reflects the character of the vintage, which was quite warm. The flavors are dense with mincemeat pie, rum raisin, prune, soy and chocolate, a veritable baker's box of spices. Notes of cherry tobacco lead into dry, herbal tannins; hot and assertive, yet packed with flavor.",,89,28.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Syrah,Woodinville Wine Cellars

70205,US,"Concentrated and supple, this meaty and tannic blend of 56% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and a smattering of Cab Franc and Syrah comes from estate vineyards on Red Mountain.

70207,Australia,"Rosemount's most famous Chard is a success again, with ample nut, vanilla bean, hickory, grilled meat and stone fruit flavors, coming to a lemony point on the finish.

Imported by Foster's Wine Estates Americas.",Roxburgh,89,25.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,Chardonnay,Rosemount
70208,Spain,"Spicy and exotic, with tight fruit and plenty of tannin in the mouth. There's a lot of juicy blackberry flavors along with full-force acids and verve.

Imported by Bon Vivant Imports.",Crianza,89,27.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Rejadorada

70210,US,"More Yakima than Walla Walla, this tight, stylish Cab shows plenty of leaf and herb, but nothing stemmy or bitter.

Offers a medium to full build with persistent length and a firm, spicy finish. Imported by Tricana Imports.",,89,,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Fattoi
70214,Argentina,"Impressive and saturated, with ripe aromas. The mouth is focused and, generally speaking, quite rewarding. The blackberry and dark plum flavors are big and aggressive. If there's any one place the wine doesn't wow, it's on the finish, which is short and a bit sharp-edged. Needs food.

Imported by Vinifera Imports.",,89,66.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Tenuta Friggiali
70218,Australia,"Aromas are of violets and wheat bread, both of which unfold on the palate, too. Mocha, black cherry and plum flavors carry through to the smooth, meaty finish.

70221,Spain,"Quite ripe, with a touch of stewiness that settles with time and morphs into a pool of ripe cherries, berries and raisins.

Imported by Five Star Imports.",Coranya,89,45.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Sangenís I Vaqué
70222,Spain,"Lots of bacon, leather and earth coat the nose of this vanguard-style Rioja, but unlike the spectacular 2001, the '02 is not nearly as deep and ethereal. Blame the cool, wet vintage and take solace in the fact that it's still a rich, almost syrupy red with integrated tannins and lushness. What's missing is the wine's patented layering and complexity. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/Fine Estates from Spain.",,89,49.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,San Vicente

70224,US,"A blend of Cabernet and 16% Syrah. It's quite dense and black in the style of the winery, and powerfully scented with black cherry, loganberry and cedar.

70226,Israel,"Pricey, but one of the better efforts to come out of Israel, successfully marrying plum fruit with vanilla and toasted coconut and some fine pipe tobacco notes.

70228,Italy,"This is a wine you'll love or you won't. Our panelists came up with a long list of descriptors for the nose: strawberry, rhubarb, pastry crust, smoked bacon fat, resin, rubber and tar.

70230,US,"A splendid, near-perfect Pinot, although it's very young and will benefit from time in the bottle. Few Pinots offer richer, more massive flavors. Just explodes on the palate with raspberries, cherries, persimmons, Dr. Pepper cola, mocha and cinnamon spices, yet the tannin-acid structure keeps it all balanced.

70231,US,"From the wildest, most remote and exotic stretch of the Sonoma Coast: you can taste the salt of the sea in this wine, as you can in a Manzanilla Sherry. It gives a tang to the lemondrop, pear and honeysuckle flavors, with their lick of cold granite. So pure and vibrant, so savory, so compelling. Grows more fascinating with every minute in the glass.",Estate,97,42.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Failla
70232,US,"Filled with black and red berries and stone fruits that have a smoky, grilled edge, this dramatic Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend hails from several great vineyards, mainly Stagecoach, which is up on Atlas Peak.

A compelling, complex and nuanced wine of great elegance and allure.",Stature,96,120.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Kendall-Jackson

70234,US,"Superb, opulent, just wonderful. Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Fantastically ripe and rich in black cherries, currants, sandalwood and spices, with a grounding streak of herbs. Beyond the flavors is the near-perfect structure, marked by smooth, complex tannins.

70235,Spain,"Talk about magnetic aromas of bacon, tobacco and bold black fruit, and then comes an oak-rich palate full of coconut, butter, chocolate and exotic berry flavor. Chocolate truffle and pastry work the finish, and overall this is a mile-deep beauty to drink from 2011 through 2017.",Malleolus de Sanchomartin,96,204.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto del Pais,Emilio Moro
70236,US,"This one-of-a-kind offering from Chehalem celebrates what they are calling a “great” vintage. The wine is dark, supple and immensely rich and dense, yet retains a lightness that captures the elegance of the Pinot Noir grape while propelling it to rarified heights. The mix of red and purple fruits, herb, spice and earth all come together in a smooth and seductive wine that drinks like a dream.",Statement,95,99.0,Oregon,Ribbon Ridge,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Chehalem
70237,US,"A very fine Cab from the estate, which is in the north-central part of the Rutherford appellation. Judging from the tannins, it's too youthful to drink now, with a tight, astringent mouthfeel and fleshy, unintegrated oak. But the flavors are extraordinary. They flood the mouth with the essence of Cabernet, with ripe blackberries, black currants, raspberries and mocha, and the spicy finish lasts for a full minute. Give it until 2013, and it should provide great drinking through 2019, at least.",Red Wine,95,140.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Quintessa
70238,US,"Drier and earthier than many Napa Cabs these days, this wine has subtle sage and sweet licorice that grounds its fruitier flavors of blackberries, cherries and raspberries. Very beautiful are the tannins, which are rich and pure, suggesting perfect ripeness. The small Bosché bottling has been a premier one for the winery for many years, and this '05 is one of the best in memory. Should age effortlessly for at least a dozen years.",Bosché,95,70.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Freemark Abbey
70239,US,"What a wonderful wine. So pure, so fine and so Bordeaux-esque, like a fine young Margaux that needs time. Made from 100% Cabernet grapes, it shows classic blackberry and black currant flavors, beautifully oaked, with smooth, polished tannins and a fleshy mouthfeel. A feminine wine, it has great charm now, and should develop in the bottle for many years.",Rennie Reserve,95,100.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Flora Springs
70240,US,"A terrific Pinot Noir that's so delicious, you can't stop drinking it, and also shows a wonderful, classic coastal complexity. With tangy acidity and ultrarefined tannins, it gives the essence of wild raspberries and cherries. There's a feral quality to the fruit; you can detect notes of mountain eucalyptus, fennel and lavender. Oak adds the perfect touch of smoke. Just lovely, now and through 2014.",Pearlessence,95,40.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
70241,US,"An amazingly rich, complex and ageworthy wine. Made from 100% Cabernet grapes, it shows firm, plush flavors of blackberries and black currants, with a sour cherry candy tartness that's clean and piquant in the mouth. But the wine is also very tannic, giving a dry astringency through the finish. Should reward time in the cellar. Best 2012–2018.",Hillside Reserve,95,100.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Flora Springs
70242,US,"Piña has a spectacular record with this wine, and indeed with all their Cabs from Howell Mountain. The '07 is notable for its superb structure. It has pristine tannins and a good, dry mouthfeel, with very rich flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate and cedar that are grounded with notes of anise and sweet herbs. Very fine and dramatic, this 100% Cab should develop for at least the next eight years.",Buckeye Vineyard,95,85.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Piña
70243,France,"A beautifully ripe wine, layered with the richest fruit, the acidity offering a bright moment within the richness. Botrytis is there, like a hard core for the pillow of ripe apricots, lychees, spice and fine freshness.",,95,,Bordeaux,Sauternes,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Clos Haut-Peyraguey
70244,US,"A tremendous wine that easily merits being Barnett's most expensive release. Shows the ripe blackberry and black currant flavors and new oak that are so easily achieved, with yet near perfect tannins and a dryness unusual in a Cabernet this fruity. The combination of opposites makes this mountain wine noteworthy, as well as ageable. Now–2017.",Rattlesnake Hill Estate Bottled,95,125.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Barnett
70245,US,"All Maresh vineyard grapes are behind this gorgeous and feminine Pinot, with soft and evocative scents of truffle, chocolate and raspberry. Brilliant winemaking that takes all the elements of great Oregon fruit and puts them into unique focus, with winemaker Kelley Fox's trademark blend of biodynamic earthy/fungal flavors, elegant berry/cherry fruit, and just a touch of milk chocolate. The alcohol just reaches 13%.",Audrey,95,65.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Scott Paul
70246,US,"This is a very high-class Cabernet. You can tell from the sumptuous tannins and the overall balance and elegance. It's soft and gentle enough to drink now, with voluptuous waves of blackberries, black currants, anise, chocolate and cedar, yet shows a density that suggests midterm ageability through 2015 or so.",H.B. Vineyard,95,225.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Peju
70247,US,"The vineyard is in Oakville, and the wine, which is 100% Cabernet, shows classically firm tannins and Oakville's signature blackberries and black currants. Oak adds fleshy, smoky notes that are perfectly in keeping with the fruit. Very dry, this is a wine you want to cellar. Best after 2012, and will develop in a good cellar for many years afterward.",Holy Smoke Vineyard,94,85.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Flora Springs

70249,US,"Oregon has always made great Rieslings, yet few of the state's winemakers have ever made it a priority. Trisaetum's James Frey is out to change that, and is off to a great start. This 2008, like its predecessor, captures the complexity, grace and compelling charm of the grape. Dense and still light, it brings honey, tea, lemon, nectarine, jasmine, lime, caramel and sweet nut flavors together, a riotous jumble that is beyond delicious. But wait; it will improve with cellaring.",,94,24.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Riesling,Trisaetum
70250,US,"This Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend is very fine, and shows the classic structure of Rutherford. The tannins are rich and dusty, and there's a sour candy taste to the red and black cherries, enriched with smoky oak. With a long, richly spicy finish, it should easily negotiate the next 6–8 years in the cellar.",Estate Bottled Rutherford Red,94,80.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,William Harrison
70251,France,"Packed with botrytis, this is a wine whose sweetness is suppressed by richness.

This is a wine whose journey is just beginning.",,94,,Bordeaux,Sauternes,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Lafaurie-Peyraguey
70252,US,"Coniglio specializes in appellation-specific bottlings from Napa Valley. With this Cab, they have captured the essence of Diamond Mountain. It's a sturdy, tannic, ageworthy wine, with the density of flavors and complex structure that low-yielding mountain grapes give. Rich and appealing, it should develop over the next decade.",,94,60.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Coniglio
70253,US,"Dense and intricately constructed, this Pinot Noir always is a big, rich fruity wine. The 2007 is perhaps emblematic of the vineyard, showing massive flavors of cherries, blueberries and wilder, foxier berries that have an exotic note. The tannins are thick, and the wine is entirely dry. Very fine, a chef's dream to pair with perfectly matched food. Fine now, with a few hours of decanting, and should develop through 2013, at least.",Klopp Ranch,94,57.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
70254,US,"This has a surprising amount of vanilla cream in the flavors, plus soft, seductive raspberry fruit. The fruit comes from the oldest part of the Maresh vineyard—38-year-old self-rooted vines. The wine is a pale rose, yet substantial in the style of a classic Pinot from Eyrie. After some hours breathing it opens up with elegant, seductive aromas and some caramel streaks, delicate and perfectly proportioned.",Maresh Vineyard,94,50.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Kelley Fox
70255,Spain,"Make room in the cellar for this heavyweight! Talk about a monster wine; but there's also finesse, character and style to it. Alabaster is the top wine from the Eguren family's new Toro winery, and it's big, tannic and loaded with spice, molasses and syrupy black fruit flavors. Rich, long and fierce on the finish, with tannins and heat to resolve. Best from 2012 through 2020.",Alabaster,94,250.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
70256,US,"A very good wine, rich and softly drinkable now, with voluptuous tannins. It's extraordinarily ripe in blackberries, black cherries, anise, chocolate, spices and cedar. Doesn't seem all that much better than the winery's regular '06 Cab, at less than half the price, but it's quite opulent and will develop for a decade.",Estate Bottled Reserve,94,105.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Peju
70257,US,"This is a restaurant wine. It's really fancy, really good and really food-friendly. Although it's rich in fruit and oak, it possesses an underlying tension, with acidity and tannins all vying for center stage. You're always looking for the center of gravity.

70258,US,"Pristine is the word that comes to mind. Also pure, transparent, lucid. It's bone dry and crisp and elusively complex in citrus, pear, mineral and floral aromas and flavors, subtlely enhanced with oak. Only 45 cases were produced, but it's worth the search.",Alban Vineyard,94,39.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Viognier,Failla
70259,US,"The top wine from Ken Wright in 2008, this beautifully elegant wine clocks in at just 13.3% alcohol, yet delivers a mouthful of delicious flavors.

70261,US,"I liked Cobblestone's regular Cab; at nearly half the price, it's better. Like that one, this is very ripe and rich in jammy blackberry, cassis, cherry and milk chocolate flavors, but seems oakier and riper, which intensifies the sweet flavors almost beyond table wine levels.",Reserve,87,69.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cobblestone

70263,South Africa,"Jacobsdal has been making wine for nearly four decades and with this Pinotage, the producer's years of experience show. The aromas are typical of South African Pinotage: smoke, banana, red berry and plum. Flavors of raspberry and cherry are framed by structured but subtle tannins.

Broad and full, the finish is appropriately dusty and short.",,87,24.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Joseph Cattin

70276,Chile,"A full nose of charred oak and smoky black cherry is phase one.

70277,France,"A wine you could sit and smell for a long time, with classic Côte-Rôtie aromas of smoke, pepper and herb twined around a core of raspberry fruit.

70278,Italy,"This wine hits all the right buttons: Its pricing is unbeatable, the packaging is fun with a Paola de Manincor painting on the label and its overall quality is very good. Delicious honey, acacia, polished stone, pink grapefruit and peach are obvious components of an opulent aromatic ensemble. It is lean and racy in the mouth with prominent crispness and good length. Pair it with Indian dishes.",Dipinti,87,11.0,Northeastern Italy,Trentino,,Riesling,La Vis
70279,Spain,"A good effort in a tough year, and frankly we're happy that Muga decided to make a reserva in 2002. The wine shows lean aromas of dried red fruit, tomato leaf and dill. In fact, dill is a recurring theme from front to back. And along the way there's acids, red cherries, plums and currants. Good but leaner than a normal Muga effort.",Reserve,87,23.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Muga
70280,Spain,"Early aromas of leather, rubber and char sort of shadow the fruit component. But in the mouth there's ample blackberry, cherry and pepper, all of which bring the wine into form.

70283,France,"A luxury bottling from the local co-op, this is a blend of wines from mainly Le Méal and L'Hermite.

70306,Spain,"Mature but not even close to expiring, with cola, root beer, tree bark and leather on the bouquet. Fairly acidic, which is why it has so much verve at 10+ years.

Slightly heavy but that's the style; like its sister manzanilla, this wine is very consistent year to year.",La Ina Fino,88,14.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,Domecq
70314,Spain,"Quite international in style, a direct reflection of the Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah components that comprise the wine. That said, this is probably the best wine Martinez Bujanda has made at its La Mancha winery; it's plump and ripe, with nice cherry and plum flavors. It's medium in weight and length, and juicy. Likable as can be. Imported by CIV/USA.",Reserva,88,15.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,Red Blend,Finca Antigua
70315,Australia,"Feminine on the nose, but a little broad on the palate. Pear and talc notes start things off, with heaps of stone fruit, white pepper and citrus flavors. A very good wine, but doesn't quite have the kick of acidity that it has had in recent vintages. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.",Thorn,88,19.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,,Riesling,Grant Burge
70316,US,"This is a bit bigger than the “regular” 2003 Two Vineyards red wine, but doesn't have the same level of complexity and finesse. Ripe, tannic, hearty and a bit chalky, this 95% Cab Sauvignon gets the “reserve” tag due to its size rather than its subtlety.",Two Vineyards Reserve,88,52.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hedges
70317,Australia,"This Sangiovese (60%)-Shiraz (40%) blend has dried-spice aromas and plum flavors. There's a vanilla-mocha accent, as well as an interesting almost orange/citrus one. Tannins will easily cut through an extra-cheese pizza. Imported by Robert Whale Selections Inc.",Contour 4 Sangiovese-Shiraz,88,16.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Red Blend,Coriole
70318,US,"Definitely the winery's shining star; this is a firm, succulent style of sauv blanc, lightly toasty, with good fruit flavors that seem to fall right on the cusp between citrus and stone fruits. Polished and flavorful.",,88,8.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Arbor Crest
70319,US,"Spiced up with tobacco, mint and a bit of pepper, this light, herbal Syrah shows that you don't need 15% alcohol levels of ripeness to make a flavorful, complex wine. The flavors are compact and layered, and they linger beautifully on the palate. This is a wine that should knit together very nicely over the next 6–8 years.",Spofford Station Vineyard,88,23.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Colvin Vineyards
70320,US,"This is Ferrari-Carano's most upscale wine, a blend comprised of all five of the famous Bordeaux varieties. It's as lush and intricate as almost anything out of Napa, with sumptuous blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors. The giveaway that it's Sonoma comes in the herbaceousness and slightly greener tannins. Now–2013.",Tresor,94,58.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ferrari-Carano
70321,US,"The tannins are strong in this 100% Cab, giving it a tough astringency, but there's no denying the wealth of blackberries, black currants, violets and cedar that flood the mouth and last through a long, spicy finish. The vineyard is in the cooler southern part of the valley, on the east side of Oak Knoll. Give this wine time. 2012–2018.",Out of Sight Vineyard,94,85.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Flora Springs
70322,US,"A brilliant dessert wine. It costs a lot of money to pick a wine like this, which is carefully selected on an almost cluster-by-cluster basis, but the results speak for themselves. Very sweet and pure, with honey, apricot jam, pineapple crème brûlée and vanilla custard flavors. Utterly delicious.",Gold Select Late Harvest Blanc,94,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,Martin Estate
70323,France,"A beautifully ripe wine, layering all the dense botrytis of the vintage with freshest acidity. It has weight, the texture of grainy honey, ripe yellow fruits, mango and orange zest. Impressive and certainly for aging.",,94,110.0,Bordeaux,Sauternes,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Sigalas Rabaud
70324,US,"Despite a burst of tannins and acidity that make this wine somewhat aggressive, it's absolutely delicious, and should reward 3–5 years in the cellar. The flavors are massive, suggesting rich black cherry pie filling, cola and cedar, with a tantalizing edge of chocolate and roasted almonds. It's quite a good wine. Decant if you drink now.",West Slope Estate Grown,93,70.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Donum
70325,US,"This is one of the most tannic Cabs Far Niente has produced in quite a while. It's really not drinkable now, despite very complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, licorice, tobacco and plums, along with plenty of smoky new oak. Made with a few drops of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, which add perfume and flowers, it's a wine that won't come into its own for quite a while. Hold until 2013, at least, and it should provide interesting drinking for years after, in a proper cellar.",Estate Bottled,93,115.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Far Niente
70326,Spain,"A touch doughy on the nose, with prune and blackberry aromas that are neither pushy nor aggressive. The palate is ripe, rich and just forward enough, with blackberry, wild berry, coffee and fudge flavors. Settles nicely on the finish, and overall this wine shows almost all of what's good about modern Ribera del Duero wines. 250 cases made; drink now through 2015.",Tinto Figuero Noble,93,131.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,García Figuero
70327,US,"Quite a fine wine, although like Flora Springs' other '07 Cabs, it needs time in the cellar to come around. Grown in the Pope Valley section of eastern Napa, it shows ripe, flashy flavors of blackberries, cherries and chocolate, but those tannins are tough and hard. You can decant it now, but better to hold until 2011 or so.",Wild Boar Vineyard,93,85.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Flora Springs
70328,US,"Disconnected in its youth, with separate oak and fruit elements that need time to find each other and marry. The oak shows up as caramel and butterscotch, while the fruit stands aloof, in blackberry and black currant superiority. Seems to have the inherent balance for aging. Try after 2013.",Cyrus Ryan Vineyard,93,95.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Barnett
70329,US,"Done in a spätlese style, this off-dry wine is elegance personified. Complex flavors weave through the palate—sweet hay, honey, citrus and stone fruits, breakfast tea, chamomile, jasmine. It just keeps on going, while retaining a lightness and transparency that rivets your attention.",,93,24.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Riesling,Trisaetum
70330,France,"The aromas are intensely sweet, full of orange marmalade and honey. The palate goes more for spice, with oranges and brown sugar allied to fresh fruits, apricots and lychees. The final flavors are delicious and enticing.",,93,,Bordeaux,Barsac,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Coutet
70331,US,"This has pure fruit – strawberry especially – creating an elegant, light, delicate, complex, though still quite young wine. Some caraway seed flavors come into play, and bolder black cherry fruit.",Maresh Vineyard,93,50.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Kelley Fox
70332,US,"From the steep Sonoma slopes of Mount St. Helena comes this tannic, concentrated young 100% Cabernet. Dramatic in structure and flavor, with massively packed blackberries, dark chocolate and pain grillé. The wine was aged in 49% new oak, which adds smoky, spice overtones. Drink now and through 2013.",Jackson Hills,93,40.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kendall-Jackson
70333,US,"This is a Zin for the cellar. It's fine now in rich fruit, but fairly tannic, and there's some tension of parts that 3–4 years should resolve. Shows very pure, focused black currant and cedar flavors, liberally dusted with peppery spices. The challenge with these big Zins is balance, which Sanctuary's '06 achieves.",Mariah Vineyard,93,25.0,California,Mendocino Ridge,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Zinfandel,Sanctuary
70334,US,"An extraordinarily rich, tannic and dry wine, which despite its big structure is relieved by potent flavors of cherries, blackberries, plums and cedar, with savory touches of anise, sage and black pepper. It's a complex, well-crafted wine that should develop in the bottle at least through 2014.",Three Palms Vineyard,93,85.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Duckhorn
70335,US,"Here's a big, thick, ripe Pinot Noir. It's not clearly a whole lot better than Morgan's regular Double L Pinot, which costs far less. But it is more powerful in the intensity of blackberries and cherries, as well as oak. If power in California Pinot Noir is your thing, go for it. Should age well for up to eight years.",Hat Trick Double L Vineyard,93,85.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Morgan
70336,US,"Very fine and high-toned, a Cabernet that shows real class and pedigree. Entirely drinkable now for its soft, lush tannins and elaborately detailed blackberry, black cherry, anise, carob and cedar flavors that last long through a spicy finish. Should age well through 2015.",Reserve,93,56.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Summers
70337,New Zealand,"Simply put, this is one of New Zealand's flagship reds, and it is a shame it is no longer being imported to the U.S. Lifted hints of dried flowers and herbs impart great complexity to the aromas, and the wine's cassis, cedar and chocolate flavors come across as intense without being overbearing. This is firmly structured, with plentiful but fine tannins. Drink 2015–2025.",Coleraine,93,,Hawke's Bay,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Te Mata
70338,US,"Easily the best Merlot in memory from Lake County, this one stands next to anything from Napa Valley, which is just over the hill from the vineyard. Shows a gorgeous tannin structure, with ripe, complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, red currants, mocha, green olives and cedar.",Tephra Ridge Vineyard,93,40.0,California,Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Merlot,Langtry
70339,US,"Tastes and feels like all the parts are very good. The tannins are polished, the fruit is ripe and complex, the oak is elaborate, and there's a nice bite of acidity in the background. The blackberry, black currant, carob and cedar flavors are enticing and dry. But this wine is too young. It has a youthful rudeness that demands 5–7 years in the cellar. The score reflects potential.",The Philanthropist Yountville Estate Vineyard,93,52.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Markham
70340,US,"Longplay's 2008 reserve is quite different from its non-¬reserve stablemate. The aromas include more earthy barnyard scents, the color has a hint of maturity, and no new oak was used. As a result, this wine could pass for one with a few more years under its belt; its flavors more suggestive of fruit pastry, figs and plums, leather and compost. Complex and detailed, it's a lovely effort.",Jory Bench Reserve Lia's Vineyard,93,30.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Longplay
70341,US,"Delicious and appealing, a palate-flattering wine that offers a gorgeous structure. Waves of black cherries, raspberries, cola, sweet rhubarb pie, persimmon and pomegranate flood the palate, and then a crisp gate of acidity slams down on the finish, although the spices get through and linger long. Best now for sheer exuberance.",Liberty Bridge Split Rock Vineyard,93,45.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Calicaro
70342,New Zealand,"In 2008, the Block 3 tannins are so silky and refined they give a soft, luscious character to the wine that's incredibly appealing. Spice, black cherry and cola notes finish long and complex. Drink now–2015.",Block 3,93,80.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Felton Road
70343,Spain,"Outstanding Sherry with complexity, richness and character. The nose has a salinic zest to it, making it no wallflower, and of course there's raisin and prune. The palate is formed, sculpted and balanced, with peanut M&M;'s candy, roasted fruit, chocolate ice cream and more. A beauty with power and poise.",Matusalem Oloroso Dulce Viejo,93,45.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,González Byass
70344,US,"Beautifully soft and limpid. So pretty and polished now, with ultrafine tannins framing ripe, dry flavors of black and red cherries, currants, chocolate, herbs and smoky sandalwood. Dramatic and opulent, this 100% Cab was aged in 40% new French oak.",Highlands Estates Raptor Peak,93,80.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kendall-Jackson
70345,US,"When Petite Sirah is at its best, and this one is, it offers incomparable structure and flavors. Nothing quite like it anywhere, with its inky dark color, big, thick tannins and ripe, exuberant flavors of berries, currants, mocha, leather, tobacco, cedar and peppery spices. What's especially nice about this bottling is the dryness and moderate alcohol. A superior wine that should age for the better part of a decade.",,93,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Petite Sirah,Summers
70346,US,"Four vineyards – Ribbon Ridge, Momtazi, Maresh and Shea – are included here. Soft and seductive, this wine caresses the palate with silky fruit. Aromatically it weaves together red fruits, truffles and clean, earthy scents. It reaches just over 13% alcohol; truly Burgundian yet with an Oregon flair to the fruit flavors. It puts the lie to any notion that this was a poor vintage. Challenging to be sure, but great wines were made in 2007, and this is one of them.",La Paulée,93,30.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Scott Paul
70347,Spain,"This is the tier-two wine from the Egurens' new Toro project, and it's stellar. Intense aromas of black fruit, char and mint start it out, and next up come cola, roasted black fruit, clove and cured-meat flavors. Oak is forward now, but it should settle in a year or so. A dynamite Toro to drink from 2011 through 2018.",Victorino,93,71.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
70348,US,"Dominique Lafon consults on these wines, sourced from a vineyard now almost 30 years old.  Evening Land is among the wineries who sense an opportunity to make refined, elegant wines from the terroir of this little-known region. Lovely aromas, complex scents and flavors, pine and herb, cranberry and raspberry, earth and seafoam—lots of nuances here.",Seven Springs Vineyard La Source,93,67.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Evening Land
70349,Spain,"A wonderfully balanced and giving wine with sweet raisin and prune aromas and an overall richness akin to crude oil. Flavors of baked black plum, brown sugar and molasses are both juicy and rich, and then toffee and mocha take over on the finish. Sweet and thick for sure, but with discernible fruit and vitality.",Noe Viejo,93,45.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Pedro Ximénez,González Byass
70350,Spain,"Smooth up front, with a light veil of oak sitting on top of black fruit. In the mouth, flavors of raspberry and plum satisfy in a juicy, medium-depth sort of way, while the finish is cushioned by chocolate and vanilla notes. A crianza that gets it right.",Conde de Valdemar Crianza,87,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Valdemar
70351,US,"A very pretty Pinot, and while it's not terribly complicated or ageworthy, it's one of those wines that goes gently with almost anything you serve it with. Dry and elegant, its flavors veer toward cherries, tobacco and herbs.",,87,30.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Bouchaine
70352,France,"This 100% Syrah is filled with effusive bright berry fruit, liberally seasoned with a dusting of cracked pepper. It's a little light, but offers an easy-to-drink authentic taste of the northern Rhône at a realistic price.",Les Peyrouses,87,17.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône,,Syrah,Alain Voge
70353,US,"A solid effort. Dry, delicately silky and elegant, this polished wine shows flavors of red cherries, raspberries, cola and rosehip tea, with an Asian spice finish. Pair with steak.",Reserve,87,25.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kenwood
70354,Italy,"An extra year in the bottle has helped define this wine's mineral qualities, which are reinforced by aromas of citrus, lime lollipop and jasmine. Detectable sweetness suggests an excellent pairing with exotic or spicy foods.",Afix,87,39.0,Northeastern Italy,Delle Venezie,,Riesling,Jermann
70355,Chile,"Quite fruity and soothing as Chilean Chardonnay goes. The nose is stocked with swaying peach, apple and pear aromas, while the rich palate features much of the same, with a dusting of cinnamon. Round and ready to drink right away.",La Palma Reserva,87,10.0,Cachapoal Valley,,,Chardonnay,Viña La Rosa
70356,South Africa,"Subtle oak, strawberry, raspberry and mocha flavors come together in a rich swirl in this unique Pinotage.

70357,France,"From the domaine's young vines, this offering features somewhat restrained aromatics, with just traces of violets and blackberries. But on the palate there's plenty of cassis fruit. No, it's not that rich or lush, but it's pure, supple and easy to drink right out of the gate. Drink now–2012.",Chaillot,87,78.0,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Syrah,Thierry Allemand
70358,US,"Pretty good Sauv Blanc, a little one-dimensional, but satisfies for its flowery, citrus blossom and passionfruit flavors that finish in a swirl of palate-stimulating spices.",Dutton Ranch Cohen Vineyard,87,18.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dutton Estate
70359,New Zealand,"This has all the Riesling basics: crushed-stone and lime aromas, citrus zest and melon rind flavors and a zippy, fresh finish. There's an almost crystalline quality to this wine's fruit, a slightly hard, teutonic edge that snaps the taster to attention rather than seducing with charm.",,87,14.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Allan Scott
70360,US,"With 14% Gewürztraminer in the blend, and almost 2% residual sugar, this is a popular tasting-room wine. It's got a lightly pleasing streak of tea, and if you like a little lemon in your ice tea you'll like this wine. Clean and showing surprising length, it should be chilled down to boost its backbone.",,87,9.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Riesling,Hogue
70361,France,Slightly waxy aromas of paraffin are followed by hints of melon and spice on the nose. The palate is comprised of cinnamon and clove with a secondary burst of citrus shining through. A long and slightly honeyed finish completes this broad and mouthfilling selection.,Jubilee Hugel,87,53.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Hugel
70362,New Zealand,"A stalwart of the New Zealand Riesling firmament, Kim Crawford's 2006 version is a solid effort that boasts some beautiful pink-grapefruit aromas and flavors. Ultimately, this lacks a bit of complexity, but it nicely balances sugar and acid in a plump, easy-to-drink wine with no hard edges.",Dry,87,17.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Kim Crawford
70363,US,"Soft and ripe, this Cab has polished cherry, blackberry and black raspberry flavors, enriched with spicy, toasty oak.

Drink now.",Bates Ranch Vineyard,87,35.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Byington
70364,France,"This is a great example of what more inexpensive Bordeaux could be like with proper care in the vineyards and winery. Scents of chocolate, dried herbs and cassis ease into similar flavors, carried on a medium-weight, slightly creamy palate. Turns spicy and firmer on the finish, suggesting it will last until 2010 or so.",L'Abbaye de Saint Ferme Les Vignes du Soir,87,11.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Supérieur,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Domaines Arnaud de Raignac
70365,France,"Although there's only about 20% new oak used in this cuvée, it is somewhat apparent on the nose and palate, where cedar, cinnamon and clove take the lead. There's some pretty—some might say Burgundian—fruit, but it's a touch light and herbal.",Seigneur de Maugiron,87,73.0,Rhône Valley,Côte Rôtie,,Syrah,Delas Frères
70366,Chile,"Cola, coffee and leathery dark-fruit aromas carry the bouquet. Next comes a palate of snappy cherry and raspberry fruit that's neither flat nor flabby. Call it a little racy and rambunctious if you will, but better that it dances on your tongue rather than falling asleep.",Reserva,87,9.0,Rapel Valley,,,Carmenère,Chilcas
70367,Italy,"This is textbook Riesling with clean citrus aromas and good intensity through and through. Background flavors of almond skin and stone fruit add depth and character. In the mouth, this is smooth and silky with a touch of sweetness.",Montiggl,87,18.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Riesling,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano
70368,Spain,"Color and size are readily apparent but gaps appear between the layers. For starters, the nose doesn't have the purity and density that it could; and the palate also shows some weakness where structure and quality of fruit meet. Otherwise, it's a ripe and modern red wine with some lushness and depth.",Mirto,87,65.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
70369,Portugal,"At three years, Ramos-Pinto's branded Adriano (named after the founder of the company) is at its best. This 2004 vintage is big-hearted, with bitter chocolate and blackberry fruits, as well as generous tannins. Good, dry structure and fresh acidity complete a rounded picture.",Adriano,87,13.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Ramos-Pinto
70370,New Zealand,"With more than 20g/L residual sugar, you might expect this wine to be rather sweet, but because of its high acidity it only registers as off dry. Lime and grapefruit flavors are flecked with green apple and petrol, finishing soft but with a citrusy edge. Drink now.",Cellar Selection,87,19.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Villa Maria
70371,South Africa,"Raspberry and cherry pervade in this well-rounded Pinotage, which exhibits touches of plum and that spciy dryness that typifies the variety. The fruit keeps the edges soft though, and the wine is structured but balanced. Pair with smoked meat or enjoy on its own—it's an embraceable Pinotage from a dependable producer. Imported by Quintessential Family of Wines, LLC.",,87,14.0,Stellenbosch,,,Pinotage,Simonsig
70372,US,"Crisp acidity fortunately balances this sweet dessert wine, with honeyed cherry, tangerine and apricot preserves, smoky meringue and vanilla fudge flavors. It's easy and delicious, and if there were an extra depth of fruity intensity, it would earn a near-perfect score.",,87,21.0,California,California,California Other,Moscato,St. Supéry
70373,New Zealand,"Plump and round, with some residual sugar a distinct possibility, this wine boasts honey and melon flavors, accented with just enough tomato-leaf herbaceousness to maintain its varietal character. Drink now.",,87,12.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Newhaven
70374,US,"A good follow-up to the 2005, though not as ripe and rich. The lemon-drop flavors are thinned out, and the 3% residual sugar is down by a full percentage point. This is firm, tangy and crisp, but does not have the concentration to carry it to the next level. It seems to hit a plateau and sit there through the finish.",Champoux Vineyard,87,22.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Riesling,OS Winery
70375,Portugal,"Vallado's simplest wine is all big, black, crisp fruit leaping out of the glass. While it is not light, it certainly has a lilt and freshness to it, despite the dry tannins which underlie the flavors. Herbs and spices add to the pleasure.",,87,20.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Vallado
70376,France,"A forwardly fruity, lightly mineral wine, all freshness and white berry fruits, elegant and well-balanced with the crisp, apple acidity. A great apéritif style of Sancerre.",,87,25.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Pascal Jolivet
70377,Spain,"Round, clean and a touch leathery, but not penetrating or dense. For a nice, smooth red wine with some plum and cinnamon spice, look no further. This crianza is easygoing, lightly oaked and good throughout.",Crianza,87,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Marqués de Cáceres
70378,France,"A full, rounded wine, with flavors of asparagus, herbs and ripe quinces. There's acidity, some yeastiness and a taut structure. This probably needs another 6 months aging—drink over the winter 2007/8.",La Moynerie,87,24.0,Loire Valley,Pouilly-Fumé,,Sauvignon Blanc,Michel Redde et Fils
70379,Australia,"Nicely complex on the nose, offering up dusty, minerally notes alongside baked apple. Flavors feature some petrol notes, but also honey and preserved citrus, ending a little short. Drink now.",The Y Series,87,11.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Riesling,Yalumba
70380,Italy,"Delicate and subdued, there's an attractive herbal or menthol quality to this wine that is reinforced by cracked black pepper, tobacconists' shop and mint tea. Candy-like cherry in the mouth with a clean, crisp finish make this an immediately approachable, casual Brunello. Imported by Distillerie Stock USA, Ltd.",,88,65.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Casanuova delle Cerbaie
70381,Australia,"I like this wine for what it isn't—brash or sweet. Tannins are smooth and manageable, with mushroom and stable notes accenting firm plum and cherry flavors. A little soft on the palate, with a bite of herb at the finish, but it's nearly as enjoyable as the winery's excellent Cabernet. Imported by Southern Starz, Inc.",,88,17.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,Merlot,Margan
70382,Italy,"There's a tutti-frutti glossiness to this wine that helps liven understated aromas such as light coffee, rose pedal, white cherry, cinnamon and violet. Well-structured and constructed with tight, sour tannins on the end.",Pertimali,88,,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Livio Sassetti
70383,Australia,Plum and berry fruit on the palate are juicy but fairly main stream; pretty notes of spice accent roasted blackberry aromas. Textured tannins add interest on the finish.,Reserve,88,59.0,Victoria,Nagambie Lakes,,Shiraz,Tahbilk
70384,US,"From a small vineyard at the winery, a fascinating wine of place. It's black as night, dry as dust and so tannic, it shuts down the palate. Chew on it, and you'll find deep, ripe black raspberry flavors of great purity. It's worth cellaring this puppy for a good five years and possibly longer.",,88,40.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Petit Verdot,Trinchero
70385,US,"Oaky, supple and structured, this features fresh green apple fruit and plenty of toasty new oak. It's just well made, mostly barrel-fermented (one-third was new French oak) and captures the broad, fruit-driven, barrel-enhanced flavors that make Chardonnay so popular.",,88,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Waterbrook
70386,Spain,"Full and ripe, with tobacco and a certain earthy nuttiness to the nose. Raspberry and plum are the leading flavors, while the mouthfeel is both textured as well as juicy.

70387,US,"John Duval makes this satiny and very smooth Syrah for the Long Shadows collective. It's got strong coffee-accented flavors, along with fairly astringent tannins.

The blend includes 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, from vineyards scattered across the state.",,88,55.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Sequel
70388,US,"Pure Merlot, dark and sappy, with juicy, perfectly ripe boysenberry, blackberry and black cherry fruit. It offers plenty of spice, along with the ripe fruit flavors.

70390,Spain,"Spicy and saucy on the nose, with some leather and cherry mixed in. Shows attractive cherry and tobacco flavors, and they are supported by ripe, pure tannins.

70392,US,"A roughly 50-50 blend that comes across with firm, melon-flavored fruit—honeydew, green apple, Asian pear. Brief aging in new 500-liter puncheons gives it just a kiss of toast. 223 cases were made.",,88,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay-Viognier,Chelan Estate
70393,Australia,"It's a good thing that the weather is warming up, because this is just the kind of wine that you want in a chiller out on the deck.

70395,US,"Still young, fresh and vibrant, this Cab also is still dense in tannins, so be forewarned, although it's nothing that rich fare can't handle. It seems to be built for the cellar. The only concern is an overripe raisiny taste that would limit ageability.",Hilltop Vineyard,88,32.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,J. Lohr
70396,US,The rosé is especially nice; with a pretty cherry core of sweet fruit. Basically it is free run (saignée) juice with a smidgen (two percent of  still wine added to brighten the color.

70397,US,"What's likeable about this wine is that it doesn't go for the cheap thrills of superripe fruit and form of oak flavoring so common in Chards of this price.

70398,US,"Lots of spritz and a forward, peachy, fruit-driven set of flavors; almost like a Prosecco but with a bit more concentration and powerful, peachy fruit.

70400,US,"This Bordeaux blend (62% Cab, 33% Merlot and 5% Cab Franc) comes from the great Champoux Vineyard in an excellent vintage.

70402,Spain,"Gets off the blocks with Middle Eastern spice notes of cumin and curry, but later on open-cut wood and vanilla take over.

70414,US,"Drinkable now, but has the structure for the cellar. Grown in a Forestville vineyard from modern Dijon clones, it's very fruity, offering clean, pure flavors of cherries, raspberries, blueberries and spices.

Beautiful now with decanting, and should develop through 2013.",Tobias Glen,93,54.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
70415,France,"An astonishing nose of peach and bramble with refreshing accents of lemon zest. The intense, off-dry palate of pistachio, pecan and apricot lead to a long, minerally finish.

70416,France,"Profound enough for serious contemplation but with enough broad fruit appeal to serve to a crowd. There's loads of upfront Asian spice and lychee, afloat on a luxurious, sensually textured palate. Notes of geranium and macadamia nuts keep the taste buds entertained and carry over to the lingering finish. The noticeable residual sugar suggests pairing with something slightly sweet, like Tilapia in a mango salsa. Drink now to 2011.",Wintzheim,92,48.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht

70423,US,"The 2008 Pinots from Ken Wright display their individual terroirs quite succinctly, with little evidence of the (roughly) 30% new oak they receive.

70425,US,"Laurent and Danielle Montalieu acquired this high-profile vineyard in 2007; this is the first Hyland release under their Soléna label.

70429,US,"Showing the usual balance and harmony of this bottling, which is made from the five Bordeaux varieties, the '06 nonetheless lacks a bit of the richness of other vintages.

70431,New Zealand,"The bulkiness that characterized earlier vintages of this Merlot-based blend has been tamed in this vintage, and the 2007 is a remarkably harmonious, elegant blend of ripe cherries, dried spices, chocolate and cedar.

70451,Chile,"Licorice, mint and black plum aromas foreshadow somewhat tart, snappy fruit flavors.

70454,Chile,"The color and mouthfeel is fine. But the aromas and flavors offer more bramble and vegetal characteristics than is ideal.

70465,Chile,"A heavier, fuller more complex style of Sauvignon, reflected in the high price tag. The nose offers ripe pineapple, passion fruit and touches of green bean and canned peas.

Technically off-dry, this has the acidity and focus to be most flexible with a wide variety of Asian foods.",,92,16.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Southern Oregon,Gewürztraminer,Brandborg
70473,France,"Intensely rich in character, touched lightly by new wood, the acidity crispening the ripe orange and sweet peach skin texture. This is a gorgeous, opulent wine.",,92,,Bordeaux,Barsac,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Doisy-Védrines
70474,New Zealand,"Dry River doesn't get a ton of press for its Chardonnay, but this is a terrific example of what Martinborough can do. Restrained toast and oak-spice elements complement fruits that range from melon to apple and citrus. It's medium in body, with a long, crisp, citrusy finish. Drink it over the next 5–6 years.",,92,60.0,Martinborough,,,Chardonnay,Dry River
70475,US,"Very rich and extracted, with massive flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants that taste like they were baked into a pastry, and sprinkled with cocoa, anise, vanilla and a touch of salt and black pepper. Delicious and forward, and should hold steady over the next six years.",,92,60.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Coniglio
70476,US,"A beautiful Merlot, actually one of the best ones out there now. Shows a brilliant Napa structure, with refined tannins housing red cherry, red currant, cola and cedar flavors nicely grounded with a touch of fine herbs and violets. A lovely, gentler alternative to Cabernet with a fine steak.",,92,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Madorom
70477,US,"Tough and chewy now, with a fibrous, tannic mouthfeel like a bite of beef jerky. Similar flavors, too, of teriaki beef, but the underlying fruit is massive, offering waves of cherries, black raspberries, currants and cola. This is a very fine wine, but an immature one. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar, if you can keep your hands off.",Coopersmith,92,54.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
70478,US,"Marked by strong, dry tannins now, which lock it down and make it astringent through the finish. Yet beneath the toughness is plenty of ripe fruit, with waves of blackberries and black currants. Oak shows up as toast, and also contributes to the tannins. Nowhere near ready, this wine should begin to come into its own after 2011.",Sycamore Vineyard,92,70.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Freemark Abbey
70479,Italy,This Millesimato sparkling blend of Pinot Nero and oak-aged Chardonnay delivers a generous and creamy mouthfeel followed by refined aromas of dried fruit and baked bread. This is a beautiful wine to serve with tempura appetizers.,Millesimato Brut,92,52.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,La Montina
70480,US,"Interesting flavors in this dry Rhône-style blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah. They range from cherries, red currants and raspberries to teriaki beef, bacon, cola and buttered cinnamon toast, with all sorts of exotic Asian spices. It's quite a tannic wine, and very dry. Shows a certain nobility, but you'll want to decant it, even overnight, to let it breathe.",Cuvée Constantine,92,40.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,Demetria
70481,US,"Peju's regular Cab Franc, released a year ago, was immediately drinkable. This reserve, with a tiny case production, is denser and more tannic, but shows the same charm. It's a fat, fleshy wine, with luscious black cherry tart, cola and caramelized oak flavors. Fine now, and should develop for 5–7 years.",Reserve Estate Bottled,92,95.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Franc,Peju
70482,South Africa,"Assertive and intense with a dark cocoa, black cherry and violet nose, this wine is smooth, dark and mysterious. Black fruit, warming spice and a touch of tobacco unfold on the palate, and the finish is lush and lingering. An elegant, sultry wine with aging potential.",,92,40.0,Stellenbosch,,,Shiraz,Muratie
70483,US,"A lovely wine that makes the case for bottling Cab Franc on its own. Shows beautifully ripe, fine Napa tannins with complex flavors of red cherries, red currants, licorice, cola and cedar. Think of it as a Cabernet Sauvignon that's lighter in body and more elegant.",Estate Bottled,92,45.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Franc,William Harrison
70484,Spain,"Rich and pruney, with bold, reduced black fruit aromas along with chocolate and spice. Compact and delicious in the mouth, with caramel, black coffee and other yummy, unctuous flavors. So thick it pours like motor oil, thus feel free to drink it like a wine or pour it on vanilla ice cream as you might a syrup.",Don Guido Aged 20 Years Rare Old Sweet,92,50.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Pedro Ximénez,Williams & Humbert
70485,US,"Marked by a lean minerality, this Chablis-style wine is not one of those fat, opulent Chards that dazzles with sheer richness. It's more subtle than that, and more acidic. Structure, in fact, is the name of the game here, with its lemon and lime flavors that barely break into green apples. Fine now, if not served too cold, and for the next 2–4 years. Beyond that, wines of this kind go quickly downhill.",Hat Trick Double L Vineyard,92,65.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Morgan
70486,US,"Very consistent in style with previous vintages, this textural, lemony, racy Riesling seems bone dry, though it is noted as having 1% residual sugar. Along with rich flavors of grapefruit and citrus, there are nectarine and pear fruit highlights and a sharp minerality.",Corral Creek,92,24.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Riesling,Chehalem
70487,France,"There are big flavors of botrytis here, giving a wine with power and concentration. The texture is muscular, tightness surrounding botrytis and layering with pineapple acidity and apricots.",,92,,Bordeaux,Sauternes,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Rabaud-Promis
70488,US,"Mainly Syrah, with a splash of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Viognier, this polished wine is marked by things that are red: red cherries, red currants and red licorice. It's dry, full bodied and tannic. When you swallow, astrigency remains behind, with the aftertaste of crushed red pepper. Lovely and complex, it's a wine to decant.",North Slope Estate,92,35.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,Demetria
70489,US,"Pure and detailed, this lovely Chardonnay carves its way through the palate with layers of pear tart, apple crisp, brioche and almond paste. It is an elegant wine, light and penetrating, with a finish that seems to linger forever.",Summum,92,100.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay,Evening Land
70490,Italy,"From the distant 2004 vintage, this pink and peach-colored sparkler offers yeasty tones of freshly baked bread and subtle notes of red berries and apricot. The wine is tonic and firm in the mouth with a creamy, foamy aftertaste. Beautiful and delicate.",Perlé Rosé Brut,92,60.0,Northeastern Italy,Trento,,Sparkling Blend,Ferrari
70491,US,"Dramatic in depth and structure, a cool-climate Syrah that will benefit from some time in the cellar. Deeply saturated in color, bone dry and full bodied, it offers ripe flavors of blackberries and black currants, with plenty of black pepper and sweet, chewy leather. Now, with decanting, and through 2013.",Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard,92,35.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Dutton-Goldfield
70492,France,"A big, solid wine, foursquare and chunky. The fruit directs its plum fruit flavors to richness, some sweetness, with coffee and licorice as added complexity. There is a great tight wood element giving dryness.",Château Tour Blanche,92,20.0,Bordeaux,Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Bernard Magrez
70493,Italy,"Here's a pale pink sparkler that would serve beautifully at weddings and special outdoor occasions. The wine is delicate and tonic, with pretty aromas of small berries and yeasty bread. It is firm, refreshing and extremely elegant on the close.",Gran Cuvée Brut Rosé,92,,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,Bellavista
70494,Italy,"There are impressive aromas here of stone and passion fruits, dried herbs and thick, nutty overtones at the back. The acidity is refreshing and cool but the wine also boasts solid, firm structure. Try this sparkler with smoked salmon canapés.",Gran Cuvée Satèn,92,,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Chardonnay,Bellavista
70495,US,"A beautiful Zin, dry and spicy. Shows lush, intricate flavors of blackberries, black raspberries, anise, pepper, cola and cedar. A very fine interpretation of a dusty Sonoma Zinfandel.",Branham Rockpile Vineyard,92,30.0,California,Rockpile,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hobo
70496,Italy,"Here's a complex and sophisticated sparkler with beautiful aromas of stone fruit, freshly baked bread, pressed flowers and crushed white pepper. The wine tastes rich and thick in the mouth and ends with piquant effervescence.",Gran Cuvée Pas Operé Extra Brut,92,,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,Bellavista
70497,US,This barrel selection from the best estate vineyards is given just 10 months aging in 30% new oak. The fruit is exceptional – a mix of red berries with tasteful threads of caramel sneaking into the finish. Let it breathe—it's a baby—but very nicely proportioned and showing layers of detail throughout a lingering finish.,Elizabeth's Reserve,92,48.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Adelsheim
70498,US,"Hobo's Zins are almost always among the most balanced and elegant out there, while preserving the variety's spicy, briary personality. This lovely single-vineyard bottling is dry and refined, showing complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, blueberries and spices. Drink now.",Treborce Vineyard,92,30.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hobo
70499,US,"Doesn't have quite the sheer ravishing power of the winery's Trace Ridge Cabernet, but this Cab-based Bordeaux blend is nuanced and possibly more complex and Bordeaux-like. The flavors are of currants, blackberries, cherries, anise and cedar, aged in 78% new French oak. Give it until 2011 to mellow.",Highlands Estates Trace Ridge,92,75.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Kendall-Jackson
70500,Spain,"This is an easy, sweeter style of Viura that emits aromas of peaches and pears. The palate is lively enough but not exactly zesty, and the flavors run toward pink grapefruit and other citrus fruits; but think sweet, nice fruits—not sour ones. Has all the hallmarks of a good aperitif wine.",Cosecha,86,11.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,White Blend,Ostatu
70501,Portugal,"A fresh, lively, citrus-flavored wine with touches of white peaches and a soft structure. Give this 6 months in bottle for the freshness to peak.",Adriano,86,13.0,Douro,,,Portuguese White,Ramos-Pinto
70502,Australia,"From a hilly portion of Western Victoria, this wine is a little softer in style than many other Aussie Rieslings. It still has plenty of lime and wet stone scents, but there's also a slightly confected, bubble-gum-like quality. Drink now.",Chockstone,86,20.0,Victoria,Grampians,,Riesling,A.T. Richardson
70503,US,"This is one of the softer Chappellet Cabs, and whether it's because of the hot vintage or a change in winemaking, it's not in the same league as the '02 and '03. Tastes like a melted chocolate bar, with a squeeze of crème de cassis and licorice, and of course new toasted oak. Just too soft. Drink now.",Signature,86,46.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chappellet
70504,Chile,This Sauvignon Blanc shows some true Chilean character; there's pungency and snap to it. The palate hits with solid citrus and then pineapple and green apple notes take over on the finish. Shows balance at all checkpoints.,Reserva,86,11.0,Curicó Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Caliterra
70505,Spain,"Racy on the nose, with tea, pepper and pine scents along with basic red-fruit aromas. The palate is zingy and fairly trim, with strawberry and raspberry flavors. Finishes fresh and snappy, with a shot of tartness. Drink now. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Gran Reserva,86,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
70506,US,"Pretty good wine, but a little rough right now. May develop, but no guarantees. It has rich chocolate and cassis flavors and plenty of oak, but is also very tannic, leaving a gum-numbing astringency on the slightly sweet finish. Try stashing it for a year or so, then try again.",Single Vineyard Estate,86,50.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ilsley
70507,France,"While Redde is based in Pouilly, across the Loire, the family does have vines in Sancerre. This 2005 is a light, yeasty wine, with grassy, herbal flavors and a crisp, intense acidity to finish.",Les Tuilières,86,25.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Michel Redde et Fils
70508,Chile,"With a bouquet of pears and baked fruits, this medium-weight, mildly oaked Chard has what it takes to reel you in. The palate answers the bell with sweet peach and pear flavors, and the finish holds its course. Overall it's a simple, tasty fruitball of a Chard.",Classic Series,86,12.0,Curicó Valley,,,Chardonnay,Montes
70509,US,"Softly fruited with peaches, nectarines and honeysuckles, this pleasant sipper has just a touch of sweetness in the background. Best of all is the acidity, which is brisk and mouth-cleansing.",,86,14.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Riesling,Koehler
70510,US,"Good everyday dry white, clean and zesty in juicy acids, with citrus fruit and spice flavors and a fine vinosity. An interesting blend of French Columbard, Semillon, Chenin Blanc and Chardonnay.",White Old Vines,86,13.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,White Blend,Ladybug
70511,France,"In this challenging vintage, Colombo's entry-level Cornas is a bit lean and tart, turning crisp and cranberry-like despite having 14% alcohol. Cherry, sandalwood and vanilla flavors are pleasant enough, just without the warmth and flesh of a warmer year.",Terre Brûlées,86,78.0,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Syrah,Jean-Luc Colombo
70512,South Africa,"Cabernet and Pinotage give this a hearty edge, but balanced oak and vanilla flavors soften the punch. Add to the toast a mélange of blackberry, plum and currant flavors and the result is a classic wine with character.",Akira,86,16.0,Stellenbosch,,,Red Blend,Umkhulu
70513,Chile,"Here's an unusual mix of Syrah and Carignan that runs lean and racy. The nose offers more spice and leather than ripeness, while the palate is downright tangy and teetering on sharp. Freshness and power are not issues; but it might be too tangy and citrusy for anyone expecting a beefy, extracted wine.",Eclat,86,26.0,Maule Valley,,,Red Blend,Valdivieso
70514,Chile,"This medium-bodied Chard leads with healthy oak-based aromas of toast and vanilla, and there's also some warm radiator dust along with baked apple and pear scents. It's a round-styled wine with apple and melon flavors, and the finish yields mostly toast and vanilla. Still alive and kicking courtesy of core acidity.",Reserve,86,12.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Chardonnay,Montes
70515,US,"Kind of on the light side, but it shows the Highlands character of crispness, elegance, dryness and varietal purity. With its thinned-down cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors, it lets you put a Morgan Pinot Noir on your table for less than any of its other bottlings.",Twelve Clones,86,30.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Morgan
70516,New Zealand,"A light, dry style of Riesling—clean and refreshing—with simple green apple and citrus flavors. It's leaner and more linear than most Marlborough Rieslings, making it a solid bet with raw shellfish.",,86,15.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Omaka Springs
70517,US,"Dark and thick in the way of Malbec, this is big, rich and gooey, powerful in chocolate fudge, blackberry jam, licorice and smoky oak flavors. It's not particularly complicated or ageworthy, but it's softly delicious.",,86,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Malbec,Rutherford Hill
70518,Chile,"More from the big, friendly school of Syrahs, although a little generic in the final analysis. The bouquet is rich and a touch syrupy, but the palate features a solid core of ripe, deep black fruits. Not perfect but shows plenty of flavor, width, weight and fruit.",Reserva,86,12.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Syrah,Porta
70519,Portugal,"A structured, ripe wine, leavened with a base of dry tannins. It is full of ripe blueberry fruit flavors and juicy freshness. A little stalky, but easy, soft and ready to drink.",Adriano,86,13.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Ramos-Pinto
70520,France,"Full, ripe fruit, flavored with green plum skins and gooseberries. There's great fresh acidity, but there is also a good structure suggesting the wine will age another year. Attractive weight as well.",,86,22.0,Loire Valley,Pouilly-Fumé,,Sauvignon Blanc,Remy-Pannier
70521,US,"Soft and somewhat simple, with lots of liqueur-like cherry, cassis, chocolate, coffee, spice and oak flavors, but not much structure. Best now.",Alliage,86,26.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Byington
70522,US,"From Evergreen vineyards. This is all stainless and rather sweet, touching 4% residual sugar. Despite that, the underlying acids keep the wine reasonably crisp and buoyant. Flavors of cotton candy, strawberry lollipop and sweet watermelon make this a perfect summer sipper.",,86,17.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Riesling,Cedergreen Cellars
70523,Chile,"Perfectly good Cab is what you get here. The nose deals some char and leather, but largely it features clean fruit scents. The palate may be a bit short, but along the way the flavors of cassis and berries are commendable. Well done for a value wine.",,86,7.0,Central Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chilensis
70524,Australia,"Starts off with smoke and apple scents, then adds flavors that are crisp and citrusy, with a touch of pineapple. It's a clean, refreshing style of Chardonnay without too much vanilla or toast.",,86,14.0,New South Wales,Orange,,Chardonnay,Climbing

70526,US,"Here's a nice cocktail-style wine that pleases for its dryness and crispness. It's basically a simple quaffer, with no oak at all, and rewards for fresh, ripe pineapple, Meyer lemon, fig and date flavors. Try with your best homemade Ahi tuna tartare.",,86,16.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Honig
70527,US,"This is a country-style wine. Dry and satisfying, it shows rich tannins and soft acids framing cherry, blackberry and cola flavors. Easy to sip with burgers or roast chicken.",,86,20.0,California,Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Petite Sirah,Guenoc
70528,US,"I love the silkiness and delicacy that defines this Pinot's mouthfeel. Also nice is the dryness. Taste-wise, it could use more concentration, as the rhubarbs, pomegranates and cola are a little thin and weedy.",Iund Vineyard,86,30.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Harrington
70529,Italy,"This cooler climate Pinot Grigio is elegant and pristine with fine notes of citrus, stone fruit, peach and white stone. The mouthfeel is lean, watery and refreshing.",,86,25.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Pinot Grigio,Santa Margherita
70530,US,"The private project of veteran winemaker Robert Brittan, the limited-production wines under his own label are treasures. This is his inaugural release. Both fruit ripeness and meaty depth are here in abundance, with a complex mix of tree fruits and stone fruits, streaks of earth and a fine layering of chocolate. This is a wine you excavate as much as drink; it's full of surprises.",Basalt Block,92,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Brittan Vineyards
70531,France,"A rustic wine, with definite barnyard flavors. The fruit has some smoky extract, but the tannins and old wood tastes intrude too much.",Prestige,92,19.0,Bordeaux,Fronsac,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château les Tonnelles
70532,France,"Fine ripe flavors, combine elegance with rich, opulent Merlot fruits. There is a strong jelly element here in the sweet fruit, but there are also tannins and a firm, dry texture. The final fruit is black, intense.",,92,,Bordeaux,Pomerol,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Vray Croix de Gay
70533,New Zealand,"My favorite of Grant Taylor's 2008s, the Bannockburn bottling displays elegant lacings of vanilla and cinnamon over black cherries, then adds subtle meaty and herbal nuances. It's medium bodied and supple in texture, with a long, silky finish. Drink now–2015.",Bannockburn Vineyard,92,55.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Valli
70534,US,"A very fine wine that strikes just the right balance in a white Bordeaux-style wine. It's fruity in the California style, with ripe citrus, apple and peach flavors. The richness is balanced with zesty acidity, and there's a dry, steely minerality that makes it particularly savory.",SETA,92,32.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,Signorello
70535,US,"This is one of the best Mourvèdres in recent memory. It has the silky texture of Pinot Noir, yet is full bodied in fruity tannins, and most importantly feels clean and vibrant throughout. Shows exciting flavors of cherries and raspberries, with a meaty note of grilled beef splashed with soy sauce. Lovely now with a great grilled steak.",Bendicion,92,40.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Mourvèdre,Oso Libre
70536,France,"While not strictly part of the Haut-Médoc Château Cambon la Pelouse, this small parcel in Margaux is under the same ownership and vinification.

70537,Italy,"Sparkling wines like this “Dosaggio Zero” (made from 50-50 Chardonnay and Pinot Nero) show the best of the territory they come from and promise to pair with a long list of foods.

70544,Spain,"A genuinely attractive, well-made old vines red with earthy, minerally aromas along with violet petal and blackberry.

70545,US,"This opens with a very pretty nose—scents of clay, mineral, blueberry, cassis and a whiff of rather high-toned volatility. In the mouth the barrel flavors bring dusty cocoa and chocolate. A full-bodied wine, still young, sharp and edgy. Best to give it a few more years in the cellar, to smooth out some of the rawness.",Jerusalem Hill,91,75.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Domaine Serene
70546,US,"Tart, tangy, and herbal, this juicy wine mixes cranberry and strawberry fruit with tomato leaf, herb and peppery spice.

But the balance, length and detail are delightful.",Gestalt Block,91,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Brittan Vineyards
70547,New Zealand,"There's a slightly floral, stemmy note to this wine, which accents its bold, almost sweetly fruity nature.

Drink now–2015.",Calvert,91,65.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Felton Road
70548,US,"This soft and seductive wine is reminiscent of a good Chassagne-Montrachet from a relatively warm year. It has the same ripe, lightly tropical fruit, inflected with citrus and buoyed by firm acidity.

70549,France,"In contrast to the château wine, this reserve from Château Lamothe-Cissac is for aging. It is still firmly tannic, solid and dark with big ripe fruit and spice from the wood. It holds together well, very balanced. Give it five years.",Vieilles Vignes Réserve,91,30.0,Bordeaux,Haut-Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Lamothe-Cissac

70553,France,"Big, rich, dusty tannins and black plum fruits are built on a firm layer of wood. There is a fresh mint character as well, giving the wine a polished and spicy feel. With the wood and the acidity, this needs aging: 3–4 years and more.",Réserve,91,,Bordeaux,Graves,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Haut Selve
70554,Italy,"This wine is a result of careful winemaking in which both oak barrel and aging on the lees is used to render a rounder, creamier feel in the mouth.

70556,US,"Bella Vetta's 2005 was very good. This 2006 is easily on a par. It's a ripe, plush wine, filled with blackberry, currant and sweet oak flavors with a savory tease of leather that may be a touch of brett, but it acts as a spice. And look how modern techniques have tamed those fierce Howell Mountain tannins. The mouthfeel is sheer velvet.",Ami's Vineyard,91,29.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bella Vetta
70557,New Zealand,"Supple but structured, this is only the third vintage for Felton Road's Cornish Point Pinot and it is really starting to hit its stride. Touches of hickory smoke and mocha accent the dark plum and savory fruit, finishing long, spicy and with a note of brown-sugar sweetness.",Cornish Point,91,65.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Felton Road
70558,Italy,"Ferrari's Brut Perlé (made with 100% Chardonnay) offers soft, foamy perlage that enhances a sense of softness and fullness on the palate. Crisp and tonic, it drinks very well but it leaves enough body and persistency to fuel a long finish.",Brut Perlé,91,32.0,Northeastern Italy,Trento,,Chardonnay,Ferrari
70559,Germany,This wine is a shining example of the glorious minerality that singles out Mosel Riesling. The nose shows really appealing pear and gardenia scents overlaying wet stone notes. The mouthwatering acidity wakes up your palate and is in perfect balance with the substantial residual sugar. Drink now (with sushi) or hold five or more years for even more complexity.,Erdener Treppchen Spätlese,91,30.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Dr. Loosen
70560,Chile,"Aromas of roasted coffee, asphalt and pepper give the black cherry, olive and bell pepper scents some character. In the mouth, we find leafy red fruit along with olive flavors, while the texture is juicy and lively. No dead weight or balance issues; but it is a bit green.",Medalla Real Special Reserve,86,19.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Rita
70561,Portugal,"This is one of Portugal's big brands. Soft, easy and juicy, this has  just a touch of dryness and great, fresh aftertaste.",Periquita,86,10.0,Terras do Sado,,,Portuguese Red,José Maria da Fonseca
70562,France,"Minerality, peach, melon and sweet pea give way to a fuller bodied mouthfeel with strong intensity. Tropical and honeyed, the finish falls a little short, needing a tinge more acidity to lift those heavy flavors.",,86,27.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Domaine Marcel Deiss
70563,France,"Stone dust and ripe green apple fill the nose and palate of this easygoing quaff. A pleasing lemon finish balances the intensity and medium weight, making this a nice, solid selection.",Grand Cru Kessler,86,33.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Domaines Schlumberger
70564,Germany,"A medium-bodied dry Riesling, this offers rather simple, fruity flavors of apple and pineapple. Although it lacks a great deal of complexity, it's well-balanced and harmonious; easy to drink.",Hochheimer Kirchenstück Spätlese Trocken,86,25.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Domdechant Werner
70565,Spain,"A throwback Rioja that sports tobacco, mulch and some true Old-World aromas that make you question the wine's health. But airing breathes life and tilts it toward dried cherries. Finally you discover core power hammered home by hard tannins, sharp acidity and an odd nuttiness. Not a wine for all tastes.",Reserva,86,30.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Dominio de Conte
70566,Australia,"This light to medium-bodied wine is crisp and refreshing. It may lack some of the power of other Australian Rieslings, but it does offer zesty lime and green apple flavors and a touch of mineral dustiness on the finish. Drink now–2010.",The Dry Dam,86,16.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Riesling,D'Arenberg
70567,US,"The winery does a good job at presenting Syrah made Paso-style, which is to say soft and ripe and pleasant. The '05 shows cherry, blackberry, cassis, coffee and spice flavors, with hints of toasted oak, and the finish is fully dry.",,86,19.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Syrah,Robert Hall
70568,US,"Acidity, the kind that makes the tastebuds bristle, is what makes this semi-sweet Riesling a success. Without it, the ripe apricot, pineapple, peach and honey flavors would be flat and simple. With it, the wine is bright and succulent. A sweet, sugar-glazed ham will be a match made in heaven.",Family,86,10.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Riesling,Trinchero
70569,US,"Off-dry and easy to sip, with honeyed flavors of lemons, peaches, pineapples, wildflowers and spices that are balanced by crisp acidity.",Shooting Star,86,14.0,California,Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Riesling,Steele
70570,South Africa,This is a Merlot that asserts itself rather than hanging back in the wings like many other examples of the variety. Bright fruit flavors and sturdy tannins are rounded out by coffee and spice and an overall integrated character. Not terribly intellectual but definitely fun and full of flavor.,,86,29.0,Stellenbosch,,,Merlot,Thelema
70571,US,"Unusual for an inexpensive Cab of this age to hit the market, and it's a pretty good buy. Nothing complicated, but it's soft and smooth, and beginning to show that magical transformation when primary fruit develops bouquet and a dried fruit character.",,86,16.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Prospero
70572,France,"Flavored with almonds and pistachios, and touched with honey, this is already mature. There's almost a sweetness here, certainly softness, with apricot ripeness.",Domaine de Saint-Pierre,86,,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Pierre Prieur et Fils
70573,Spain,"As always, this gracious white wine made from the Viura grape delivers the goods. In this case, it's pineapple and pear aromas in front of pleasant apple and fresh celery flavors. There's even some honeyed apple to the finish. Light, liquidy and never bad when served properly chilled.",,86,7.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Viura,Marqués de Cáceres
70574,Australia,"Pretty straightforward stuff, with green apple and citrus aromas and just hints of honey and petrol. It's medium-bodied, with a touch of residual sugar, but ends with mouthwatering acids. Drink now–2010.",Gold Label,86,14.0,South Australia,Adelaide,,Riesling,Wolf Blass
70575,Portugal,"A fruity, juicy wine, all ripe raspberries and red plum skins. It is fresh, with a layer of dry tannins, but more fruit than structure.",Aliança Foral,85,8.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Caves Aliança
70576,Chile,"Plenty of barrel char and spice get it going, and behind those aromas there's leather and meaty fruit aromas. Flavors of plum, blackberry and chocolate work the palate, while the finish is easy going and smooth but fairly innocuous in its feel and lasting impression.",Reserva,85,9.0,Rapel Valley,,,Carmenère,Chilensis
70577,France,"Firmly in the Hugel style, with a certain austerity and steeliness to its character. Modest apple and citrus flavors pick up hints of underripe nectarine, finishing with a burst of citrus. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, LTD.",,85,19.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Hugel
70578,US,"Inky dark, dry and velvety soft, it shows deeply ripe, gooey flavors of blackberry jam, spiced coffee, chocolate, licorice and violets. Great with a cheeseburger or lasagna.",,85,10.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Petite Sirah,Ironstone
70579,US,"Some Pinots can handle high alcohol. This one feels hot and sweet, not in sugar but in alcohol and glycerine. It merits this score because the tart-like cherry, cocoapuff and cinnamon flavors taste good, but it really needs greater balance.",Gap's Crown,85,38.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Harrington
70580,US,"Pretty good; a New World-style wine marked by excessive softness and ripeness and delicious, pie-filling flavors, although it's fully dry. Cherries, milk chocolate and root beer dominate, wrapped in soft tannins and acids. Syrah, Grenache, Carignan, Petite Sirah and Alicante Bouschet.",Le Mistral,85,40.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,Joseph Phelps
70581,US,"A disappointment from a winery that's earned Cab scores over 90 for so many years. This one's shy of the mark, a bit thin and weedy in fruit, although it has polished tannins and a nice, dry structure.",,85,42.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Judd's Hill
70582,US,"Not a bad Chard from this warm Central Coast region. It's a little rough around the edges, but is dry and creamy, with a nice mingling of fruit and oaky elements.",Kiara Private Reserve,85,15.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Sylvester
70583,Chile,"From Ventisquero and the Mexican crooner Luis Miguel, this wine has color, heft and size but not a whole lot of finesse or elegance. What it does deliver is rich, basic Cabernet flavors of black cherry and cassis and some toast on the finish. Good but rather regular stuff.",Gran Reserva,85,15.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Único Luis Miguel
70584,Chile,"This wine is already at peak maturity and isn't showing the brightness and spunk that Colchagua Cabernet does when it's young. That said, the wine's cola, dill and butter aromas are reasonably attractive, and the berry and plum flavors, while covered in buttery oak, are round and smooth. Drink now for best results.",Casa La Joya Gran Reserva,85,14.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Viña Bisquertt
70585,Australia,"Light and fresh, with simple but clean and well-crafted apple and citrus flavors. It's a good picnic or lunch wine, paired with chicken salad or grilled chicken breast.",,85,10.0,Australia Other,Central Ranges,,Chardonnay,Rolling
70586,US,"On the sweet side, but balanced with fresh acidity that makes the wine brisk and clean. The polished flavors are of citrus, apricots, peaches, nectarines and spicy apple sauce.",,85,10.0,California,California,California Other,Pinot Grigio,McManis
70587,US,"Strong floral and fruit aromas of apple, pear and apricot, followed by crisp and minerally flavors, typify this Riesling. The wine could use a touch more dimension but the clean, dry flavors will pair very nicely with various dishes—primarily seafood and poultry. There's also a nice spicy spin on the finish that adds to the appeal.",Reserve,85,30.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Dr. Konstantin Frank
70588,US,"Good, everyday red for those who like their Zins briary, brambly and rustic. It's a soul food wine, whose berry-cherry flavors are just short of of raisiny. Not without its faults, but easy and gulpable.",,85,18.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Bridgeway
70589,Spain,"For unafflicted plum and berry character, this young, fresh Rioja has the goods. The sweet berry and cherry palate is at peak drinking condition, and the finish runs longer than expected courtesy of a beam of bright acidity. A wine with Zinfandel-like charm. Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.",Crianza,85,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
70590,New Zealand,"Dry River's 2007 Pinot Noir reveals a slight herbal tinge to its dark fruit aromas and flavors, but it's a nuance that adds complexity and should develop into hints of tea and spice with additional bottle age. As always, it's not overly big or richly textured, but it is concentrated and intense. Drink 2012–2020.",,91,90.0,Martinborough,,,Pinot Noir,Dry River
70591,US,"This is a delight—a supple, polished, ripe and full-throttle Pinot Noir offered at a mid-1990s price. Winemaker Aron Hess keeps the alcohol at 13.5%, the oak a moderate 20% new, and the earthy underpinnings gracefully in check. Lush purple and blue fruits are lightly licked with chocolate; the result is a very satisfying mouthful of wine.",Lia's Vineyard,91,24.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Longplay
70592,Spain,"Rich, dense and syrupy, but also showing touches of mint and leather on the nose. Quite sticky in the mouth, but with lovely toffee and mocha flavors that set up a finish that runs on and on. Impressive depth of flavor, nice overall balance and a mix of complexity and flat-out richness make this PX a winner.",Nectar Dulce,91,18.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Pedro Ximénez,González Byass
70593,US,"Though it seems quite light on first impression, that is a bit deceptive. The biodynamic grapes show a muted earthiness, while over time the cranberry and raspberry flavors gain focus and concentration in the mouth. A graceful, nicely proportioned wine, with some stem and grip to the tannins.",Momtazi Vineyard,91,40.0,Oregon,McMinnville,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Kelley Fox
70594,US,"Bold and striking aromas of mushroom, seaweed and organic funk set this apart from the other Ken Wright vineyard designates. There's plenty of tart, tangy cherry fruit also, though it seems to hit a wall, perhaps due to the recent bottling. This is a wine that could score even higher with additional bottle age.",Meredith Mitchell Vineyard,91,50.0,Oregon,McMinnville,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Ken Wright
70595,New Zealand,"A terrific Pinot Noir value, Stonecrop's 2008 exhibits smoky, cedary aromas, but balances the oak with a solid foundation of cherry fruit and savory, mushroomy complexity. It's full bodied yet elegant, with a meaty finish. Drink now–2013.",,91,24.0,Martinborough,,,Pinot Noir,Stonecrop
70596,US,"Typical of a young, fine Petite Sirah, this bottle is too tannic and unintegrated to drink now. But it has a gigantic heart of blackberries, currants, chocolate, anise, leather and cedar, and should have no problem developing in the bottle over the next decade. Hold until after 2011.",,91,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Petite Sirah,Tres Sabores
70597,New Zealand,"Intriguingly floral and savory upfront, this delicate wine then adds a deep base of ripe cherries that expand effortlessly across the palate, giving an impression of fullness without weight, suppleness without being soft. Finishes long, with a great deal of complexity.",Waitaki Vineyard,91,55.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Valli
70598,Italy,"This is an intense and austere sparkling wine with persistent perlage and deep aromas of toast, roasted nut, honey, stone fruit and butterscotch. You'll also get a playful hint of chopped herbs that add buoyancy to the wine's thick, solid mouthfeel.",Brut Riserva,91,60.0,Northeastern Italy,Trento,,Sparkling Blend,Methius
70599,US,"Tastes young and jammy now, with perky, tartly sweet flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants. Oak adds smoky complexities that bring to mind mocha, vanilla and buttered toast, with a sprinkle of cinnamon. Somewhat lacking in nuance, with plenty of flash, this Cab should develop over the next 6–8 years.",Collector's Reserve Puerta Dorada Vineyard,91,120.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Martin Estate
70600,Italy,"Cheerful and bright, this luminous sparkler offers dried fruit aromas with yeast and baked bread tones as well. It has aged nicely over the past five years but maintain the freshness and crispness you look for in an Italian sparkling wine.",Satèn,91,47.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Chardonnay,Quadra
70601,Spain,"Round, stylish and wholesome on the nose, with wild berry, smoke, spice and not too much obvious oak. The palate is racy and forward, but also offers subtleties including dry fruit, spice, fresh tomato and wild herbs such as thyme and sage. Long and warm on the finish, with vanilla. Drink now through 2015.",Fincas de Ganuza Reserva,91,48.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Remírez de Ganuza
70602,France,"A highly perfumed wine, with enticing aromas. The palate is tougher, unforgiving, the young structure there to support fresh and concentrated fruit. There is a definite wood element, but it is not overdone. For aging 3–4 years.",Prestige,91,47.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Bellerose Figeac
70603,US,"The balance and brightness are immediately apparent, with sweet raspberry and red cherry fruit against some lightly earthy tannins. All in proportion, yet with a bit of extra depth that suggests some ageworthiness. Everything is ripe, but not too ripe, and the acidity feels natural and proportionate.",Corral Creek,91,44.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Chehalem
70604,France,"The dry, hard tannins are very Saint-Estèphe, but the wine bears its weight well, giving good black plum and berry fruits and a dense texture. It has a solid, chunky feel to it, dark and firm. The finish is more fresh and juicy.",,91,,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Meyney
70605,US,"A rich, polished Cabernet. Doesn't taste particularly Oakville-like, due to extreme ripeness, softness, high alcohol and refined tannins that could come from anywhere, but it's well crafted and delicious. Offers waves of blackberries, black currants, chocolate and cedar. Now–2013.",,91,60.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Coniglio
70606,US,"Powerful vanilla scents rise from the glass, but the fruit, even in this difficult vintage, comes out immediately. It's tart and sharp, with a strong herbal component, and the wine snaps into focus quickly with fruit, acid, tannin, herb and vanilla in equal proportion. Firm and tight, still quite young, this wine needs decanting and/or further bottle age to show its best.",Seven Springs Vineyard,91,45.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Evening Land
70607,US,"Still quite young yet unmistakably lush, this bottling immediately shows fresh apples, white peach and plenty of new oak from 100% barrel fermentation. The lip-smacking acidity keeps fruit and oak in balance; all that is needed is a bit more bottle age. Decant it if you plan to drink it immediately.",Caitlin's Reserve,91,40.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay,Adelsheim
70608,Spain,"Dense and heavy, and maybe a touch dull on the nose in terms of fruit aromas. But once it hits the palate the wine shines with intense black fruit, sugar beet and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and warm, with saturation and texture. Almost over the edge as far as ripeness, but not quite. Drink now through 2012.",Vendimia Seleccionada,91,59.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,García Figuero
70609,Spain,"Another impressive Oloroso from Gonzalez Byass. This is a sweet, dark, brooding Sherry with prune and other sweet fruit aromas. The palate is rich but has good flow, while dark flavors of dulce de leche and burnt brown sugar are wonderful. Sweet but balanced by mild coffee-like bitterness on the finish.",Solera 1847 Oloroso Dulce,91,18.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,González Byass
70610,Germany,"An expressive, extroverted style that still communicates a sense of place. There's loads of dried fruit character here, with apple, nectarine, rose and graham flour flavors that build to a long-lasting finish. Light-bodied, with a spice aftertaste. Drink now or hold five-plus years.",G Kabinett,91,29.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Johannishof
70611,New Zealand,"Gibbston is the coolest of Central Otago's subregions, and this wine reflects that in its delicate floral and herbal notes, even a touch of rhubarb. But there's also ample cherry fruit and a wonderfully lacy, silky texture. Long and crisp on the finish. Best from 2012–2018.",Gibbston Vineyard,91,55.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Valli
70612,US,"The vineyard name is a combination of the two prevalent soil types, Nekia and WillaKenzie. Along with sweet cherry fruit comes a defining minerality—a streak of iron running through the heart of the wine. Balanced nicely, with gentle acidity and sculpted tannins. In the finish you pick up an elegant streak of green tea.",Willakia Vineyard,91,35.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Soléna
70613,Italy,"This Brut expression from northern Italy boasts elegant aromas of honeysuckle, stone fruit, spice and crushed almonds. The wine is clean and smooth with creamy effervescence that sits tight over the palate.",Gran Cuvée Brut,91,,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,Bellavista
70614,US,"A welcome trend in Oregon is making Pinot Noir at moderate alcohol levels—here it's 13.5%. This enhances the wine's details, beginning with the aromas. Cola and clove, licorice and toffee scents promise a tasty bottle that turns out to be bursting with black berries, black cherries, black currant and even black tea flavors.",Estate,91,50.0,Oregon,Yamhill-Carlton District,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Anne Amie
70615,US,"Powerful scents mix dried herb, wet grass and petrol—it could be mistaken for Sauvignon Blanc in a blind tasting, and it has that much density and extract. The label says dry, and it is certainly that, much in the Australian style. Big, concentrated, high acid and quite cellarworthy.",Dry,91,20.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Riesling,Amity Vineyards
70616,Spain,"Serious, stately Rioja with key aromas of prune, blackberry and leather. Snappy enough on the palate, with plenty of pop as well as pure berry flavors, smooth tannins, zest and dry vanilla. Some might call it a bit acidic and traditional, but with food it'll do great. Drink now through 2016. Only 250 cases made.",El Belisario,91,80.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Agrícola Labastida
70617,Germany,"Serious and earthy, like walking into a wall of minerality. The fruit takes a back seat here, but is lusciously peachy and fresh while the long finish is sparked by hints of exotic spices. Give this two to three years to show its best.",Graacher Himmelreich Spätlese,91,,Mosel,,,Riesling,Joh. Jos. Prüm
70618,Italy,"Ca' del Bosco is one of Italy's best producers of sparkling wine and this Brut expression show the deft hands of the staff winemakers. The wine is bright and light, but elegant and enduring at the same time. You'll get honeysuckle, stone fruit and yellow roses.",Brut,91,,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,Ca' del Bosco
70619,Italy,Here's a sophisticated and spicy sparkling wine from the 2004 vintage that boasts a clean and tonic delivery across the palate. You could easily pair this silky wine with fish or white meat thanks to the incredibly smooth and soft impression it leaves.,Satèn,91,,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,Ca' del Bosco
70620,Chile,"Yellow Delicious apple and melon aromas start it off in a fruity direction, and the palate shows peach and pear flavors. With no oak, there's no butter, toast or resin to speak of. There is, however, a sugary almost Riesling-esque quality to the wine. All in all, it's unconventional but pretty good, with a nice bolt of acidity keeping it wide awake. Imported by T. Edward Wines.",Unwooded,85,9.0,Molina,,,Chardonnay,Echeverria
70621,Spain,"Fine aromas that announce balance and completeness draw you in, and right away you will like the cherry, red currant and cassis flavors. But as that fruit sits and the acidity builds, the wine goes racy initially and then almost haywire. By the end it almost falls off toward sour. Best right out of the bottle, and with food.",Crianza,85,14.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Castillo Labastida
70622,US,"This is typical of the appellation, a soft, gentle wine, with polished berry-cherry flavors. It's also dry, balanced and modest in alcohol, at a good price.",,85,10.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Castle Rock
70623,US,"Its exceptional dryness and searing acidity make this wine a natural to drink as an apéritif or with a wide range of food. It doesn't particularly taste like Riesling, though, more like a citrusy, minerally Albariño or Pinot Grigio.",,85,17.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Riesling,Banyan
70624,Spain,"As per usual, this wine carries a leafiness and peppery quality that runs ahead of its fruit quotient. That doesn't mean it's a poor wine; but it emphasizes dry oak and saucy flavors as opposed to richness and ripeness. Best for Rioja traditionalists and those who might drink it with robust foods.",Finca Monasterio,85,43.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Baron De Ley
70625,Australia,"A bit on the lean side, and with some drying tannins on the finish, this is one wine in the Philip Shaw lineup that's less than impressive. Cola and earth notes overshadow the black cherry fruit, and there's a slight menthol edge to the flavors.",No. 8,85,40.0,New South Wales,Orange,,Pinot Noir,Philip Shaw
70626,US,"As always, a nice, easy-drinking Chard with plenty of Central Coast character. The cool, long hangtime has given very ripe fruit, while preserving vital acidity. The winemaker brings a deft touch of oak.",,85,17.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Wild Horse
70627,US,"Easy and tasty, this is a nice everyday wine, with citrus, vanilla and grass flavors, a tangy bite of acid, and a dry, lemon-and-lime finish.",,85,15.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Simi
70628,US,"If you like your Zins very soft and melted, with gentle cherry and raspberry tart flavors, including the baked, buttery pie crusts, you'll love this one. It's way too soft for aging, so drink now.",Grandmere,85,35.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Renwood
70629,US,"A good value for dryness and balance, and lots of tasty flavors. Blackberries, currants, cherries, milk chocolate, spice and smoky oak finish with a touch of tannins, suggesting pork or lamb.",,85,10.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Syrah,Renwood
70630,US,"Good everyday Zin, a little green, but rich enough in raspberry and cherry flavors with a hit of spice. The dryness and moderate alcohol win extra points.",Private Selection,85,11.0,California,California,California Other,Zinfandel,Robert Mondavi
70631,Chile,"If you can handle the large-quantity characteristics that govern this wine, particularly olive, herbal notes and vegetal aromas and flavors, then it's pretty nice. For those opposed to traditional Bordeaux-style green notes, it's probably better to upgrade to Santa Rita's richer, riper Medalla Real. Good on the whole but not great; yet at 150,000 cases it's hard to expect better.",Reserva,85,11.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Rita

70634,US,"There are so many good qualities to this wine that I wish it were more concentrated. With a very high production, the vines must have been stretched. Too bad, because it shows gorgeous structure of acids and tannins, the kind of Cabernet only Napa Valley can produce. Still, it rewards for elegance and modest blackberry and oak flavors.",,85,26.0,California,Yountville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Charles Krug
70635,US,"The words “country style” apply perfectly to this Rhône blend based on Mourvèdre. It's soft and simple and dry, with pleasant cherry, blackberry and Kahlua flavors.",Couer du Terroir Rouge,85,30.0,California,El Dorado,Sierra Foothills,Rhône-style Red Blend,David Girard
70636,Chile,"A rewarding mix of sweet red fruits and earthy chocolate is what this Syrah-Cabernet blend holds in store. The nose deals cola and coffee with some syrupy berry aromas, while the palate is grabby and a touch rough but also endowed with a ripe, forward fruit character.",,85,8.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Syrah-Cabernet,Estampa
70637,US,"From Calaveras County, this wine shows the ripeness and rusticity of the region. Insistent in blackberries, black currants and chocolate-covered cherries, it shows earthier layers of thyme and pepper, with edgy, slightly green tannins and a bitter finish. Drink now.",Reserve,85,25.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ironstone
70638,US,"The vineyard has been the source of great Syrah, and while this is a good wine, it's not without flaws. Brilliantly ripe in black currants, cherries, cassis, chocolate, sweet leather and spices, it's dry and finely structured. But there's a scour of acid that disturbs its equilibrium.",Paraiso Vineyard,85,35.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Syrah,Manzoni
70639,France,"Quite funky indeed. Saturated with spice such as anise, clove and rotting apples on the orchard floor, the earthy, full-bodied and slightly viscous nature of this beast is overwhelming. We're not quite sure if this one warrants the hefty price tag attached to it.",Le Château Kastelberg Grand Cru,85,77.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Marc Kreydenweiss
70640,US,"Shows the gentle, silky mouthfeel you want in a nice Pinot, and also the variety's array of cherries, cola, tea, cocoa and spice flavors. Feels soft and rustic in the mouth, though.",,85,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Pinot Noir,Judd's Hill
70641,US,"A fine everyday wine. With its soft, velvety mouthfeel and luscious fruit, it's a good buy. The blackberry, cassis, plum, coffee, tobacco, leather and cocoa flavors are a little thin, but they finish dry and clean, with a scour of tannins.",,85,10.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Petite Sirah,Jewel
70642,France,"From the top Monts Damnés vineyard, this crisp light wine has yeasty flavors that hide the fresh grapefruit flavors. There is pleasant acidity at the back, along with some green apple skin. Will be ready by the beginning of 2008.",La Croix de Perthuis,85,24.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Paul Prieur et Fils
70643,Spain,"Aromas of cherry sucking candy, sangria and citrus peel are easy and clean but not what you'd call sophisticated. The palate is forward and basic, with tangy cherry and plum skin flavors. It thickens a bit on the finish but always has a racy personality. Better with food due to grabby tannins and acids.",Reserva,85,25.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Ramón Bilbao
70644,US,"Way too soft and ripe, and although it's technically dry, this tastes like a concoction of chocolate mousse, crème de cassis and cinnamon. Luscious, but it isn't really a dry table wine.",Aubaine Vineyards,85,40.0,California,San Luis Obispo County,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Stephen Ross
70645,Chile,"Dark and dense, but also a touch warm and soupy. Air allows it to unfold and show boysenberry and plum flavors, while the feel is creamy, syrupy and flush. Overall it's tasty enough and reasonably well made, although there are some herbal flavors that rise up on the midpalate and finish. A big-production wine at 45,000 cases.",,85,12.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Ema
70646,US,"Fancy name for a fairly simple wine. Crisp and fruity, it has slightly sweet citrus, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors, with polished acidity for balance.",Veauta Ranch Vineyard Clos Rene,85,25.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Viognier,Renwood
70647,US,"Soft, simple and gentle, with sugary cherry pie and cola flavors. The silky texture and light mouthfeel are wonderful, but the wine would be far better if it finished drier and crisper.",Estate Grown,85,36.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Robert Stemmler
70648,Spain,"Seems like Solabal let its reserva-level grapes get a little too soft before picking. The wine has color and potential, but the nose is a little flat and syrupy. The palate delivers ripe dark fruit flavors but also a touch of medicinality. Balance can be fleeting and this wine doesn't have it all the way.",Reserva,85,23.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Solabal
70649,US,"Off-dry, this has solid flavors suggesting cracker and grain, honey and melon. It's a flavorful, sturdy take on Riesling, but does not have the pretty floral character.",,85,14.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Riesling,San Juan Vineyards
70650,US,"Not an ager, but lovely and vibrant now. With crisp acidity and an elegantly sleek mouthfeel, it offers ripe flavors of cherries, raspberries, pomegranates and cola, enriched with smoky oak. Gets better as it warms in the glass.",Poinsett Hayley Vineyard,91,45.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Calicaro
70651,Spain,"A smooth and coaxing Sherry with almond and dried fruit aromas that lead perfectly to toffee and almond flavors. There's more dryness than fruit here, with peanut brittle accents and then a long, smoky finish that doesn't lose focus. Graceful Oloroso, with a nice individual character.",Cristina Oloroso Abacado,91,18.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,González Byass
70652,US,"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this is a good, smooth wine that shows its Napa origins in the ripeness of fruit and classy tannins. Floods the mouth with blackberries and oak. There's a certain sharpness that cuts through the richness and lasts through the finish, which may limit ageability, so drink soon.",Trilogy,91,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Flora Springs
70653,France,"A richly perfumed wine, with delicious flavors of raisins, dried plums and sweet tannins. It is an opulent wine, the acidity keeping a watchful eye over the ripeness. It is ready to drink now.",,91,25.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Andron Blanquet
70654,New Zealand,"This is a medium-dry Riesling with plenty of weight and richness, but also wonderfully perfumed aromatics of citrus blossom. Lime and green apple fruit carries the palate, and finishes long, with an almost tactile sense of minerality.",,91,21.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Spy Valley
70655,Germany,"The ‘goldkap,' or ‘gold capsule,' in this wine's designation indicates a riper cuvée than the producer's ordinary spätlese. As expected, the fruit is exuberant and lush with hints of tinned apricots and peach jam. An underlying note of lemon zest enlivens the palate and carries over to the long, flowery finish. There's lots of sweetness here; consider serving on its own.",Hallgartener Jongfer Spätlese Goldkap,91,43.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Prinz
70656,US,"As with most of Oregon's 2006 Pinots, this shows more grip and fullness than the winery's '07. There's a strong smoky character, presumably from barrel toast, and a thick and chewy midpalate of mixed berries and tart cherry fruit. The acids stick out a bit, but the dominant flavor is cherry, with a spicy herbal edge.",Evenstad Reserve,90,58.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Domaine Serene
70657,New Zealand,"Dry River's 2008 Pinot Gris is a lush, creamy-textured off-dry wine that pairs bold fruit elements of pear and melon with hints of peach leaf and gingery spice. Long on the finish, with absolutely no trace of bitterness. Drink now–2015.",,90,55.0,Martinborough,,,Pinot Gris,Dry River
70658,France,"A smooth wine that softens well, but that still retains rich fruits and dense, dusty tannins. There is good power here, from blackberry and red plums, the texture of velour. Drink now and over the next 3–4 years.",,90,20.0,Bordeaux,Haut-Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Lamothe-Cissac

The structure is open, rounded, lit lightly by acidity, sustained by a base of dry tannins and finishing with light perfume.",,90,,Bordeaux,Lalande de Pomerol,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Siaurac
70661,US,"A beautifully balanced, elegant Pinot Noir from a great appellation that's ready to drink now. It's dry and firm in acidity, with complex flavors of cherries and raspberries, although to overemphasize the fruit gives the wrong impression. Also prominent are minerals, flowers and herbs.",,90,40.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Demetria
70662,US,"One of the more interesting Cabs to emerge lately from the Foothills. Shows real class, with ripe flavors of blackberries and black currants, and fine, smooth, complex tannins. Could develop for 3–5 years.",,90,40.0,California,El Dorado,Sierra Foothills,Cabernet Sauvignon,Diamond Springs Vineyard
70663,Italy,"Harmony and balance are apparent in this elegant, sophisticated sparkling wine from 100% Chardonnay. The wine's aromas include apricot, stone fruit, yellow rose and toasted nut.

70664,New Zealand,"Felton Road's nondesignated Pinot boasts complex aromas of coffee, beetroot, vanilla, cinnamon, cherries and fresh herbs, delivered by a firmly structured, rather muscular Pinot Noir that appears to need a couple of years to settle down. Try it from 2011–2018.",,90,55.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Felton Road
70665,Italy,"This pretty sparkling wine shows many of the characteristics associated with northern Italy: the wine is crisp, fresh and the aromas are brilliantly intact.

70666,US,"Tasted alongside the winemaker's 2006 from the same fruit, this shows both vintage variation and consistent terroir—the marks of a real professional. The complexity and vitality of the wine remain comparable to the riper 2006. Tart fruits, leaf, herb and streaks of earth make for a lively, interesting palate-pleaser.",Basalt Block,90,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Brittan Vineyards
70667,Spain,"This is nothing more than a few barrels of wine bottled by Hughes, a so-called “global vintner.” And like its Lot 128 brother, it is really good juice. Inky and floral, with blueberry and wild raspberry flavors. It's smooth, fresh, bold and finishes with mint and chocolate. Shows the positives of Campo de Borja's Garnacha.",Lot 129,90,15.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Garnacha,Cameron Hughes
70668,US,"A fruity Pinot Noir, with delicious flavors of raspberry tart, Cocoa Puffs and vanilla cream.

70671,Italy,"Here's a sophisticated wine from Franciacorta near Brescia in Northern Italy.

Here you get aromas of sourdough, apricot and dried fruit.",Brut Millesimato,90,40.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,Lantieri de Paratico
70672,New Zealand,"With only 6.5 g/l of residual sugar, this weighty wine comes across as almost dry, allowing the emphasis to be on the bold notes of melon, pear and citrus.

70673,US,"Here's a balanced, young Cab-based Bordeaux blend. It's juicy in tutti-frutti Lifesaver candy flavors of blackberries, cherries and raspberries, yet is quite dry, and the acid-tannin structure gives it an elegant framework. Seems best now for its youthful pizzazz.",Bradford Estate,90,44.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Meritage,Sawyer
70674,New Zealand,The lifted nose of herbs and tea gives an extra shot of complexity to this concentrated wine. Intense cherry and cassis fruit ends in a long finish that blends drying tannins with mouthwatering acids. Best from 2014–2020.,Reserve,90,,Hawke's Bay,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Villa Maria
70675,US,"This is the bottle you want on your table if the night is calling for burgers, flank steak, tri-tip, Mexican, Southwest—in other words, food that is hearty, spicy and satisfying. The 2007 blend included old vine Zin, Resonance Pinot Noir, Baby Poux Cabernet and more. Peter Rosback isn't saying what's in this 2008, but you won't care once you slug down the first glass. It's just pure deliciousness, cherries and chocolate galore.",Red Table Wine,90,16.0,Oregon,Oregon,Oregon Other,Red Blend,Sineann
70676,Spain,"Dry and smooth, with balsam and cedar aromas wrapped around controlled fruit scents and toast.

70680,Chile,"TerraNoble certainly hits you with some major oak character, but still the wine works in its price range.

Shows spice and a hint of green on the finish.",Vineyard Selection,85,8.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,TerraNoble
70681,US,"Ripeness was no problem in this fruit-forward wine. It's exuberant in cherries, blackberries, plums and cranberries, with a little dusting of oak, and the finish is totally dry. Gives some real upscale Cab experience, at a decent price.",Private Selection,85,11.0,California,California,California Other,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Mondavi
70682,US,"Here's a nice, easy wine that rewards for upfront pineapple, green apple, apricot and spice flavors.

70689,Spain,"A standard but solid Tempranillo is what you're looking at. The nose pushes red fruit and some American oak aromas like pickle and dill. The feel is fresh and young, but also a little fleshy and substantive. Finishes friendly and smooth.",,85,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Darien

70691,US,"Zesty flavors and aromas of pineapple and orange are balanced with a honeyed sweetness that makes this a fun and unique apéritif or a tasty accompaniment to ethnic, spicy cuisine.

Nice for an apéritif quaffer.",Cole Ranch,85,16.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Riesling,Blackstone
70693,Chile,"It takes a while for the oak and leather elements to lessen on the nose, and by then the wine has taken on a meaty, reserved, mildly burnt character. It's a woody number with some complexity, namely bitter chocolate that envelops the back palate and finish. Throughout it shows size and intent but never does it fully pull it off. 550 cases made.",Bayo Oscuro,85,28.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Syrah,Kingston Family
70694,Chile,"This Spanish producer's Chilean label relies on Cabernet and Carmenère for this blend, and it's a little vegetal and murky at first. Airing frees oak and creamy red-fruit flavors, while the chocolaty finish is of medium length.",Küme,85,15.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Red Blend,Guelbenzu
70695,Australia,"Starts with scents of lime sherbet, but also hints of herbs, kerosene and stone fruits. Citrus and underripe peaches are the main flavors.

70696,Spain,"Perfectly nice, but ultimately basic in its approach. The nose is initally dry and woodsy, with plenty of balsam.

70697,Chile,"If it weren't for the slight lettuce-like aromas and flavors that snake through the wine's nose and palate, this would be ideal. And even with those hints of green it has good red fruit and vanilla flavors backed by chewy tannins.",Special Reserve,85,10.0,Maule Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Simone
70698,US,"Lots to admire in this lush Pinot, but also a major flaw. The flavors are deliciously upfront, all cherry pie, blackberry tart, blueberry, milk chocolate, gingerbread, caramel, vanilla and toast. But flavor isn't everything. The wine needs structure, more acidity, more tannins, something for the palate to grab on to.",Stone Corral Vineyard,85,48.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Stephen Ross
70699,US,"From Luna Vineyards, better known for reds, which is perhaps why the front label says only Freakout, comes this interesting Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Tocai Friulano blend.

70700,US,"This is a good example of Long Island Riesling from a producer who has a true historic stake in the region. Crisp, lively flavors of apple and melon mingled with a refreshing touch of minerality are light but substantial, and the finish is long and full of fruit flavors.

70703,Spain,The kick and acidic foundation of this crianza work in its favor. They balance some of the heavier elements and emphasize the berry core and also the finish. Is it narrow and limited? Yes. But it fits the traditional mold and doesn't disappoint.,Crianza,85,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,El Coto

70706,US,"This is one of those wines where the aroma and flavor disconnect. Smells great, with inviting Pinotesque scents of ripe raspberries, cherries, root beer, vanilla, cinnamon and smoky oak.

70708,Spain,"Spicy and reedy in an old-fashioned way. This wine represents traditional Riojano winemaking: it's tight, acidic and endowed with racy rhubarb, raspberry and dill flavors.

70715,Spain,"A touch horsey at first, but with time it settles on saddle leather and earthy fruit. The palate is chunky and beefy, with some funk, chocolate and herbal black fruit.

70729,US,"The grapes are from the newish region just west of Petaluma, a chilly, windy area. The climate shows in the brisk acidity, while the excellence of the vintage gives savory flavors of cherries, anise and cola. Oak adds a fine touch of toast. Drink now–2013.",,90,42.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Morris Ranch
70730,Spain,"Bold, dark and handsome, albeit a touch herbal and earthy on the nose. The palate is thick and statuesque, with herbal, rooty berry fruit, a spot of raisin, and cracked black pepper. Chewy, deep and ultimately dry on the finish. Drinkable now; best in another couple of years.",Gran Reserva,90,53.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
70731,Germany,"Aromatic, succulent and invigorating, this Riesling is firing on all cylinders. The palate is on the dry side with powerful flavors of honey, ginger and peach that fade to an enticing spice note.",Rüdesheim Berg Rottland Erstes Gewächs,90,65.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Johannishof
70732,France,"A full, liquorous wine, with ripe mango and apricot flavors set against a backdrop of honey, dry botrytis and dense texture. The wine is now ready and maturing well. Drink over the next year.",Thomas Barton Réserve,90,,Bordeaux,Sauternes,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Barton & Guestier
70733,Italy,"This is a beautiful sparkling wine with well-integrated aromas of citrus, stone fruit and toasted bread. The wine is luminous and soft with foamy perlage and elegant smoothness in the mouth. Its fruit flavors endure many long minutes.",Cuvée Brut,90,,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,Bellavista
70734,France,"The wood element is powerful here, giving a smooth, polished character to the otherwise tightly knit fruit. Flavors of bitter coffee, spice and barbecued meats are there, with the juicy acidity and a dense texture. The wine needs another year to come together.",Château la Tempérance,90,20.0,Bordeaux,Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Bernard Magrez
70735,France,"A fascinating—and unusual—blend of Sauvignon Gris and Sémillon, this wine is full of ripe, seriously opulent fruit, with peach and mango dominant. It is fleshed out with intense perfumes, rich fruit skins and kiwi fruit freshness.",Château Haut Mouleyre,90,15.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Blanc,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Bernard Magrez
70736,France,"From 2009, Labégorce-Zédé will no longer exist, being amalgamated with Château Labégorce-Margaux. So this 2007 is one of the last vintages. The wine has solid but lively black fruits, the tannins dark, firm and full of blackberry juice flavors with a touch of cranberry dryness. It is definitely for aging.",,90,,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Labegorce Zédé
70737,France,"That it was possible to soften the somewhat aggressive tannins of 2007 is shown in this smooth, rich wine. It is certainly a wine for early drinking, but it has ripe berry fruit and fresh acidity, with well-judged tannins.",,90,,Bordeaux,Moulis-en-Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Poujeaux
70738,US,"Nice cherry fruit right up front brings some sweetness to this wine. Young as it is, the components are still knitting together, but there is much to enjoy already. Lovely grapey/cherry flavors are wrapped in light herb, and accented with almost salty sea flavors.",Wind Ridge,90,32.0,Oregon,Ribbon Ridge,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Chehalem
70739,France,"A fine, totally sweet-fruited burst of Merlot that brings together fine structure with the beginnings of mature texture. There is a layer of vanilla, a warmly polished feel with glowing berries and sweet spice. Delicious and certainly ready to drink.",P du Roy,90,,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,D & R Dubois
70740,Spain,"CUNE is a throwback bodega whose wines won't appeal to followers of the new wave. And since I consider myself a backer of the modern style, I found this wine too obtuse, funky and borderline dirty to rate higher. It's full of mossy, stewy flavors and the feel is heavy. Traditionalist, however, may find it worthy of greater praise.",Imperial Gran Reserva,84,60.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,CVNE
70741,Chile,"In this case “reserva” equals heavily oaked, and the nose exhibits a bit too much toast and popcorn.

Finishes slightly grabby, with some peach flavor and a hint of resin.",Reserva,84,9.0,Maule Valley,,,Chardonnay,Chilcas

70743,Spain,"This wine is not up there with the bodega's top bottlings. It's rather sweet and soft, with mildly green and minty aromas. In the mouth, there's size and power but also a strong medicinal overtone that dampens the fiesta. In the end it's big and fruity but there's no sense of path or purpose.",Crianza,84,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Consejo de la Alta

70750,Romania,"Light, lively and with appealing flavors and aromas of flowers, citrus and apple, this semi-sweet wine from Romania is great as an after-dinner treat or paired with cheese.

Imported by Vidalco International, LLC.",Riesling Italico Demi-Dulce,84,12.0,Vânju Mare,,,Riesling,Bonvino
70751,US,"A little overripe, with some stewed cherry and raisin flavors and richer notes of chocolate and vanilla.

Contains some Cabernet, Syrah, Sangiovese, Merlot and Petite Sirah.",Panorama,84,18.0,California,California,California Other,Zinfandel,Magito
70752,US,"There's a lot of sugary sweetness in this wine, which tastes like the blackberry and cherry filling of those pop-up tarts. Fortunately, it has the acidity and tannic richness to balance. But it's not really a table wine. More like dessert.",Carreras Ranch,84,36.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Manzanita Creek
70753,US,"O.K. Chard, but pretty thin, especially for this prestige appellation. The plaster of oak is too strong for the fruit. The flavors are of lemon candy and oak.",Lucia Highland Vineyard,84,28.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Manzoni

70755,Chile,"Chill it and kill it, and you probably won't be disappointed. There isn't a lot of character to the nose, but the palate offers round melon and citrus flavors supported by pretty good acidity. It's a little sugary but sound and tropical. More than 200,000 cases produced, so it should be widely available.",120,84,8.0,Lontué Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Santa Rita
70756,Chile,"Fairly intense celery, asparagus and capsicum-based aromas could be described as vegetal or just green; you be the judge.

70757,Spain,"Vanilla, raisin and carob aromas announce a level of heft and overripeneness that is never lost or compensated for. It's a jammy, soft, well-aged specimen that doesn't have much life or kick. It does offer ripe, sweet berry flavors, however, and some molasses.",Gran Reserva,84,38.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Ramón Bilbao

70760,Chile,"The bouquet blends barnyard and black currants, so in that way it's classic and pretty good. The palate, however, is tangy, short and more “red” in style than the nose leads you to expect. Good freshness and aromas but maybe more tangy and tight than Chilean Syrah should be.",Reserva,84,9.0,Rapel Valley,,,Syrah,Chilcas
70761,Chile,"Apple and even some hazelnut create a sweet nose, then comes a soda-like palate that houses lime and orange flavors.

70762,Spain,"Raisin, licorice and sawdust are the primary aromas, while the palate runs dry and slightly overdone with oak.

70763,Chile,"From the Nido de Aguila winery, this is a non-vintage blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah that weighs in light and herbal. The nose is kind of saucy and sulfuric, and the palate is lean and racy. Flavorwise, it's more or less harmonious but nondescript, with light but short vanilla shadings on the finish.",,84,11.0,Maipo Valley,,,Red Blend,Valentino
70764,Chile,"Soft and simple on the nose, with bulk. Size more than substance seems to be the theme here. The palate is a wide load of apple cider and nondescript citrus, while the back end and finish are chunky and lose focus as they rumble along. A forward wine but what's it really aiming to be?",Rio Azul,84,15.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Chilcas
70765,Australia,"There's a light salmon hue to this wine, but along with that lovely color has come some slightly bitter notes from skin contact.

70769,France,"Floral notes of rose hips and hibiscus dominate this wine along with essences of petrol and white gumdrop.

70772,US,"This is one of the best buys on the market now for a Cabernet of this quality at this price.

70774,US,"The scents explode with both dark fruit and dark chocolate, and flavors follow, all wrapped in stiff tannins. A serious effort, this spent 18 months in French oak.

70775,US,"Eric Hamacher has done a fine job with this wine. At 13.6% alcohol it is in fine balance, with a precise mix of strawberry, pie cherry, root beer and herb flavors.

70819,Chile,"Disjointed in many ways, but there's also some genuine intent to this wine. The nose is fairly true to the varietal: it delivers tropical fruit plus salad greens. But the palate is wavy, glossy and too tangy with citrus. The wine seems to be grasping for a guide map but to no avail.",Single Vineyard Visión,84,14.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Cono Sur
70820,US,"The '04 Reserve Cab Franc was a very good wine. This one is much different, rustic and simple, with stewed cherry flavors and a bitter finish. Okay for everyday fare.",,84,10.0,California,California,California Other,Cabernet Franc,Ironstone
70821,Chile,"A little grapy and heavy, but overall this purple-colored Syrah is good. The bouquet is sweet with plum and prune, and the palate, while a little tangy and young, has vibrant if generic plum and berry flavors. Best if youthful, fruity New World reds are your thing.",Reserve,84,10.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Syrah,Gracia de Chile
70822,US,"Decent everyday quality, but too hot and raw, although there's plenty of savory cherry fruit. The alcohol is a relatively modest 14.5%, but the wine leaves a burn on the finish.",Le Vigne di San Domenico,84,23.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Franc,Sylvester
70823,US,"From down in Paso comes this soft, chocolaty Merlot. Acidity is deficient, but this kind of flavor goes a long way to saving the wine, which has the taste of perfectly ripe, crushed blackberries.",Kiara Private Reserve,84,15.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Merlot,Sylvester
70824,Chile,"Less dark than most, which indicates that the wine is well into its aging process. On the nose, you'll find buttery dill aromas, while on the palate there's some leafy berry, tomato and cola flavors. Decent but unspectacular, and it seems as though it's beginning to fade away.",1865 Reserva,84,18.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,San Pedro
70825,US,"There are some interesting things here, and also some problems. On the plus side is a dry, silky mouthfeel and a persistence of cherries into the finish. But this Pinot is overly soft, and those cherries are kind of one-dimensional.",,84,28.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Acacia
70826,US,"Too much acidity in this dry, fruity Pinot. Pale in color, it shows silky tannins and nice cherry, cola and spicy oak flavors, but that minty sharpness is awkward.",Galante Vineyard,84,35.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Harrington
70827,US,"With its playful balance of sweetness and acid, and its enticing aroma of apples and honey, this offers a pretty, easy-going wine experience. Paired with a chicken salad or a plate of spicy Asian fare, the wine is a great choice and the price is right. Its minerality gives it food-pairing flexibility, so experiment.",,84,12.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards
70828,US,"Very soft, almost melted is the texture on this wine. Soft in both tannins and acids, which leaves the fruit and alcohol to star. The flavors, of blackberries, cherries, milk chocolate, plums and coffee, are rich, but the wine could use greater structure.",Lot 24,84,12.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Cameron Hughes
70829,France,"Vegetal notes and flinty chalk dominate the nose, while essences of green apple and lemon struggle to overcome the intrinsic greenness. The short finish gives no justice to the lush, creamy texture.",Kirchberg Grand Cru,84,16.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Domaine Klipfel
70830,New Zealand,"A super value in Pinot Noir, just so long as you don't expect a bright, berry-scented wine. This is a dark, mysteriously earthy and herbal Pinot, with savory, spicy elements backed by dark fruit and a long, dusty finish. Drink it now and over the next few years.",Estate,90,20.0,Martinborough,,,Pinot Noir,Te Kairanga
70831,South Africa,"Aromas of black currant, violet and pepper start this stylish Cabernet and Petit Verdot red from Warwick. On the palate, smooth, round and full-bodied flavors of vanilla, black cherry and cassis are complex but easy drinking. A delicious, chewy spice finish ends the sip. Pair with hearty cuisine like steaks, stews and roasted lamb.",The First Lady,90,15.0,Western Cape,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Warwick
70832,Spain,"When in doubt, you can always trust Dry Sack. As always, this is a powerful, rich Sherry with burnt sugar and heavily toasted coffee and caramel flavors. It's no softie courtesy of heat and acidity, and at all points it mixes its sweet side with tough, roasted intensity. Great for cigar smokers.",Drysack Solera Especial Sweet Old Olorosso Aged 15 Years,90,25.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,Williams & Humbert
70833,US,"A beautifully elegant, refined Chardonnay. Because it's not overloaded with oak, it displays the basic finesse of the grapes from this cool-climate vineyard. Crisp and dry, it's rich and complex in citrus, tropical fruit, peach, mineral and honeysuckle flavors, at a fair price.",,90,20.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Artesa
70834,US,"A fine-tuned, fragrant, low (13%) alcohol Pinot Noir, this wine offers fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, fresh and juicy, but with a steely spine and enough tannin to feel sturdy and cellarworthy. There is more than a trace of leaf and herb in the finish.",,90,36.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,J.K. Carrière
70835,Australia,"A few years of age have turned this South Australia Chardonnay into a highly nuanced tipple. Kerosene, hay and coconut aromas play off fragrant blood orange scents while the palate offers up toast and caramel in a tight, well-defined structure. Try with grilled salmon or serve on its own. Drinking at its peak now but will last a few more years.",Reeves Point,90,28.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Chardonnay,Jacob's Creek
70836,US,"A nice example of the '08 Pinots, just coming out, and the price is fair for a wine of this quality. Dry and silky, it shows good varietal flavors of cherries, cola, chocolate, sweet pomegranates and smoky oak, with a long, rich finish. Drink now.",Estate Bottled,90,25.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hook & Ladder
70837,US,"Dark, dry and tannic, this is one of the best Petit Verdots out there. It's full bodied and powerful in pure, concentrated blackberries and black currants, with a touch of violets and cedar. Now–2013.",Tephra Ridge Vineyard,90,40.0,California,Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Petite Verdot,Langtry
70838,Germany,"Very impressive, with a mineral backdrop setting the stage for a powerful expression of apricot and pear fruit. The mouthwatering acidity masks a fair amount of residual sugar, resulting in a lingering finish that seems dry. Drink now or hold for several years for a more nuanced expression.",V Kabinett,90,23.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Johannishof
70839,US,"The Savoya Pinot Noir displays excellent concentration and grip and its raspberry/cherry fruit gives it a tart, racy flair. There's an herbal edge to the tannins, but overall this is very well crafted, balanced and built for medium-term cellaring.",Savoya Vineyard,90,50.0,Oregon,Yamhill-Carlton District,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Ken Wright
70840,Italy,"This is one of the nicest and most satisfying expressions of Prosecco Cartizze on the market today.

70841,US,"This is quite a good Pinot Noir, although despite the tannin-acid tightness it's not likely to improve beyond 2011. It's dry and silky and delicious in cherry, cola, spice and sandalwood flavors, and there's even a touch of chocolate.",Estate Grown,90,65.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Donum
70842,Germany,"Give this wine some air before you serve it in order to appreciate the entire range of its dense aromatics, which flow from delicate tangerine, to peach and on into the mineral end of the spectrum. The palate is juicy, with an energizing tension between the nervy acidity and delicate sweetness. Finishes long, with a slate undertow. Try with cod in a miso sauce.",Bernkasteler Lay Kabinett,90,25.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Dr. Loosen
70843,New Zealand,"This vintage of Dry River's Gewürz is almost tropical in style, with mango and pineapple elements accented by gingery spice and a dash of white pepper. It's off dry in style, with plenty of body without being at all blowsy. Drink it over the next few years.",Lovat Vineyard,90,45.0,Martinborough,,,Gewürztraminer,Dry River
70844,France,"A generous wine, but one with good backbone and structure. The black fruits are beginning to meld into the sweet tannins and flavors of black cherry compote and spices. It is approaching maturity, but could age another 2–3 years.",Arthus,90,,Bordeaux,Côtes de Castillon,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,D & R Dubois
70845,US,"This is fermented in neutral barrels, so it is a rounder, more open style than Pinot Gris done in stainless steel. It is therefore more approachable at a young age, and also tastes leesy and creamy—a treat for the palate. The fruit is lean and fresh, and a bracing minerality infuses the finish.",Reserve,90,24.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris,Chehalem
70846,New Zealand,"Part of Pernod Ricard New Zealand, Church Road is a historic property dating back to the end of the 19th century, so it is a shame that the wines are not available in the U.S. The 2007 Reserve Cabernet Merlot features delicate scents of dried herbs and tea leaves allied to bold cassis and cherry fruit. It's firm and slightly drying on the finish; give it until 2015 to come into its own.",Reserve,90,,Hawke's Bay,,,Cabernet Merlot,Church Road
70847,France,"A densely textured wine, but one with the weight of fruit to sustain the dry core. It is sold, chunky, pulling black berry fruits and plum skins into a good mélange of flavors. It will soften, but will always remain on the firm side. Age for 3–4 years.",,90,30.0,Bordeaux,Haut-Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Coufran

70849,Italy,"Tight and compact with pristine aromas of peach, citrus and sourdough, this vibrant sparkling Brut would pair with shellfish and oysters. There are linear mineral notes at the back but the wine is fresh and tart in the mouth.",Brut,90,33.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,Contadi Castaldi
70850,US,"Very aromatic, with an elusive note of violets that adds to the attractions of the blackberries, briary wild cherries, licorice and black pepper. Full bodied and dry, this Zin is charmingly sweet in fruit and brown butter on the finish.",Herbert Vineyard,90,24.0,California,El Dorado,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Miraflores
70851,US,"Blackberry and black cherry flavors are right up front, the fruit is definitely the star here. Light suggestions of dried leaf and moist earth add complexity, though in this lighter vintage it does not have the power of previous bottlings. This is a graceful, perfectly balanced wine, whose subtle pleasures will reward those who pay close attention.",Domaine Danielle Laurent,90,45.0,Oregon,Yamhill-Carlton District,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Soléna
70852,South Africa,"Named after a popular Afrikaner country dance, “straight arm,” this Pinotage, Touriga Nacional, Tannat, Grenache, Cabernet Sauvignon and Primitivo blend marries classic European flavors with South African spice. The nose offers blackberry, plum, cherry and pepper, and on the palate, like flavors are delivered in a structured, clean package that ends with a nutty, spicy spin.",Solms Astor Langarm,90,20.0,Western Cape,,,Red Blend,Solms-Delta
70853,Spain,"Excellent Ribera crianza here. It has a smooth, appealing bouquet of candied berry fruit, which is followed by a rich palate of cassis, black cherry, prune, chocolate and coffee. For the price point this is right on the money; it's ripe but also really good and ready to drink.",Crianza,90,16.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
70854,France,"Made at the Sauternes classed growth Château Guiraud, this is part of a worldwide range of wines under the Oriel brand.

70855,France,"A charmer. A soft, perfumed wine, light but well balanced. The berry fruits are just hinting at the start of maturity. The wine, though, has great freshness and delicious acidity, with the tannins now rounding out.",,89,,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Coutet
70856,New Zealand,"NZ Syrahs are often called Rhône-like, but while this one does show some lovely floral and hickory-smoke nuances, it also comes across as slightly raisiny or jammy, with cassis notes that even lean toward being chocolaty. Whatever you think of the aromas and flavors, it's a richly concentrated, velvety textured wine with plenty to recommend it.",Lovat Vineyard Amaranth,89,75.0,Martinborough,,,Syrah,Dry River
70857,New Zealand,"Roughly half Cabernet Sauvignon, one-fourth Cab Franc and the rest a blend of Merlot and Malbec, the 2007 Old Olive Block shows crisp plum fruit with chocolate and cedar overtones.

70858,France,"Good firm tannins, with ripe blackberry jam flavors, are followed by some spice from wood. This is a well-structured wine, its elements in place.

70861,US,"With 2.8% residual sugar, this frankly sweet white is a little soft. The lack of acidity makes the jammy apricot, pineapple and honeysuckle flavors finish a little flat.",Estate White,84,16.0,California,Mendocino Ridge,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Riesling,Greenwood Ridge

70863,US,"Decent everyday Chard, but disappointingly thin, especially for a reserve.

70868,Chile,"Interesting and not that far off the mark. Normally Chardonnay and Viognier make for clumsy partners, but not so in this case. The nose has sweet acacia blossom aromas, and that's followed by a plump but largely anonymous palate that turns to apricots and honey on the finish. A little cloying but good in small doses.",,84,8.0,Central Valley,,,Chardonnay-Viognier,Oveja Negra
70869,Spain,"Red cherry, cough drop and a touch of mushroom work the nose, while in the mouth it's crisp and pointed, with light red fruit and citrus-influenced flavors. A lean, lithe wine very much in the pie cherry realm.",Crianza,84,11.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Montecillo
70870,Spain,"This semisweet white can come across likable or awful, depending on your mood and the shape of the bottle you're drinking.

70872,Chile,"This is a hulking berry-driven wine with big, jammy aromas. And ultimately it is nothing more than an average Chilean red, meaning it has bulk and color but not much individuality or character. The 2005 version of this wine has more bounce and personality. We say stick to that.",Estate,83,8.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Syrah-Cabernet,Estampa

70878,US,"Bright floral and tropical flavors are enveloped in a lush sweetness here, creating an overall character that is not complex, but is appealing.

70880,US,"From Steele, although it's hard to tell why they don't say so on the label.

70881,Chile,"Caliterra's Tribute series, if this is any example, features pretty heavy oak treatment. Here we're talking sawmill style, meaning the nose is buxom and burnt.

70885,Chile,"Basic pear, apple and melon—your so-called usual suspects—work the bouquet, while on the palate it's largely about oak-infused candied fruit.

70887,Chile,"A lot of color but short in the finesse department. What you have here is a big, buxom, young Merlot with aggressive aromas and tart, underdeveloped raspberry and plum flavors. Has looks but no polish.",Vineyard Selection,83,8.0,Maule Valley,,,Merlot,TerraNoble

70904,New Zealand,"Although the aromas of this off-dry Riesling are marked by lime and floral notes, there's also an intriguing dark earthiness that imparts gravity and complexity.

70905,South Africa,"Spicy plum and black currant aromas lead this stylish red blend. On the palate, savory black fruit and pepper flavors are poised and elegant, and not too big.

It's full bodied, with steely tannins and a long finish of fig and char. Try with a pan-seared steak.",Solus,89,76.0,Villány,,,Merlot,Gere Attila
70909,US,"With its sharp edges and muscular mouthfeel, this Cabernet Franc has the power to stand up to a variety of roasted or toasted foods. The fruit is ripe and supple, with lots of purple berries, plums and cassis. But what is best is the full-bodied finish, whose tannins impart a distinctly varietal green tea character.",,89,38.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Southern Oregon,Cabernet Franc,Griffin Creek
70910,France,"A dense, elegant wine, the berry fruits full of juice and fresh plums. The layer of tannins is firm, a clenched fist in the heart of the softer, riper fruit flavors. There is final fruit gum acidity.",,89,19.0,Bordeaux,Fronsac,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château la Longua
70911,US,"A feminine, almost soft Pinot Noir, this opens nicely with scents of roses, red fruits, and pine forest. Despite its light color, it has plenty of grip and density in the mouth, even bringing some streaks of light milk chocolate into the finish.",3 Vineyard,89,32.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Chehalem
70912,US,"A bit sharp now, which is the most glaring feature of this otherwise rich Pinot Noir. It's very dry, with a firmly tannic structure, while the cherry, cola, licorice and sandalwood flavors are delicious. Brief cellaring is warranted, but that sharpness is a warning that the long term may be a gamble.",Cuvée Sandra,89,55.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Demetria
70913,France,"Firm and rich wine, with the black fruits melding well with the tannins. It has plenty of structure, but that is still at a youthful stage. The final acidity adds freshness and brings in berry fruits.",,89,,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Grand Corbin
70914,France,"The wood gives a spicy aroma, and the palate has an attractive touch of ginger to go with the pink grapefruit and green plum flavors. A soft wine that has toast as well as ripe acidity.",,89,24.0,Bordeaux,Côtes de Bordeaux,,Sauvignon Blanc,Château Haut Bertinerie
70915,US,"With quite low alcohol (12.7%), this Gewürz has a little residual sugar, giving it a rich edge of honey. That's the perfect counterpoint to the pineapple, peach, lychee and Indian spice flavors that are so savory and crisp. Great buy in this exotic variety.",,89,12.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Gewürztraminer,Banyan
70916,Australia,"A thoroughly attractive and refreshing wine, with refined scents of lanolin, grapefruit peel and raw quince unfolding into a tightly wound, linear palate that's peppered with fresh ginger notes. It's strikingly crisp and bone dry but low in alcohol—just begging to be drunk at a raw bar. Open now for its youthful fruit or hold five years for more complexity and softness.",,89,15.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,Sémillon,Allandale
70917,Italy,"This Chardonnay-based Franciacorta sparkling wine offers piquant aromas of citrus, white pepper and stone fruit. The mouthfeel is compact and firm and the quality of the fine and persistent perlage is both evident to the eye and in the mouth.",Brut Cuvée Millesimato,89,40.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Chardonnay,Bersi Serlini
70918,Italy,Mandrarossa is the flagship wine of the all-women team at Bortolomiol. This Extra Dry style strikes a perfect balance between fruit and floral sweetness and cleansing acidity. Serve this beautiful wine at cocktail hour.,Bandarossa Millesimato Extra Dry,89,24.0,Veneto,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,,Glera,Bortolomiol
70919,Australia,"There's definitely some horsey notes on the nose, but the decadent palate, with its intoxicating blend of raspberry, loganberry and cranberry, all couched in a sophisticated vanilla and coffee framework, takes the day. Medium-to-long finish shows grippy tannins. Drink now or cellar several years.",The Villain,89,20.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hugh Hamilton
70920,US,"Tough going with this wine. It's very dry, and shows the high acidity of the variety, and even some rasping tannins. Unfortunately, the fruit isn't there, despite a modest attempt by the cherry squad to come to the rescue.",Estate Bottled,83,19.0,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Sierra Foothills,Sangiovese,Amador Foothill Winery
70921,Chile,"Warm and chunky, with a fair amount of compost and mushroom to the bouquet. Flavors of lean raspberries and green herbs are less than stunning, while the mouthfeel seems a bit crisp and tight. Adequate but not very generous or ripe.",,83,7.0,Central Valley,,,Carmenère,Chilensis
70922,Spain,"Right from the start you know this wine is challenged. The nose is lean and green, with hints of tea and citrus peel. In the mouth, it's snappy and traditional, meaning there's American oak dill notes brushing up against rhubarb and red cherry. Proponents will cite its “classic” character while others will call it thin and not very rewarding.",,83,11.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Marqués de la Concordia
70923,US,"Definitely on the ripe, hot side, with blackberry flavors veering all the way into shrivelled raisins. With lots of new oak, the wine is fully dry, but at the cost of very high alcohol, 15.6%, which gives the palate a Port-like burn.",J.D. Hurley,83,20.0,California,Santa Clara Valley,Central Coast,Merlot,Martin Ranch
70924,US,"Your basic country Cab, with ripe blackberry fruit accented by oak, and firm tannins. It's a bit on the sweet side.",,83,18.0,California,Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Cabernet Sauvignon,Guenoc
70925,US,"Not much going on with this Pinot. Smells thin, tastes thin, with tart acidity that's accentuated by the lack of generosity. Has just enough cherry-cola fruit to score at the bottom of our “good” scale.",Brosseau Vineyard,83,50.0,California,Chalone,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Harrington
70926,Spain,"Spearmint and untamed wild berry aromas start it down a slope that ends with a palate that's hot and heavy with fruit but devoid of balance and touch. There's a lot of this and that, namely vanilla and oak. But overall the wine just gets it together.",Crianza,83,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Rioja Vega
70927,US,"Soft, dry and thin in flavor, except for a splash of cherries and blackberries that disappears rapidly on the finish.",,83,19.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Hall
70928,US,"Hot in alcohol, with sweetened blackberry and raisin flavors. A good example of a Port-like table wine.",Three Vines,83,28.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Manzanita Creek
70929,Spain,"Cheerful but basic raspberry aromas and flavors is what this young Rioja is about. It feels a little bulky at first, and then acids swell up to cut it short. Almost snappy in the late innings.",,83,8.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Rioja Vega
70930,US,"A bit raw, but dry and crisp, with a pleasantly silky mouthfeel. The cherry, cola and wintergreen flavors finish with a bite of acidic sharpness.",,83,18.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Pietra Santa
70931,Spain,"This wine is not typical of Allende. It suffered from the heat of 2003 and thus it's overtly aromatic in a prune-like way and out of balance on the palate. If it weren't for the unusual but intriguing molasses aromas and the occasional blast of quality berry fruit, we'd dismiss it outright. Better to wait for the 2004.",,83,27.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Finca Allende
70932,US,"Thin, dry and citrusy-grassy, with some feline scents. Not much going on, but the price is okay for everyday.",,83,10.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Ironstone
70933,Chile,"This is the first we've seen of this brand, and frankly the wine is overdone with toast to the point that char functions as a blanket over underripe, mildly vegetal fruit. It's roasted, herbal and a little hot.",Casas Patronales,83,9.0,Maule Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Viña Casas Patronales
70934,Chile,"Light and citrusy, and also fairly green. This is your standard stripped down model that pushes green apple, green melon and lime. Get the picture? It's a green wine that has freshness but not much depth.",Casas Patronales,83,9.0,Maule Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Viña Casas Patronales
70935,US,"This is not the best example of unoaked Chard. Without any enriching barrel notes, the wine shows raw, thin fruit, citrusy and green.",Oak Free,83,22.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,St. Supéry
70936,US,"Nice flavors, with cherry-pie filling, raspberry, root beer, gingerbread, smoke and vanilla spice flavors. But it's made in an exaggerrated modern style, so soft and apparently sweet that it really fails to find balance.",,83,16.0,California,Clear Lake,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Cabernet Franc,Steele
70937,Spain,"An attempt at high-end Tempranillo that comes across rough and tough and not too friendly. The nose is rubbery and dark, while the palate is big and generic, with chocolate on the back end. But where this wine gets you is in feel: it's a tannic monster.",Finca los Meriños,83,60.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Luberri
70938,US,"Fast food will find a fast friend with this. It doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is. Dry and simple, it shows cherry and earthy flavors.",,83,10.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Shiraz,Ironstone
70939,US,"There are some pretty features to this wine, namely the lovely tannins and rich fruit, but it's just too soft and sweet. Tastes like blackberry jam, with extra white sugar spinkled on top.",Signature,83,45.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Byington
70940,US,"Dry, crisp and elegant, but too watery-thin in flavor. The palate struggles to savor the modest citrus flavors.",Leola,83,22.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Coniglio
70941,Chile,"Citrus is the overriding component, but there are touches of apple and apricot on the nose. In the mouth, it's all about orange and tangerine and really not much else. A citrus ball if ever there was one.",,83,7.0,Central Valley,,,Chardonnay,TerraNoble
70942,Chile,"Woodsy berry aromas keep the nose upright and welcoming, but the palate doesn't do much other than push generic raspberry and cherry skin flavors. It's a forward, rather acidic wine that's simple and straightforward.",Reserva,83,11.0,Maipo Valley,,,Carmenère,Porta
70943,US,"Tastes flat and simple, with fruit disappearing, although there's a ghost of blackberries that turns a little more intense on the finish. Consume now.",,83,16.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Prospero
70944,Chile,"There's a movement in Chile toward the Limari Valley for cooler-climate grapes like Sauvignon Blanc, yet this one hasn't really found its groove. The wine seems a bit soft and distant, with dilute aromas and flavors of peach, melon and apple. Yet the body is moderate to heavy, and the finish is sort of mealy.",,83,12.0,Limarí Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Peñalolen
70945,US,"Too soft and too sweet, with sugared cherry, raspberry, blackberry and chocolate flavors. Okay and clean, but with this inherent sweetness, the wine could use more balancing acids and tannins.",,83,12.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Melanto Terrace
70946,Chile,"Heavy and mossy, with foresty aromas that transition toward burnt. The palate runs scratchy and sharp, with red plum and cherry skin flavors. Has its qualities but in general it runs with too much heat and friction.",Reserva,82,9.0,Central Valley,,,Syrah,Chilensis
70947,US,"Some green, herbal flavors thin down the apricots and peaches in this simple wine, while the oaky overlay is too strong for the meager fruit.",,82,20.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Acacia
70948,Canada,"Peach, orange and tropical fruit on the nose and a balance of acid and sweetness are appealing, but this wine is a touch watery and needs more substance. Imported by Specialty Cellars.",Grand Reserve Classic,82,28.0,Ontario,Niagara Peninsula,,Riesling,Konzelmann
70949,US,"Simple, frankly sweet and way too soft, this tastes like sugared apricot and peach syrup. Would be an interesting wine with a lot more acidity.",,82,25.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Riesling,Rideau
70950,Australia,"A great representative of Australian Grenache, with flavors of black fruit, road tar and raspberry liqueur fading to a palate of brambly fruit, all of which is couched in mocha and vanilla tones from toasty French oak. There's a bit of raspberry jam and a faint grip on the medium finish. Drink now.",Old Vine,89,25.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Grenache,Yangarra Estate Vineyard
70951,France,"Gorgeously nuanced nose, with almond, marzipan, melon, lime and fresia up front, set against a palate of Brazil nut and cinnamon toast. Soft and lush, the long finish picks up a nutmeg accent. Noticeable sweetness suggests this wine will work well as an apéritif. Drink now for its freshness or cellar a few years for more complexity.",Grand Cru Mambourg,89,35.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Pierre Sparr
70952,US,"Made in an immediately accessible style, this is a softly gentle, silky Pinot Noir with lots of delicious flavor. Brims with cherry pie filling, cola, anise, cinnamon and smoky, spicy sandalwood. Charming now, and complex enough for fine grills and roasts.",La Encantada Vineyard,89,42.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Twin Oaks
70953,New Zealand,"Made in a medium-sweet style with only 9% alcohol, this is an intensely flavored wine filled with green apple and lime. There's a touch of petrol on the nose, and it reappears on the long, sweet-tart finish.",Envoy,89,,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Spy Valley
70954,Germany,"A different aromatic profile here, with bread dough and wet grass scents dominating the nose. It's well structured, with good flowery intensity in the mouth and a weighty, medium-to-long finish. Drink now.",Johannisberger Klaus Spätlese,89,43.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Johannishof
70955,Italy,"Here's an elegant Italian sparkler with toasty aromas of roasted nut, dried fruit and freshly baked bread. The wine offers cleansing acidity and steely perlage that keeps the palate refreshed sip after sip. The blend here is Chardonnay and Pinot Bianco with a small percentage of Pinot Nero.",Prima Cuvée Brut,89,28.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,Monte Rossa
70956,US,"This forward, light, elegant wine sports bright raspberry fruit flavors first and foremost. Young and fresh, it drinks like a good cru Beaujolais, but with a little bottle age could reveal more inner stuffing.",,89,30.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Adelsheim
70957,New Zealand,The 2008 Alana Estate Pinot boasts a perfumed bouquet that includes elements of rose petals and sandalwood to accent savory and black-cherry notes. The silky texture is also spot on; one just wishes for a little more flavor intensity and length. Drink it over the next few years.,Single Vineyard,89,50.0,Martinborough,,,Pinot Noir,Alana Estate
70958,France,"A solidly tannic wine, the dusty tannins suspended in the chunky fruits. Black currants are prominent, but so is a rich character that is developing well, aided by the sweet wood that balances the wine's initial dryness.",,89,,Bordeaux,Graves,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Haut Selve
70959,New Zealand,"Le Sol's little brother isn't yet available in the U.S., but it offers a decent introduction to the Craggy Range style of Syrah. Brandied cherries, complete with cinnamon and nutmeg are big and extracted; muscular yet not overdone, turning silky and mouthwatering on the finish.",Gimblett Gravels Vineyard,89,,Hawke's Bay,,,Syrah,Craggy Range
70960,US,"This was presented from a bottle that had been open for a day. The scents and flavors were a bit muted, with plump plum and blueberry fruit, a whiff of animal and herb. The acidity has a strong citrus character that juts out, even after so much time to breathe.",Mark Bradford Vineyard,89,90.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Domaine Serene
70961,New Zealand,"An intense, powerful Pinot, with dark coffee, cedar and plum notes balanced by hints of red raspberries. The texture is dense and plush, and the wine finishes warm and velvety, with a savory lick of oak spice.",Te Rehua,89,55.0,Martinborough,,,Pinot Noir,Escarpment
70962,US,"Cab Franc has always been one of the best potential wines in these Foothills, and now, veteran Easton tackles it with special focus. This is a good, medium-bodied wine, with pleasurable flavors of cherries, cola, bacon and sweet smoky oak. Has more elegance than you might think at this price.",Monarch Mine Vineyard,89,20.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Cabernet Franc,Easton
70963,US,"A little hot and peppery, but it's Sonoma Zin, and a chunk of grilled beef will be a great match to the heat and tannins. This drily robust wine has flavors of wild berries, cherries, bacon and Asian spices. Drink now.",,89,22.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hobo
70964,Italy,"This Chardonnay-based Satèn sparkler delivers intense aromas of yellow fruit, sourdough and roasted almond. The mouthfeel is plush and cushiony thanks to the foamy effervescence and those long-lasting fruit flavors.",Satèn Millesimato,89,41.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Chardonnay,Majolini
70965,Spain,"Opens with rooty, mature aromas of tobacco, baked berry and raisin, while the palate is full and roasted, with sweet baked-plum and brown sugar flavors. Mature and ready to go, with head-to-toe sweetness and molasses accents. Not a hard, tannic wine. Drink now through 2012.",Montsalvat,89,79.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Francesc Sanchez Bas
70966,Hungary,"This blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot is rich, complex and brawny, with strawberry on the nose, raspberry on the tongue, and a firm structure of fresh acidity and dense tannins. Best after a few years in the cellar.",Kopar,89,60.0,Villány,,,Red Blend,Gere Attila
70967,Australia,"Bold and oaky, this Shiraz-Cab blend starts out with notes of sawdust but quickly turns to guava and roses, backed up by earth and cigar. The muscular tannins and sinewy acidity could use two to three years cellaring to integrate better.",Bernoota,89,25.0,South Australia,Langhorne Creek,,Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon,Lake Breeze
70968,US,"An appealing mix of fruit and forest floor aromas waft from the glass, leading you into a tart, spicy and earthy wine with well-balanced red fruits, white pepper, bark and graphite flavors. Modest in scale, beautifully balanced, and perfect for near-term enjoyment.",Grande Cuvée,89,25.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Soléna
70969,Italy,"Compact, solid and well built, this sparkling wine from northern Italy delivers a nice aromatic package of stone fruit, toasted almond, Golden Delicious apple and yellow rose. The effervescence here is bright, persistent and cleansing.",Brut Talento,89,14.0,Northeastern Italy,Trento,,Sparkling Blend,Rotari
70970,South Africa,"Thelema's trademark mintiness is a star here, as are the rich, savory flavors of black currant, coffee and spice on the palate. Poised but giving, the wine has an ageable quality and will be delicious with roast lamb or beef.",,89,41.0,Stellenbosch,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Thelema
70971,France,"Just off-dry, with intense flower and stone fruit aromas and a silky, decadent texture. The finish of white cherries, fig and lemon goes on and on. Drink now for its lovely, youthful fruit or stash it for a few years for more complexity.",Cuvée Cecile,89,30.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Lucien Albrecht
70972,France,"A firm, spicy wine, its fruit and tannins showing the character of the vintage, but also with some weight. The tannins are dense rather than hard and the berry fruits are juicy, but manage to keep high acidity at bay. A success.",Château d'Arche,89,25.0,Bordeaux,Haut-Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Mähler-Besse
70973,Italy,"Here's a brightly pink-colored rosé sparkling wine with aromas of wild berry, toasted bread, dried fruit and ground white peppercorn. There's personality and intensity here and the wine washes clean over the palate thanks to its bright effervescence.",Altèra Brut Rosé,89,48.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Pinot Nero,Majolini
70974,US,"Good price for a firm, steely Chardonnay that's elegant and dry through the finish. Minerals and citrus fruits mark it, with a Meyer lemon tartness given added richness from 25% new oak fermentation. Ready now.",Estate,89,18.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Laetitia
70975,Greece,"This elegant, aromatic white combines pear and flowers with a crisp, citrusy lift. Good minerality and depth with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. A unique, pretty white that is a standout as a solo sip or with lighter fare.",Private Label White,89,,Attica,,,Savatiano,My Big Fat Greek Wine
70976,Italy,"Elegant and tight, this pale pink sparkling wine boasts a wide array of small fruit and floral aromas. This vibrant wine would pair well with fried calamari or shellfish thanks to its delicate nature and bright acidity.",Rosé Talento,89,14.0,Northeastern Italy,Trento,,Sparkling Blend,Rotari
70977,France,"A lovely expression of place, with exuberant aromas of honey, beeswax, lanolin and gardenias, giving way to carnations and rosewater in the mouth. The palate is dry and almost chalky in its mineral expression. Finishes on a vanilla note. Drink now or hold several years for even more complexity.",Clos St. Landelin,89,,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,René Muré
70978,France,"Soft, dusty tannins balance a wine that is full of the ripest fruit. It has power, but gentle power, with rounded corners and a texture that is dense, never hard. The fruits are ripe plums, perhaps lacking final freshness.",,89,35.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château de Ferrand
70979,US,"High alcohol, approaching 16%, compromises this wine. If you can get past the heat and superripeness, it defines one aspect of the modern style, in a flashy, Napa way. Offers massive waves of jammy blackberries and mocha, and is probably best now and for a couple of years.",,89,60.0,California,Atlas Peak,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Coniglio

70981,Chile,"Quite sweet to the nose, and then strapping and aggressive on the palate. The flavors of gooseberry and sweet bell peppers are not easy to wrap yourself around, and it finishes kind of clunky.",Colección Especial,82,10.0,Maule Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Melania
70982,US,"Way too hot and high in alcohol. This wine cannot handle the 16%; the fruit isn't here, except for some raisins, leaving behind pure heat.",Jack Rabbit Flat,82,30.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Renwood

70988,Romania,"Citrus and peach aromas lead with this semi-sweet wine from Vanju Mare, the wine region situated in southern Romania.

Imported by Vidalco International, LLC.",Demi-Dulce,82,14.0,Vânju Mare,,,Riesling,Sevruga
70989,US,"Delicate apple flavors dominate this enjoyable but simple wine, which still has enough body to hold its own against a spicy Asian dish or a platter of robust seafood. Good acids and a pretty finish round out the deal.",Father and Son Cuvée,82,9.0,Texas,Texas,,Riesling,Messina Hof

70992,Slovakia,"Slovakian winemaker Miroslav Petrech and German Riesling notable Egon Müller grow the grapes for this pretty, floral Riesling on the banks of the Danube River. It's fine for a warm-weather quaff but missing the delicate layers of an exemplary Riesling. Great nose.",,82,15.0,Muzla,,,Riesling,Château Bela
70993,US,"This is rife with earthy spice on the nose and on the palate, some of that lively spice continues. But there's a lack of dimension and finesse here that would make this stand out. The intentions are good, but there's not enough here to support them.",,82,17.0,New Jersey,New Jersey,,Riesling,Cape May
70994,Romania,"Sappy sweet flavors of orange and flowers meet somewhat clumsily in this wine from Vanju Mare. Heavy and musky on the palate, the wine nonetheless has a nice, lingering finish and an appealing aroma.",Premier Harvest,82,10.0,Dealu Mare,,,Riesling,Dreamer
70995,US,"Honey, pineapple and pear on the nose are continued on the palate. The flavors are quite pretty but the overall structure of the wine tends toward watery; could use more acid and strength. Still, enjoy it chilled on a patio or in a hammock and you'll find it an enjoyable, affordable warm-weather choice.",,82,9.0,New Mexico,New Mexico,,Riesling,Blue Teal
70996,US,"Not a success. The wine has a rustic feeling, and is so soft, it makes the cola and cherry flavors taste syrupy. Lacks life and vivacity.",Estate Grown,82,34.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,WillowBrook Cellars
70997,Spain,"Stewed fruit aromas with some baked beans on the side just isn't alluring, and the lean, raw, acidic palate that some might describe as traditional isn't clicking in my book. Saving graces include milk chocolate on the finish.",Reserva,82,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Baron De Ley
70998,Romania,"A dancing, fragrant nose and appealing flavors of apple and flowers makes this semi-sweet selection from Romania a fun wine to try with spicy and seafood dishes. It's a little heavy on the palate but it's adaptable and an interesting alternative from a lesser-known wine-producing country.",Selection Semi-Sweet,82,11.0,Romania,,,Riesling,Beloaré
70999,Chile,"Leather and spice are the more appealing aromas, while the palate features tightly wound but limited raspberry and red berry flavors. A narrow wine with snap, acidity and tartness but not much wealth or richness.",,82,7.0,Central Valley,,,Syrah,Chilensis

71001,US,"Supple and silky, it's a soft, gentle wine, but with plumped raisin flavors that taste sugary sweet side by side with a harshly green edge of chlorophyll, suggesting uneven ripening.",Vintner's Collection,82,10.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Sterling
71002,Spain,"An earthy style with pickle barrel and leather on the nose. Dark berry flavors are muddled, and there's an odd twinge of citrus to the flavor profile. Never really gets it going and seems murky. Two samples tasted.",Don Roman,82,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Marques de Tomares
71003,Chile,"Ripe to the point that it's soft and flat. Big apple and banana flavors run the palate, while the finish is so low in acid that it takes on extra weight. Inoffensive but devoid of a measurable pulse.",,82,8.0,Maule Valley,,,Chardonnay,Melania
71004,Chile,"Heavy aromas of horse stable and compost give this wine a classic “barnyard” nose, and while it does settle somewhat it always maintains its bramble and tomato flavor profile. This is herbal, rough Shiraz and no matter the size or oak it's a tough trek.",Tribute,81,17.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Shiraz,Caliterra
71005,South Africa,Imported by Harvett Wine Company.,,81,18.0,Stellenbosch,,,Merlot,Amani
71006,Chile,"No matter how much color this has, the basics are at once aggressive and boring. The nose is brambly and lean, a sure indication of limited, tangy flavors that carry some serious herbal character. There's little to this Syrah.",Vineyard Selection,81,8.0,Maule Valley,,,Syrah,TerraNoble
71007,Chile,"Light and airy, with floral apple and cleanser aromas. The palate is sweet and melony, but is it Sauvignon Blanc? Hard to tell, really; this tastes as much like your average jug white as it does Sauvignon Blanc.",Reserva,81,9.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Chilensis
71008,Romania,"There's an appealing minerality and subtle touch of apple in this wine from Romania, but the overall character lacks cohesion and elegance. Riesling should certainly have a light touch at its best, but this wine just feels tired. Imported by Vidalco International, LLC.",Sec,81,14.0,Vânju Mare,,,Riesling,Sevruga

71010,France,"This powerful white has an intriguing nose of toasted almonds, spiced orange and almond cookies while the mouth is an explosion of intense nut, cinnamon and honey, set against a noticeable level of residual sugar. A good wine to savor on its own. Drink over the next three to four years.",Calcaire,89,40.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht

71012,Italy,"This is a genuine and straightforward rosé sparkler with bright berry aromas followed by citrus, pink grapefruit and passionfruit. The wine is tight and tonic in the mouth and would pair nicely with smoked salmon or tuna carpaccio.",Essence Rosé,89,45.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,Antica Fratta
71013,France,"A complex, concentrated wine, powered by chocolate, dark plum skins and spice. The fruit is rich, superripe, but well balanced, leaving tight tannins and acidity. Worth aging another year.",Château Bois Chantant,89,,Bordeaux,Bordeaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Bernard Magrez
71014,US,"Easy to see why they picked this for the reserve. It's considerably more dense and complex than the winery's regular '07 Pinot, with multi¬tiered flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, currants, bacon, red licorice, peppery spices and oak. Could use greater structural depth, though, and probably at its best now–2013.",HMR Estate Reserve,89,50.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Adelaida
71015,South Africa,"This Shiraz speaks of its terroir, with its savory black pepper, plum and cassis nose and balanced black fruit, spice and cedar flavors. Full of ripe, rich fruit and tied together with an elegant spicy backbone. Pair with grilled meat or go spicy and try Asian or Mexican alongside.",1685,89,19.0,Coastal Region,,,Shiraz,Boschendal
71016,US,"Here's a pleasant, fruity, rich Bordeaux blend that impresses for its sheer wealth of flavor. Floods the mouth with blackberries, cherries, red and black currants and sweet, smoky oak, with firm but finely ground tannins. Feels direct and simple now, but that could be a function of youth. Try holding for 4–6 years and see where it goes.",Artistry,89,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Girard
71017,Spain,"A dry, oily, piquant Oloroso that's more peanutty than almondy. The palate is racy due to no shortage of acidity, and the flavor profile is led by a salty, briney almond and leather character. Sheer and serious, with not a sugar cube in sight.",Alfonso Oloroso Seco,89,18.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Palomino,González Byass

71020,US,"A bit tough and gritty now, with a chewy texture, like bacon or beef jerky. That's in addition to the cherry, cola, anise and sandalwood flavors. Give this wine a good decant before serving.",Reserve Bottling,89,52.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hawley
71021,US,"This estate reserve has more grip and tannin than the other 2006 Pinot from Winter's Hill. It has been in bottle for two years now, so you are buying a well cellared wine with significant flavor development. The fruit is first rate, and the wine is structured with plenty of acid and light barrel flavors of nougat and mocha.",Cuvée du Vigneron,89,39.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Winter's Hill

71024,France,"Based in the heart of the Entre-deux-Mers, this vineyard has ancient monastic origins. The 2005 is a well-balanced wine, structured with Cabernet and rounded with Merlot.

71028,US,"This Bordeaux blend is strong in oak and primary fruit flavors. It bursts in the mouth with an explosion of blackberry and cherry jam, caramel and buttered cinnamon toast. Delicious now, but a little direct and obvious. Hard to say where it's going.",Old Soldier Road Tephra Ridge Vineyard,89,40.0,California,Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Langtry
71029,Italy,"There's good aromatic intensity here in the form of peach, sourdough, yellow rose and honey-roasted almond.

71030,New Zealand,"At less than one-third the price of Escarpment's single-vineyard wines, this is a great Pinot Noir value.

71031,Australia,"There's weight, power and butteriness here but this wine is light on its feet, with fresh lime cordial and grapefruit peel notes and an intense, palate that's just shy of full-bodied. Long, vanilla-inflected finish. Drink now or stash away for 3–4 years for more complexity.",Isolation Ridge Vineyard,89,24.0,Western Australia,Frankland River,,Chardonnay,Frankland Estate

71033,Spain,"A bit heavy and raisiny, but with that said there's no denying the wine's richness and ripeness. Lush and dense in the mouth, with cocoa, roasted fruit and a mild syrupy lean to the flavor profile. Sweet but a little short on the finish, and condensed. Drink now through 2012.",Tinto Figuero 12 Crianza,89,29.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,García Figuero
71034,US,"What a nice Zin. Shows all the Dry Creek character you could ask for, with briary, brambly flavors of wild forest berries, peppery spices and chocolate-covered mints. Savory and delicious, a fine wine to drink now with barbecue. Alcohol is very high, but somehow the wine doesn't taste hot.",Stone Ranch,89,28.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,DeLorimier
71035,Australia,"The blend in this wine is as whimsical as the name, with Tempranillo and Grenache alongside Portugal's Tinta Cão and Souzão grapes. The result is an aggressive, powerful wine with a broad palette of aromas and flavors, ranging from vanilla, forest floor and animal sweat to cigar, flint, blackberry jam and coffee. Big, bold tannins. Better after 2011.",The Sticks & Stones Tempranillo-Grenache-Tintacao-Souzao,89,35.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Red Blend,D'Arenberg

71038,France,"With 14 months' new wood aging, this wine is still all wood and toast. The wine does have weight, with the promise of blackberry fruits under the firm tannins. It is finely structured and should mature well.",Péché du Roy,89,18.0,Bordeaux,Côtes de Bourg,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Haut-Guiraud
71039,Germany,"Soft at first, but the density of the pine, gardenia and spice flavors emerges as the wine opens up while the lingering finish shows excellent purity of fruit. Serve with sushi.

71040,Chile,"Every year the price on this wine creeps up and yet the quality falls. The 2006 is a load and a half at 14.5%, and it has virtually no zest or acidity to keep it balanced. It's full of banana and mealy pear flavors, and the pleasure quotient is close to zero.",,81,11.0,Rapel Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Lapostolle

71050,Chile,"Haven't tasted Sauvignon Blanc from TerraNoble before, and that's a good thing. This is a heavy, nutty, oily wine that's a touch caustic and tough to wrestle with. If this winery's going to continue with SB it should be better than this.",,80,7.0,Central Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,TerraNoble

71053,Spain,"We are big fans of most Sierra Cantabria wines, but this fading, overoaked white Rioja is more or less a dud.

It's hard to see the point. 250 cases made.",Organza,80,24.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,White Blend,Sierra Cantabria

71056,US,"Beautiful wine, lush and soft in the style of this warm vintage. It's immediately enjoyable for the wealth of cherries, blackberries and raspberries, with a decadent edge of melted milk chocolate. Oak adds extra dimensions of smoky vanilla, caramel, butterscotch and gingerbread. Those who think they don't like red wine will enjoy. Hard to tell if it has the stuffing for the long haul, but it's gorgeous now and for the next six years.",Special Selection,97,136.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Caymus
71057,Spain,". Stand up and take note: this is great wine from Priorat. And that's regardless of whether it is typically Priorato in style. It trades textbook minerality for lushness, and the fruit is star quality. In the mouth, there's an explosion of grape matter that leaves coffee, chocolate, peanut brittle and vanilla. Almost drinkable right now but best from 2009.",,96,85.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Vall Llach
71058,US,"This is a best-barrels blend whose proceeds go charity. The '05 is a blend of Silver Pines, Van der Kamp, Chris Lee and others, and it's gorgeous. Rewards for its high acid, silky feel, so light and airy, and for the intensity of cola, cherry, pomegranate, smoky vanilla cream and Asian spice flavors that last on the finish. Should pick up additional nuance for the next four years.",Auction Block,95,54.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
71059,US,"This is glorious stuff. Dunham's first vineyard designated Cab is an absolute home run. Pure, dense Cabernet flavors fill the glass, at once forward and open, yet firm and concentrated. The lush black fruits roll through followed with lacy layers of smoke, tea, earth and tobacco. This wine just keeps on going; cellar it if you can keep your hands off it, or treat yourself and drink it today.",Lewis Vineyard,94,75.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dunham
71060,US,"This 72% Syrah/ 28% Cab Sauvignon blend, from the biodynamic Cailloux vineyard, displays characteristic aromas that mix silage, moist earth, resin, green tea and mixed herbal aromatics. The base flavor is bready, yeasty, leesy; the fruits are compact and hinting at pomegranate, strawberry and red plum. The Cab adds a pleasing minerality to the finish. Cellar Candidate (up to 10 years).",Rediviva of the Stones,94,40.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Buty
71061,US,"The wine is owned by the Smiths, who started La Jota and know from Howell Mountain Cabernet. Judging from the last few bottlings, it's off to a promising start. Dry, rich and balanced, fruit is the star here, with explosive blackberries and cherries, while 100% new oak adds lush layers of cedar and smoke. Fully enjoyable now, with decanting; it should enjoy a long life for at least 10 years.",Purple Label,94,54.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Piedra Hill
71062,Argentina,"As good as it gets from Argentina. Winemaker Jorge Riccitelli has artfully crafted a bruising but lovable modern Bordeaux blend that hits every note on the head. The nose offers black olive, berry essence and a ton of chocolate, while the tannic but balanced palate sports luscious black cherry, cassis and more. For a stud of a wine, it has nuance and character—meaning it's not just a fat fruitball. At 70% Malbec with Merlot and Cabernet, this is the ideal wine for a great steak. Just 250 cases produced.",Perdriel Single Vineyard,94,64.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Bodega Norton
71063,US,"With this wine Iron Horse takes a giant step toward great Chablis. By that I mean the intense dryness and zesty acidity, and the tangy grip of iron and wet stone that undergirds the Meyer lemon, pineapple zest, honeysuckle, apricot, cinnamon spice and new oak flavors. This Chard is all about structural integrity. It should have a useful life of at least six years, gaining momentum and nuance.",Rued Clone,94,35.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse
71064,US,"This is what people who pay a hundred bucks for a Napa Cab expect. Soft, ripe and enormously attractive, it seduces the palate with gooey red and black currant, cherry, blueberry, melted Swiss chocolate, anise and cedar flavors that just pile up and up and go on and on. The tannins, needless to say, are the finest money can buy. It's impossible not to be impressed by a wine of this pedigree and accomplishment. Probably at its succulent best now and for the next 6 years.",J. Daniel Cuvée,94,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lail
71065,US,"Stunning. Combines the fleshy opulence of a sweetly youthful Pinot with the balanced tightness and acidity of a young, cellar-worthy one. No small feat! From a cool vintage in a cool appellation that's increasingly known for Pinot Noir, the wine is pale in color and delicate in the mouth, yet powerful in cherry-cola and spice intensity. Gorgeous now, and should improve for six years before slowly bowing out.",Silver Pines Vineyard,94,54.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
71066,US,"One of the more dependable bottlings from Napa, the '03 is a lovely wine. Rich and balanced, it offers intense cassis, cherry-pie filling and coffee flavors, with a delicious overlay of new oak. The mountain tannins are firm and dusty, but very finely structured, ripe and sweet. Beautiful now, and should develop well for the next eight years or so.",Spaulding Vineyard Reserve,93,50.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonegate
71067,US,"I love the delicate complexity of this Pinot, which is a blend of five vineyards along this famous wine trail. If you want to understand RRV Pinot, and particularly from the stretch they call the Middle Reach, study this wine. Dry, crisp and silky, it shows beautifully ripened cherry, raspberry, cola, pomegranate and spicy-herbal flavors, perfectly integrated with smoky oak, and the brilliant acid-tannin balance of a great vintage.",Westside Road Neighbors,93,65.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
71068,Italy,"A blockbuster wine: big, bold and opulent on every front, you'll be seduced and subdued by its concentrated and immediate aromas of black berry fruit, pencil lead, licorice, chocolate fudge and the pretty ashen nuances. It's a masculine and multi-layered wine with expertly extracted flavors. This is a hearty wine that will cellar for many more years.",Piano di Montevergine Riserva,93,62.0,Southern Italy,Taurasi,,Aglianico,Feudi di San Gregorio
71069,Austria,"This powerful, intense, wood-aged Grüner Veltliner is Pfaffl's finest expression of the grape.

71071,New Zealand,"Spy Valley is turning out consistently good wines across the range, and the 2008 Pinot Noir is a notable achievement in the context of the vintage.

71073,US,"The vineyard is on the lower slopes of Atlas Peak. It's a good wine, made from 100% Cabernet, with finely ground tannins and strong flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate and lots of sweet new oak. One deficiency is high alcohol, which gives the wine an unbalanced, glyceriney sweetness.",D'Adamo Vineyard,89,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Piña
71074,Spain,"Earthy and crusty at first, with smoked meat, black fruit and dryness to the nose. The palate is well formed and proper, with dry raspberry and mild chocolate flavors.

71075,New Zealand,"Matariki's Reserve Cab boasts true varietal notes of mint and cassis upfront, then turns intense and chocolaty on the palate.

71080,US,"A very good Cabernet, rich and dry, but you'll want to decant it for a few hours to let it soften. Right out of the bottle it's rough, giving a gritty feeling to the ripe blackberries and currants. Drink now–2012.",,88,35.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clarbec

71091,Spain,"A super sweet, potent brew that takes no prisoners as it hits with powerful toffee, caramel and alcohol aromas.

71097,Spain,"Having really liked this wine a couple of years ago, this vintage seems comparatively fierce and aggressive, which isn't to say it isn't hugely flavorful and aromatic.

71101,US,"A great big, oaky wine; it's full-bodied, tannic and incredibly fruity.

71103,US,"I love this Pinot for its dry silkiness, fruit, and the way it's so complex and ever-changing in the glass.

71105,US,"I love this for its absolute dryness and crispness and minerally depth. There's something coldly metallic in the taste and mouthfeel, and to the extent there's fruit, it's of grapefruits and lime zest, with a flowery exoticness.

The blend is 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, and a splash each of Cabernet Franc and Petite Verdot. Half is Horse Heaven Hills fruit, one quarter Cold Creek and one quarter Wahluke Slope.

71166,US,"Similar to the winery's '05 Russian River bottling in the ripeness of the fruit and tannins, but somehow fresher, although it's still a big, full-bodied Pinot Noir. Maybe it's the acidity that makes the framboise and cherry flavors come alive. Deeper notes of Portobello mushrooms and balsamic suggest moderate aging possibilities. Drink now through 2009.",,91,39.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
71167,Argentina,"Purple as can be, with a loaded bouquet of black fruit and oak. This is your classic heavyweight, and while 2004 was not a great vintage in Mendoza, this wine still shows excellent depth, weight and balance. Firm on the finish, with big tannins and grab. Production was only 175 cases; drink now–2009. Imported by Southern Wine Group.",Firmado,91,90.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
71168,US,"Made with 82% Cabernet, this interesting wine is showing all kinds of possibilities. It's a good red now, sturdily dry and tannic, with red cherry, pomegranate, sweet tobacco and allspice flavors. But it's a little juvenile. I would decant it as long as possible, and it should enjoy a cellar life of up to 10 years.",Chairman's Club,91,85.0,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère,Chalk Hill
71169,Spain,"One of the best efforts we've tried from Jumilla, Luzon's luxury blend starts with coconut, mint, char and fudge, and below that is a treasure trove of deep black fruit. Huge blackberry and black cherry flavors are potent as they ride on a wave of jolting tannins. An affordable shining star for a rising region.",Altos de Luzón,91,16.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Red Blend,Bodegas Luzón
71170,US,"Iron Horse joins the unoaked Chard bandwagon with this dry, complex wine. Their estate grapes are so good, the wine doesn't even need all that wood. It's elaborately tailored in pineapple, mango, ripe white peach and spicebox flavors. The vanilla and smoke, which have got to come from the grapes, add extra deliciousness.",UnOaked,91,25.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse
71171,Spain,"This younger-vines mix of Garnacha, Carignan, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah is very attractive and loaded with graphite, schisty mineral and black cherry aromas. The palate comes in waves, with the first delivering plum and berry and the second offering chocolate, herbs and lavender. Quite pretty and very tannic. Hold until 2008, if possible.",Les Sentius,91,35.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Joan Simó
71172,US,"Despite its youth, this is a complete and satisfying wine. Woodward Canyon reds virtually always develop well in bottle, and so you can assume that this will continue to improve. At the moment it is tightly wound, firmly built, a complex weave of purple fruit and tobacco leaf, leading into white chocolaty tannins.",,91,39.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Woodward Canyon
71173,US,"Long Shadows Pirouette is made by Agustin Huneeus and Philippe Melka; it's 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Merlot, 11% Syrah and 13% Petit Verdot. Aromatic and seductive, it sends waves of perfumed fruit, dusty cocoa, bright espresso and toasted grain from the glass, leading into a soft, smooth and seamless palate. This rich and luscious wine could easily pass for a much pricier Napa Valley blend.",,91,55.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Pirouette
71174,Australia,"This impeccably made wine boasts a rich, almost unctuous mouthfeel that beautifully complements its flavors of blackberries, dried spices, toast and vanilla. It's delicious now, but the flavors are so young and primary it's hard to imagine it not being even better in another year or two. Long on the finish, with echoes of oak and fruit lingering elegantly.",,91,22.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Tapestry
71175,Italy,"Dark in color and deep in concentration, this is a ripe Aglianico-Piedirosso (80-20) blend with tones of mature red cherry, beets, roasted peanut, espresso and roasted red pepper.

71176,US,"The blend is 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot, 24% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot. Another fine effort from this young winery. Here is classic styling from a great vineyard source, with beautiful definition, and gorgeous, refined and sculpted fruit framed in concise, molded, firm tannins. The tart red fruit is wrapped in crisp acids and finished with tight, hard, slightly bitter tannins. The penetration and elegance of this wine are what stand out; it's young and compact and suggests a long life ahead.",Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,91,27.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,:Nota Bene
71177,Australia,"An interesting wine, in that it doesn't fit the current rage for blockbuster Shiraz. As winemaker Charles Whish says, “It doesn't have to be huge and rich and jammy—it needs to have finesse and length.” This vintage does show a slightly lifted, vinyl-like note on the nose, but then settles down to offer elegant flavors of plum, spice and vanilla. Finishes long. Drink now–2015.",Balmoral,91,45.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Rosemount
71178,Austria,"This is a gently medium-sweet wine, but that hardly does justice to the beautiful balance between the acidity, sweetness, freshness and lightness. It just floats, only given a slight pull earthwards by the mineral aftertaste.",Riesling am Berg,91,,Niederösterreich,,,Riesling,R&A; Pfaffl
71179,US,"A smashing success, this exceptional value is loaded with the typical fruit flavors of cut green apple, pineapple and melon.

Michelle
71180,US,"The wine, from a warm vintage, bursts with fruity charm, but this is a mountain Cab, and while acids are low, you'll find strong tannins. The combination of black currant, cherry, red plum and cocoa flavors with firm, sandpapery tannins is charming and complex. Finishes with a bit of high-alcohol sweetness.",,91,45.0,California,Mount Veeder,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cuvaison
71181,Australia,"Frankland River is turning out to be a fine source for Australian Rieslings, like this offering from Ferngrove.

Finishes long.",Cossack,91,22.0,Western Australia,Frankland River,,Riesling,Ferngrove
71182,Italy,"A 70-30 blend of Negroamaro grape and hearty Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a highly successful rendition with succulent concentration, a pretty purplish hue and a nice balance between ripe fruit and tar-like aromas. You'll detect blackberry, leather, spice, licorice and asphalt. A characteristic Cabernet Sauvignon note of bell pepper appears as well.",Nero,91,45.0,Southern Italy,Salento,,Red Blend,Conti Zecca
71183,Australia,"Effusively smoky and toasty, this flamboyant, full-bodied Chardonnay bursts with scents and flavors of grilled nuts and grilled peaches.

71184,Italy,"This 60-30-10 Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Aglianico blend is a real treat from southern Italy with interesting complexity and flushed out tones of small berry fruit, exotic spice, vanilla, espresso and leather.

71185,Austria,"An unusual blend of Chardonnay, Grüner Veltliner and Riesling that works so well, it's not possible to detect which varietal gives which characteristic to this richly layered wine. Aged in wood, this is ripe and concentrated with flavors of spring herbs along side firm minerality.",Weisse Reserve Vom Schloss,91,30.0,Niederösterreich,,,White Blend,Graf Hardegg
71186,US,"Rockpile, a mountainy region in Dry Creek Valley, has given in this warm vintage a big young Syrah. Dry and smooth, it bursts with enormously ripe cherry flavors, but also is very tannic. It's high in alcohol, a potential fault, but something in the acid-tannin structure keeps it balanced, and even elegant. Best now and for the next few years.",Rockpile Vineyard Haley's Reserve,91,50.0,California,Rockpile,Sonoma,Syrah,JC Cellars
71187,Spain,"Intense and deep, with plenty of licorice, leather and pepper encasing serious dark-berry aromas.

71188,Australia,"A top-notch effort, Stonier's Reserve Chardonnay boasts layers of richly textured fruit and oak hung on a frame of citrusy acidity.

71192,US,"Very full bodied and rich, almost too much for a variety that wants some nuance.

71193,Italy,"Bellussi Belcanto is a Dry (or slightly sweet) style Prosecco wine from the Cartizze cru that offers harmony, elegance and character.

71195,US,"Surprisingly tannic, considerably more so than the wonderful '05. There's a sting of astringency that shuts down the palate and emphasizes the dryness. Underneath are the blackberries, black currants and grilled meat of a fine red wine. The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and Malbec. Now–2012.",O.P.C.,88,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,Buoncristiani
71196,Spain,"A bit sweet and raisiny on the nose, but also dense and powerful. The palate runs rough and tannic, but there's enough richness and extract to allow for that. Flavors of cassis and raspberry are dark but snappy, while the finish has raisiny notes but also some edge. This one may improve with time; drink now through 2013.",Miros,88,19.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Peñafiel
71197,France,"Malbec is part of the blend in this wine, Bourg being one of the few places left in Bordeaux where it is planted. It may help explain the firm tannins and dark color in a wine that has weight and a solid structure.",,88,,Bordeaux,Côtes de Bourg,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Grand-Maison

71199,Italy,Here's a very toasty and nutty expression of sparkling Chardonnay (with 5% Pinot Bianco) from Brescia in Northern Italy that offers background aromas of dried fruit and apricot.

71200,France,"A finely balanced wine, its tannins kept well in place but there are tight fruits and a texture that shows an edge of acidity and green peppers.

71203,US,"One of the last 2007 Pinots to be released, this still seems as if a bit more time in bottle is in order. It's still sharp, aggressive, herbal, yet nicely detailed.

71207,US,"All the buttered toast, vanilla bean, apricot jam and pineapple crème brûlée you could want is here, but this lovely Chardonnay is lifted above the ordinary by a minerality that gives it a refreshing tang.

71210,Spain,"Starts out a bit sweaty and leathery, but soon it turns more smoky.

71211,Germany,"This is a zippy little number, with scents of white cherries and citrus that float over a bed of petroleum and fresia.

71213,US,"This is a very big, full-bodied Pinot Noir that's not particularly delicate or elegant in youth. It could almost be a Grenache, it's so dense, with cherry, cola, anise, pepper and oak flavors. Yet it's bone dry, and has everything it needs for the cellar.

71224,US,"Tannins and acids currently dominate, giving this dry, young wine a bit of a lockdown quality. The winemaker, Michael Trujillo, aims at a more structured style, and he has achieved it here.

71249,Spain,"Rustic fruit aromas led by the native Samso grape cause a stir, and the wine, which also has Garnacha, Cabernet and Merlot, carries forth in the mouth, where lush blackberry and plum flavors are supported by healthy, spicy, minty oak.

71255,US,"A bit of a fruit salad of a Pinot Gris, with pineapple, banana, mango, white peach and jicama all in the mix.

71257,US,"A blend of Marsanne, Grenache Blanc, Roussanne and Viognier. It's bone dry and zesty in acidity, showing an austerity of flavor that emphasizes minerals over fruit.

71267,US,"This is Zinfandel on steroids, which is the Wilson house style. The wine is dry, full bodied and very high in alcohol, approaching 16%.

71272,Italy,This is an excellent expression of Prosecco from one of our favorite producers. Adami's Extra Dry is a light and feminine wine with a beautiful embroidery of apple and honeysuckle.

71276,US,"This is a different style than past vintages of Freedom Hill, with less tannin and alcohol.

71279,US,"Lots of honey is the first impression; this is under 10% alcohol and over 5% residual sugar. Nicely balanced, it still has enough acidity to put a little tartness in the midpalate.

71282,US,"Showing quite a bit of tannins and acids, this is a very young wine, of a kind that isn't seen all that much in Russian River Valley these days. Swan makes their Pinots the old-fashioned way, for aging. Dry and astringent, the wine has a deep core of cherry and blackberry fruit, almost like a Merlot, except for the silkiness. Stick this in your cellar until 2008, at least.",Great Oak Vineyard,90,35.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
71283,Argentina,"Rich, warm and possessing a ton of dry oak, this is one serious Argentine Cabernet. The palate is grippy as a rubber glove, with snappy berry flavors and pointed acidity.

71285,Italy,"This is a beautifully crafted 40-30-30 blend of Cannonau, Carignano and Bovale with dark concentration and vibrant cherry fruit, bold espresso and background notes of toast, vanilla bean and cedar thanks to 12 months in barrique.

71286,US,"Clean and varietal. The fruit tastes of ripe apples, pears, and maybe a little bit of pineapple, and if there is new oak it has been gracefully melded into the wine so it does not stick out. Just a hint of sweet toast adorns the smooth, lingering finish; then fades with a lick of butterscotch at the tail end. A graceful, elegant debut for this new Walla Walla winery.",Conner Lee Vineyards,90,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Sapphire Mountain Cellars
71287,US,"Dry, sauvage and nicely detailed, this bright, tart, citrusy wine has a truly great mouthfeel.

Just 12.6% alcohol puts it squarely into the Sancerre range.",,90,9.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Fumé Blanc,Barnard Griffin
71288,France,"This is half barrel-fermented, and it shows in the wine's scents of toast, but there's plenty of fruit to back that up.

71289,Argentina,"Here's another success from Bodega Norton. The nose is rich and big, with crusty chocolate and coconut aromas.

It's New World pomp and pleasantness in all its glory.",Reserva,90,18.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Norton
71290,Argentina,"This wine needs time to get its legs underneath it. It comes on young and rugged and gamy, but if you let it sit and air out for 20 minutes it turns deeper, riper and much more fruity. And by the time it settles you're smack dab in the middle of mountain berry and other natural flavors. Will get better with some bottle time.",,90,17.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Finca Sophenia

Long and intense on the finish.",,90,25.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,,Riesling,Mesh
71293,Spain,"Sweet, succulent aromas draw you in and while the wine doesn't deliver much nuance on either the nose or palate, we can't quibble with the power, purity and intensity of the blackberry fruit.

71295,France,"A piercingly steely wine, all angles and acidity. That said, there's a greater depth of flavor that needs time to come out—the richness of the green fruit is there, as is the hint of wood. The corners need to soften for a year or so.",Montmain Premier Cru,90,33.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Joseph Drouhin
71296,US,"My experience of Swan Pinots is that they've been made the same way for a long time, and require aging. This one shows some hard tannins and even some tough acids, although it's tremendous in cherry-pie filling, black raspberry and blackberry jam flavors. Right now it feels juvenile, rude, even rustic, but five to eight years in the cellar will reward.",Trenton Estate Vineyard,90,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
71297,France,"Despite the different branding, this is a selection from the family's Domaine Barville in Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

71298,US,"This is bang-on clean and varietal Syrah, with a confident mix of sharp, toasty barrel flavors married to bright, acidic, berry-flavored fruit. Juicy and spicy, it's a great companion to the winery's Red Mountain Syrah, and shows the different character of the varied Washington terroir.

71299,Australia,"The star of the Rosemount lineup for its excellent quality-price ratio, this is a spicy, peppery wine that's infinitely more complex than the diamond-label offerings.

71300,Germany,"Kerner is a variety not often seen in the U.S., although it is among the top five most planted white grapes in Germany. It's a cross between Trollinger (a red grape) and Riesling, making for—in this case—a pretty, aromatic white with hints of muskmelon, tropical fruit, maybe even some red berries, all on a light frame. Long and refreshing on the finish.",,90,18.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Kerner,Weingut-Pension H.J.&E.; Lehmen

Notable also for the crisp, brisk mouthfeel.",Overlook,90,26.0,California,Sonoma County-Monterey County-Santa Barbara County,California Other,Chardonnay,Landmark
71305,US,"Fans of Petite Sirah will exult. This darkly brooding wine is heavy, tannic and fully dry, although at the cost of very high alcohol. The flavors, of extraordinarily ripe red and black cherries, currants, espresso, sweet leather and mushu plum sauce, finish with an unsweetened dark chocolate bitterness. It's a wine that will evolve over a decade.",Shannon Ranch,90,25.0,California,Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Petite Sirah,Marr

Young, tight and compact, may benefit from additional cellaring.",Two Vineyards,90,38.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Hedges
71307,US,"Straddles the line between villages-type and premier cru Pinot.

71309,France,"“Fullness and goodness” is a rough translation of the name of this wine. It's an accurate description of its richness. There is great spice, bolstering the full fruit, showing a mineral, chalky structure along with fresh green fruits.",Plénitude de Bonté,90,30.0,Burgundy,Pouilly-Fuissé,,Chardonnay,Collovray et Terrier
71310,Italy,"This Negroamaro-Aglianico blend opens slowly, then suddenly releases a rush of red cherry, toast, prune, leather and red earth.

71311,Argentina,"If you don't mind a little overt wood on your Malbec, then this will certainly do the trick and more.

71312,US,"The chardonnay is the largest production wine made at Barnard Griffin. It is a stellar wine, about half barrel fermented, the other half stainless; a beautiful blend of crisp, fresh, creamy, leesy, textural white peach and light citrus fruit.

71313,US,"This is a smooth blend of Red Mountain and Horse Heaven Hills Merlot, with a generous (18%) supplement of Cabernet Sauvignon. It's consistent with previous efforts and reminiscent of Reininger—satiny smooth, glossy and somewhat impenetrable. The tightly wound fruits taste of ripe raspberry, and the bright acidity adds intensity to the toasty, coffee-inflected finish. The wine is dense, supple and extracted, with hints of spice, herb, lemon thyme and citrusy high tones.",,90,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Hightower
71314,US,"Dry, tannic and concentrated, a fierce, almost feral wine, but it's classic in the way of California mountain Zins.

Compelling and complex, it cries out for a rustic beef or pork dish, long simmered and well-seasoned.",,90,28.0,California,Rockpile,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hobo
71315,Austria,"A rare find in Austria, this shows the potential of Viognier. Flavors of apricot liqueur, summer flower aromas, and concentration come together to make a rich, powerful wine.

71316,US,"The fruit comes from Weinbau, DuBrul and Destiny Ridge. The Weinbau is old vine, and is the main component. This is a solid, meaty, deep purple and blue, with hints of smoked meat in the nose. Fruit flavors are tight, tart and run to the black cherry and blackberry flavors. Clearly varietal, with stiff tannins, a bit  chalky, but plenty of varietal character and a long finish with streaks of coffee and light herb.

71317,US,"The grapes got real ripe, to judge by the bright burst of yellow apricots and exotic passionfruits.

The wine finishes totally dry, leaving a palate impression of great elegance. Drink now through 2010.",Porter-Bass Vineyard,90,48.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Tandem
71318,US,"This is certainly a better Chard than the winery's '04. It's richer and more succulent, overall more rewarding in varietal fruit, including peaches and cream, pineapples, guavas and papayas, with a cinnamon spice finish.

71321,US,"Lots to like in this Cab Franc. Shows ripe, attractive cherry compote, black raspberry purée, cola, cocoa, coffee and spice flavors, with a rich, earthy edge of balsamic, sautéed mushroom and oaky vanilla.

71322,US,"Concentrated and showing a whiff of volatility, this is a blend of 62% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and a splash each of Cab Franc and Petit Verdot. Grapes are sourced from three different estate vineyards on Red Mountain. It's acidic and extracted, but opens up with exposure to air into a supple, rich, muscular, raspberry and cherry-flavored red blend. There are hints of rock, fennel and smoke, and a long, concentrated and well-rounded finish.",Three Vineyards,90,22.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Hedges
71323,US,"Dark, dense, ripe and oaky, this ramps up the oak flavors to higher levels, with rich layers of smoke, cedar, honey and butterscotch wrapped into the spicy, sweet fruit. As the wine ages and opens up the lovely cherry/cassis core fruit should come into the spotlight. Call it a Washington take on ripe, high-octane California reds.",Red Mountain,90,50.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Hightower
71324,Spain,"Sweet and welcoming; a good deal among pedigreed red wines. The nose on this 100% Monastrell from older vines is mammoth, toasty and dark, while the palate is chunky and virtually melts with blackberry, plum and cherry flavors. A real-deal red with breadth and class. 1,000 cases made.",,90,16.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Monastrell,Juan Gil
71325,US,"Here's a dry Chardonnay, notable for its firm structure. Acidity and oak tannins provide the framework for the candied Meyer lemon, mango, floral, mineral and buttered toast flavors. There's a touch of bitterness in the finish that suggests very modest aging. Drink now through 2008.",Quenneville Vineyard,90,35.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Byington
71326,Argentina,"Few Argentinean wineries are doing everyday red wines better than Chakana. A case in point is this excellent, superbly balanced, easy-drinking Cab. The nose is meaty, earthy and magnetic, while the palate is ripe, harmonious and full of cassis and raspberry. It's fruity more than complex, with stature and style.",,90,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chakana
71327,Argentina,"Color, power, flavor and commendable balance; that's pretty much the format for Punto Final, one of Argentina's go-to brands for Malbec. This youngster is ripe and ready, and it holds form onto a long finish. If it seems a little young and clumsy upon pouring, air it out and it'll improve.",Punto Final,90,11.0,Mendoza Province,Perdriel,,Malbec,Bodega Renacer
71328,US,"A classic Bordeaux blend (about 30% each Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot, the rest Petite Verdot) This wine is still locked up tight upon release. There is metallic minerality underpinning the tart, austere fruit, but there are also surprising high notes of brandied cherries, and a sense of depth missing in more ordinary wines. This is definitely a wine to cellar for up to a decade. As always, this is sensitive, detailed winemaking.",Ciel du Cheval,90,30.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Seven Hills
71329,US,"This is one of the riper of Siduri's crop of '05 single-vineyard Pinots. It bursts with cherry jam, sweet cola, vanilla and coffee fudge flavors that make it delicious, but it's no mere fruit bomb. The complex of acids, tannins and oak give it dimensions worth pondering. Best now and for five years.",Van der Kamp Vineyard,90,42.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
71330,US,"This doesn't disappoint. It's a Cabernet-based blend, with Merlot and Syrah. The '03 is lushly soft but dry and rich, with ripe, velvety tannins framing intense blackberry, coffee, tobacco and spice flavors. Should hit its stride by the end of 2007, and glide down for a couple of years after.",Alexis Red Wine,90,64.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Red Blend,Swanson
71331,Austria,"The steep terraced vineyard of the Sonnleiten, perfectly exposed, has produced a tense, vibrant Riesling, showing the mineral side of the grape, along with pink grapefruit and white currant flavors. It will age over many years.",Terrassen Sonnleiten,90,,Neusiedlersee-Hügelland,,,Riesling,R&A; Pfaffl
71332,US,"Easily the richest of Schug's current trio of Chards, showing the elegance and crispness of the other bottlings, but with more fruity intensity. It's still a fairly restrained wine, rich in acidity and dry minerality, but rewards with pineapple custard and butterscotch flavors.",Heritage Reserve,90,30.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Schug

71334,Germany,"A bit fuller and drier than you might expect from a Mosel Riesling, but there's no questioning this wine's excellent balance.

71335,US,"Califa is the winery's highest designation, kind of a reserve, and this Syrah is oakier and riper than the regular Chamisal bottling, although fully as dry. Marked with high, minty acidity and firm tannins. But there's huge red and black cherry fruit, courtesy of one of the hottest vintages in Edna Valley history. Elegant and intense, it's ready now.",Chamisal Vineyards Califa,89,42.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Domaine Alfred
71336,US,"A 50/50 Cab/Merlot blend from Pepper Bridge, this is quite tight and reductive but grudgingly opens out. It's a stiff, hard wine, layered with blueberry, raspberry and cassis, and annotated with baker's chocolate and anise. Dark and unyielding, it has the muscle and authority to age for another six or eight years. There's a hint of green tea in the chewy tannins.",Pepper Bridge,89,,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Hightower
71337,Spain,"This muscular youth proves that Priorat can deliver fleshy, modern wines. Or maybe it's the 20% Merlot that's softenening the Garnacha and Carignan. Either way, look for lush plum and black cherry flavors floating on a rich, heady palate. This is more Escalade or Range Rover than sports car.",,89,32.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Genium Celler
71338,Spain,"Very nice apple blossom and lightly stony aromas greet you, and the apple and apricot flavors are juicy and ripe.

71339,US,"Same vineyards as the '04, but a riper, deeper, denser vintage. This is good Washington merlot, with muscle, extract and plenty of stuffing. Flavors run to the dark side, blue/black fruits, mineral, licorice, smoke. It's got the kind of mass that will stand up to all meats, and the balance to age over the next decade or so. Nicely built, still tight and chewy.",,89,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Tamarack Cellars
71340,Spain,"Big and yellow, which is evidence of the oak aging on this plump, modern Verdejo that's made in small quantity and will appeal to those who like things such as Sémillon and Chenin Blanc. The body is full, there's fruit, weight and grip, and the ripeness versus minerality is just right. Drink now with cheese or fish. 300 cases produced.",Naiades,89,28.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Naia
71341,US,"The 2004, like so many Walla Walla wines, was sourced from a different mix of vineyards. In this case the grapes came from Cold Creek, Canoe Ridge, DuBrul and Artz – a very fine group indeed. There's no slip in quality here, just a bit of added richness and darker fruits than in the previous vintage. Blackberry purée laced with coffee liqueur dominates this open, accessible, and thoroughly enjoyable wine. Nicely balanced and showing its youthful freshness in a clean and softly seductive style.",,89,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Seven Hills
71342,Italy,"This is a very attractive wine with loads of personality and a long list of aromatic characteristics: Porcino mushroom, cedar, spice, licorice and scented candle.

71344,Australia,"Nicely integrated oak saturates the bouquet with suggestions of toast and spice without being overt, alongside custard and melon aromas.

Drink now.",,89,30.0,South Australia,Piccadilly Valley,,Chardonnay,Petaluma

71348,US,"Opens with pleasant aromas of cherry and raspberry purée, cola, Asian spice, vanilla and toasted marshmallow, then turns opulently fruity and dry in the mouth. It's not light-bodied, though; shows a weight of tannic density that suggests serious pairings, such as lamb and steak.",Estate,89,35.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Byington
71349,US,"It's scented with a pretty mix of sandalwood, toasted cracker and blackberry jam, and the flavors follow into tart berry and black cherry. There's noticeable acid and some interesting grace notes, suggestive of flint and gun metal. The flavors linger pleasantly in the back of the throat. This is not a fleshy merlot by any means, but it is polished and evocative, and I like the suggestions of rock and iron ore that it has captured with the black cherry fruit.",,89,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Ash Hollow
71350,US,"This firm, tannic merlot is a step up in concentration from the winery's regular bottling. It's ripe, focused and still a bit tight, with stacked layers of berry, plum and cassis. Winemaker Rob Griffin retains some of the natural herbaceousness of the grape, as a background nuance, adding flavor interest. Decant it well before drinking.",Reserve,89,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Barnard Griffin

71352,US,"A challenging wine, made all the more so because there's a beautiful entry and the wine has truly delicious aspects. It's softly complex and beguiling, with cherry custard, vanilla and smoky oak flavors, and shows real finesse. On the other hand, the short finish suggests it's not going anywhere, so drink up.",Estate,89,65.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lancaster
71353,Spain,"Dry, smoky and lightly fruity, this Pinot Noir-based Cava is about as good as it gets in the price range.

71354,Argentina,"Even if this full-bodied Cab starts with some eggy, pastry-like aromas, it soon finds its form.

71356,Italy,"From 50-year-old vines, here is a unique, sweet red wine bursting with aromas of blackberry, cherry, pine forest, licorice and a playful touch of espresso.

71357,Austria,"This is in the middle range from Hans Setzer's impressive collection of Grüner Veltliner. Fresh, but with good weight and intensity.

71358,US,"This is tight, leafy, tannic and young, but it nicely captures the Wahluke Slope AVA style, with tight edges, crisp acids, citrus rind nuances, and a polished mouthfeel. It seems to gather strength as it sits on the palate; and it will profit from more time in bottle.

71359,US,"Here at last are the flavors that have been missing from Ste. Michelle Cabs for some time. This is crisply structured, varietally spot-on Cabernet. The ripe—but not jammy—fruit flavors of blackberry and black plum are amplified with spicy cinnamon from aging in American oak.

71362,US,"I like Mike Scott's Sauv Blancs for their pungent, grassy aromas, and their piercingly tart acids.

71363,Germany,"Boasts classic Mosel Riesling aromas and flavors—lime, pineapple, green apple, maybe a touch of honey—all at an eminently reasonable price.

71364,Australia,"Starts with a hint of honey to go with Asian pear and dried spices, developing into a medium-bodied, round Riesling with strong apple, pear, spice and tangerine flavors.

71365,Australia,"This is a reasonably full-bodied, rounded example of Australian Riesling that smells of honey and peaches, but with a sense of underlying stony bedrock.

Good price, too.",Individual Vineyard Selection,89,16.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,,Riesling,Pewsey Vale
71366,US,"The blend is 40% Merlot, 36% Cab Sauvignon and 24% Cab Franc. Full and fleshy, with broad flavors of black cherry and blackberry. Though plenty ripe and round, the fruit is punctuated with some grainy, dusty, smoky tannins. It's a nice combination, the fruit opening up the wine and the tannins giving it authority.

71368,Argentina,"Mauricio Lorca makes wine for Enrique Foster but his private label is something to keep an eye on.

71374,Argentina,"In the past this was a Bordeaux blend but now it's all or almost all Malbec. And because it hails from cooler Tupungato it features floral aromas more than heavy berry scents, and in the mouth it's all about red fruit as opposed to beefy black fruit.

71375,Australia,"Perennially one of Western Australia's best Rieslings, this is a medium-bodied effort that's deceptively light on its feet for having 13.5% alcohol.

71379,US,"Dense, dry and young, this is a Syrah for the cellar. With 10% Petite Sirah, it has some fierce tannins, and is a little soft, but possesses the inherent balance to age.

71384,US,"Soft, herbal and showing a streak of sweet baking spice, this unusual red wine immediately sets itself apart from more ordinary Bordeaux blends. Slightly more than half Cabernet, a third Cab Franc and 10% Merlot, this definitely has the pedigreed vineyard fruit. The almost supernal softness of the wine suggests some sort of micro-oxidation, yet it remains sappy and tart. Flavors continue through a myriad of baking spices into a rich and extended finish. The only detriments: the acids are a bit chalky, and the finish lacks finesse.

71386,US,"High in acidity and bone dry, this light-colored Pinot seems a bit one-dimensional right now, but I think it was released too early.

If you have to drink it now, decant for several hours.",Sapphire Hill Vineyard,89,42.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
71387,US,"This is the fourth vintage for this rare Washington version of Petite Sirah, and the best yet.

71388,Spain,"If you don't mind some heavy barrel char, then you'll probably like this rough rider.

71398,US,"A very limited production wine from a new Walla Walla vineyard, this was barrel fermented in neutral oak and softened up with partial malo. It leans a bit more toward the citrus/pineapple flavor side than does the winery's regular Chardonnay bottling. This is a bit crisper, with subtle grassy highlights adding some lift and interest.",Birch Creek Vineyard,88,28.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Dusted Valley
71399,US,"A blast of SO2 quickly blows off after pulling the cork, revealing a lovely mix of fruit and a more authentic, varietal herbaceous character. Clean and detailed, with citrus, dried herbs and no new oak, it leaves you with a hint of flint and an urge to pour another glass.",,88,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Chateau Ste. Michelle
71400,US,"Roughly 140,000 cases were produced, making this (along with the Two Vines) the benchmark budget Merlot for the state, if not the country. These wines are given plenty of cellaring, which helps to soften them up. The style is wide open and flavorful, with broad cherry and berry fruit set against very smooth, chocolatey tannins. The Grand Estates has thicker, more substantial weight and a silky, milk chocolatey finish.",Grand Estates,88,11.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Columbia Crest
71401,Argentina,"Fast becoming one of Argentina's most reliable value brands, Altosur got it right in 2006 with its basic Malbec. The wine is full, chewy, healthy and bright. It has all the attributes of good, young Malbec: plums, berries and chocolate, with lushness and some style.",Altosur,88,11.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Finca Sophenia
71402,Argentina,"Starts out sort of soft and shy, with modest red-fruit aromas. In the mouth, raspberry and cherry flavors get a quick lift from grabby, firm tannins. And by the time this baby hits its groove you're onto a finish defined by a starchy feel and long-lasting Cabernet essence. Airing is this wine's best friend; decant or drink over time.",Luigi Bosca Reserva,88,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Luigi Bosca
71403,US,"This is the kind of PG that makes the variety such a perfect all-purpose white. It's bone dry, with a great crunch of acidity that brightens slightly herbal grapefruit zest, white peach, Meyer lemon and wildflower flavors. Interestingly, the wine did not undergo malolactic, and while it was fermented in stainless steel, it was sur lies aged.",,88,21.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Pinot Grigio,Swanson
71404,Austria,A relatively rare varietal that is believed to originate in the Krems region. This example shows the varietal's high acidity that needs an off-dry flavor to compensate. It has a nice caramel layer which helps in the balance.,Kreimelberg,88,21.0,Niederösterreich,,,Roter Veltliner,Setzer
71405,Italy,"A very characteristic wine of southern Italy, the nose delivers cherry, berry, tobacco, root beer, balsamic, red earth and linseed oil aromas. In fact, there's a lingering perfume reminiscent of paints in an artist's studio. The wine is elegant in the mouth with crisp acidity and a long finish.",,88,16.0,Southern Italy,Aglianico del Vulture,,Aglianico,Vigne di Mezzo
71406,Italy,"Vibrant fruit, red apple and blue flowers appear with intensity on the nose to create a racy, clean red wine. The acidity is good, as is the structure, but the 15% alcohol does hit the palate hard. Pair it with cream-based pasta (to counter the alcohol), white meat and roasted winter vegetables.",Schiaccianoci Riserva,88,18.0,Southern Italy,Salento,,Negroamaro,Vigne & Vini
71407,US,"Primitivo makes up three-fifths of the blend, Petite Sirah most of the rest. It's consistent with past vintages: dark, soft, and plummy. But in 2005 there was something special going on, and the decadently sweet black cherry fruit really sings here.",Dr. Wolfe's Family Red,88,15.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Red Blend,Thurston Wolfe
71408,US,"Really young now, this vineyard block bottling needs a little time to come into its own. Tasted in February, a combination of acidity and bottle shock has made it brittle. But it's a very good wine, deliciously flavored, with a medium-bodied silkiness and Pinot's exotic sensuality.",Lot 4 Selection,88,38.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Moshin
71409,Italy,"Crisp, fruity and full of mineral nuances, this faithfully represents Sardinia's winemaking potential, especially when it comes to easy-drinking white wines.

71412,US,"This is a deep gold, scented with cooked apple and pear, and showing some soft, oxidative character from extended barrel fermentation. It is quite accessible, soft and forward, with light hints of tropical fruits leading into a smooth, lightly toasty finish. Definitely a drink-now Chardonnay.",,88,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Dusted Valley
71413,US,"This is an excellent vintage in Washington, and Bob Bertheau has made a soft, smooth, well-crafted Sauvignon Blanc. Just a bit more than one-third was barrel fermented, and the blend is 100% varietal. It's a fruity, polished effort with citrusy highlights, but I'd love to see the winemaker veer a bit more towards a Washington State-style that includes some sweet grassiness in the finish.",Horse Heaven Vineyard,88,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Chateau Ste.

71415,US,"Lots of acidity in this crunchy wine; this is so tart it's almost like fresh-squeezed lime juice. Fortunately, creamy lees and plenty of new oak add softer, sweeter notes of buttered toast and vanilla.",Chamisal Vineyards,88,24.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Domaine Alfred
71416,Spain,"Plenty of intense new oak sets the nose in a direction toward mint, licorice and black pepper. And that's all good, because the palate backs it up  with prime blackberry and cassis flavors. This is a solid wine with slightly pronounced acids and tannins. Not for those averse to a little grab and kick.",Prios Maximus Crianza,88,26.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Bodegas de los Rios Prieto

71418,US,"For my money, this is the most authentic wine that Maryhill makes. It has not been softened, oaked, sweetened and vanilla'd up—it just shows the great fruit and the verticality of nicely ripened grapes. Composed of 40% Merlot, 32% Cabernet, 22% Syrah, 6% Cab Franc and 13.9% alcohol.",Winemaker's Blend,88,10.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Maryhill
71419,Italy,"A sophisticated and seductive expression of the Primitivo grape, this Antinori-made Puglian wine boasts thick concentration, fruity extracts, ripe cherry flavors, strawberry and a thick inky appearance. The tannins are rock solid suggesting a pairing with roasted meats, steak or aged cheeses.",Torcicoda,88,20.0,Southern Italy,Salento,,Primitivo,Tormaresca
71420,Australia,"Fits the Chardonnay image to a T, with descriptors like smoke, clove, cinnamon, apple and citrus all coming readily to mind.

71421,Spain,"Nicely balanced and a better example of the upside of Navarra than the wines that are based on or include Merlot. The nose shows some herbal character but more deep fruit notes. And in the mouth there's ripe cherry, cassis and plum. Texturally, it's very nice, and when you get down to the nuts and olts it's a very good value.",,88,11.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo,Vega Sindoa
71422,US,"This wine fits the winery style like a comfy old shoe. It feels good, smells good and wears well. There is a nod to the grassy quality of the grape, but it's smoothed over with toasty cracker flavors and thicker seams of fig, melon and pear.",,88,14.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Waterbrook
71423,Austria,"From the first vintage of Grüner Veltliner wines under the Weinviertel DAC, this offering from Hans Setzer is crisp, fresh and light, showing a little softness from age, but still full of vibrant white currants and pepper.",Ried Eichholz,88,,Weinviertel,,,Grüner Veltliner,Setzer
71424,US,"In 2003 the vineyard was going through some changes, and the vintage, the shift in focus and the winemaker's predilection for early picking seemed to conspire to produce a rather thin, austere wine. It's locked up tight, a bit herbal and lean, not yet revealing itself even with aeration. It's one of those mystery wines that you keep coming back to, waiting for the light to blink on.",Klipsun Vineyard,88,30.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Seven Hills
71425,France,"Ripe but minerally, all flint and crisp fruit along with the richness from the structure and green plum and wood flavors.

71427,Spain,"Carchelo is at its best in this vintage. This is loaded with wild blackberry and leathery sass, too.

71429,Argentina,"The bouquet is fairly tight, with aromas of coffee, crushed minerals, crude oil and fine herbs. The palate runs snappier than most high-end Malbecs, but it also delivers on the promise of ripeness and black-fruit flavors. Finishes in healthy fashion, with some slickness and speed. Very nice and likely even better with food. 1,000 cases made. Imported by Slocum & Sons.",Edicion Limitada,88,45.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
71430,US,"BFM stands for Blow Your Freakin' Mind, say the winemakers, whose marketing spin is to aggressively position their wines as ready to party. Nonetheless this four grape Bordeaux blend is priced to compete with serious and substantial wines from around the world, and in terms of flavor it does so competently. Though no Sangiovese is listed in the blend, it shows some of the high-acid and tobacco leaf qualities of that grape, and has a good mix of leafy herb, light red fruits, hints of leather and grippy acid throughout.",BFM,88,32.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Dusted Valley
71431,US,"Chardonnay is the sweet spot in the white wine lineup (along with Riesling, of course).

71432,US,"Shows the robust mouthfeel and high alcohol that Lodi Zins usually bring, with a concentration of Zinny essence that must be due to low yielding vines.

71434,Spain,"Toasty, yeasty and quite composed given the price point. If you like green apples, ripe pears or lychee fruit, chances are you're going to like this well-blended and fairly smooth Cava. It's persistent and structured enough to go with appetizers or main courses.",Brut Exclusive Reserva,88,13.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Marqués de Gelida
71435,US,"This opens with a very pretty nose composed of rose petals, pear, orange peel and orange liqueur.

A lovely springtime apéritif.",,88,19.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Viognier,Di Stefano
71436,US,"For the first time this popular blend contains no Yakima Valley fruit. The savvy blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah works like a charm. Outside of the Ste.

71438,US,"Exceptionally well-priced, this is the last to come from a vineyard block planted in the Yakima Valley in 1979.

Big, fruity and forward.",,88,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Riesling,Seven Hills
71439,US,"Scents of smoke, earth, citrus rind and a strong acidic foundation define this wine. It's a fine example of cooler-site Washington Syrah, with all the nuances that that brings to the wine.

71443,US,"Cheval and Champoux. Snappy and crisply defined, this sharp-edged wine opens with tight berry flavors, some chalky acids, and grainy, stony tannins. It shows less flesh than the other reds, more acid, and a stiffness to the tannins. After extensive airing the vanilla flavors come out, along with an interesting spice. The fruit is clean and ripe, and the balance, except possibly for the chalky acids, is right on.",Abbinare,88,27.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,:Nota Bene
71444,US,"Beautiful Sonoma Zin, sourced mainly from Alexander Valley. Although the winemaker had to struggle against shriveled, raisiny fruit, the wine shows a soft complexity.

71445,Argentina,"Here's a nice wine that pushes the right buttons while not raising any red flags. Raspberry and vanilla flavors are solid and pleasing, while the medium-weight palate features depth and balance.

71447,US,"This is a clear step up from the excellent Two Vines Shiraz, and worth the extra couple of bucks. Wild berry flavors and varietal spice are given a somewhat tannic, earthy frame. Flavors suggest graphite, moist soil and some textural, grainy tannins. It's substantial, not just simple and fruity, and offers a lot of depth for the price.",Grand Estates,88,11.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Shiraz,Columbia Crest
71448,Argentina,"Quite earthy and ripe, as tree bark, leather and prune make up the bouquet. The mouth is lively and snappy, with red fruit taking over and holding reign.

71451,Australia,"This full-bodied wine could use a touch more lushness in the midpalate to help carry its assertive flavors of blackberries and chocolate.

It's not an ager, but has a full-bodied richness that suggests steaks and chops.",Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard,88,34.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Dutton Estate
71478,France,"Toasty, with notes of slightly menthol-like oak layered over ripe blackberry fruit. It's a medium-bodied wine that finishes crisp, tart and mouthwatering. Give it another 6–12 months to better integrate the oak, then drink it over the next five or so years.",,87,16.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec-Merlot,Croix du Mayne
71479,US,"Simple, off-dry, and very much in the style of the Riesling. The blend includes 9% Muscat Canelli. It's basically a fruity, somewhat sweet tasting room wine.",,87,10.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Gewürztraminer,Chateau Ste. Michelle
71480,US,"The sources of this Syrah are all very good, including top vineyards from Santa Barbara, Arroyo Seco, Alexander Valley and Lake County.

71481,France,"Full-bodied and ripe, with cool green fruits topping some rich vanilla, cream and white currant flavors. It's certainly very fruity, but there's an extra dimension of a youthful structure that needs another year to develop fully.",Domaine du Vaudon,87,23.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Joseph Drouhin
71482,France,"Produced from a Brotte-owned property, this Châteauneuf is a deliberate counterpoint to the Père Anselme bottling. It sees some new oak, giving it a slightly toasty character to go with dried cherries, prune and baking spices. Firm on the finish; try after 2008.",Domaine Barville,87,40.0,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Brotte
71483,US,"From the Maury Balcom vineyard, this is a dry, fruit-forward rosé, finished at a pleasing 12.4% alcohol. It's a forward, fruity, lightly spicy springtime quaffer, packed with strawberry flavor.

71485,Argentina,"Full and inviting up front, with hickory and leather in addition to dark-fruit aromas. This is a collaboration between two Italian buddies and the wine features black cherry and plum flavors but also rather grabby, heavy tannins. It's ultimately chewy and a bit hard, but still it's eminently satisfying.",Prodigo Reserva,87,30.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alessandro Speri
71486,US,"Alderbrook is one of those insider wineries that does a good job at a fair price.

71487,US,"This is so big, it's almost Rhône-like. With its full-bodied richness, tannins and voluminous cherry, currant and leather flavors, you might think it was Grenache. Not varietally correct, but still a tasty wine.",Las Brisas Vineyard,87,40.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
71488,Argentina,"Still not sure what the difference is between Sur de los Andes and Alma de los Andes (they're from the same winery), but this wine seems a tiny bit more open and friendly than the Alma. It's evolved, sweet and full of blackberry and blueberry flavors. And the finish carries some warm baked notes that anchor the deal.",,87,9.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Sur de los Andes
71489,US,"There's no other blend of Carignan, Pinot Noir, Gewürz, Syrah and several other varieties, so far as I know. The wine is dry, with crisp acidity and deep cherry and raspberry flavors. It's not complicated, but it's fun.",Peloton Red Wine,87,25.0,California,California,California Other,Red Blend,Tandem
71490,US,"Softly gentle, this wine is easy to like for its wealth of pie filling blackberries, cherries, blueberries and milk chocolate.

71494,US,"Plummy and ripe, this tannic, herbal take on Zinfandel is ready for near-term drinking.

The alcohol is a moderate 14.5%.",Howling Wolfe,87,18.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Zinfandel,Thurston Wolfe
71495,US,"A controversial wine. On the plus side are dryness and silky elegance, courtesy of finely ground tannins and crisp acidity, while the cherry and earthy tobacco and truffle flavors are restrained and complex. But then there's the price, which seems excessive. You decide.",Poggio Alla Pietra Brunello di Sonoma,87,60.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Petroni
71496,Australia,"Smells ripe, with scents of honey, baked apples and spice, but also a refreshing lime zest top note.

Imported by USA Wine West.",Watervale,87,25.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Riesling,Mount Horrocks
71497,Australia,"For an unwooded Chardonnay, this is unusually plump and pillowy in texture, with layers of tropical fruit given shape on the finish by a squirt of citrus. A hint of spice adds extra nuance to this crowd-pleasing wine.",Unwooded,87,12.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Chardonnay,Razor's Edge
71498,US,"Nice and smooth, this Cab hits the palate with a plush tannic structure and oak-infused cassis and red cherry flavors.

71499,Italy,"Here's a wine that faithfully reflects the personality of its origin: Prune, black fruit, plump cherry, leather, coffee, Mediterranean herb  and exotic spice are all components of an intense and intriguing nose. In the mouth, this wine offers sweet berry flavors, spice and dusty tannins.",Cantalupi,87,11.0,Southern Italy,Salento,,Primitivo,Conti Zecca
71500,US,"Here is another gem from the Two Vines lineup. Clean, fresh-tasting, varietal flavors show grapefruit and melon front and center.

The wine retains its herbaceous, penetrating, vivacious character.",Two Vines,87,8.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Columbia Crest
71501,Spain,"There's not much difference between this wine and the label's less expensive Brandal. This is a bit richer, with chunky melon aromas and peach melba flavors.

71503,US,"This wine is sourced from Lafayette, a bedroom community of San Francisco, and you know what? It's pretty good.

I'm looking forward to tasting the '05.",Ward Vineyard,87,20.0,California,Contra Costa County,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Tassajara
71504,Italy,"Thanks to a thick, purple-hued appearance you know you're in for a ripe and concentrated wine with thick layers of sweet red fruit aromas. The fruit is in fact very forthcoming but is also rendered more complex by background notes of graphite and chestnut. It's a youthful wine with a bright future.",Tenuta Rocca dei Leoni,87,20.0,Southern Italy,Aglianico del Beneventano,,Aglianico,Villa Matilde

In the mouth it is smooth and velvety with a medium-long finish.",,87,18.0,Southern Italy,Primitivo di Manduria,,Primitivo,Ognissole
71506,US,"Shows rich, racy acidity in a dry wine whose flavors veer toward ripe pineapple-tart filling, cinnamon spice and butterscotch, wrapped in a creamy texture. Would score far higher if the fruit were more concentrated.",,87,20.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Schug
71507,US,"The best of Schug's three current Pinots, a blend of several vineyards throughout the appellation.

Drink this polished wine now.",,87,24.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Schug
71508,Australia,"Although a very good wine, this is a bit disappointing coming from winemaker Ben Glaetzer.

Finishes fresh, with tart berry flavors.",Jester,87,20.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Mitolo
71509,Spain,"A little weighty, with ripe apple and peach aromas. Fairly succulent in the mouth, with apple and citrus flavors that are both sweet and a touch chewy.

71510,Italy,"You'll pick up an attractive smoked ham-like quality on the nose backed by blueberry, blackberry, lead pencil, crushed black pepper and licorice. The intensity is not huge, nor is the length, but it would make an excellent match to grilled meats and aged goat cheeses.

71511,US,"This is a solid example of straight-ahead Washington merlot.

71512,Spain,"In 2005 this winery got a great harvest, and it's evident in this ripe, clean Garnacha that hits with jammy aromas and a ton of fresh-fruit flavors.

71516,US,"Though perhaps just a notch below the 2002 version, this remains the Merlot to beat in the budget bottle sweepstakes. Bright berry fruit is married to smooth chocolate, without appearing over-manipulated or laced with fake vanilla. Creamy and consistent, it's widely available at a great price. Over 172,000 cases were produced.",Two Vines,87,8.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Columbia Crest
71517,Italy,"You'd expect this southern Italian wine to be on the extraripe side, but instead it offers a nice balance of green notes including herbs, eucalyptus, licorice, carob, vanilla and delicate forest berry. It's an easy drink with noticeable but not overpowering tannins and medium consistency.",Cantalupi,87,10.0,Southern Italy,Salento,,Negroamaro,Conti Zecca
71518,Spain,"Heat from the 2003 vintage aside, this is one sweet, forward, dark-colored Cava. The nose is all about cheeky, sweet fruit, while the palate offers more berry sweetness along with vanilla. Normally this bottling is more restrained and striated, but 2003 was a warm year. May be better with desserts than appetizers, given the ripeness.",Rosé Brut Reserva,87,18.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Llopart
71519,US,"Maryhill, frustrating as many of their wines may be, does well by their Cabernets. This is not in the same class as the exceptional 2003, but offers ripe red fruits highlighted with smooth tannins and traces of black tea wrapped around black cherry and blackberry fruit. Ultimately, it falls into the same soft sweet red category as the winery's other wines, but with a bit more definition, snap and style.",Proprietor's Reserve,87,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Maryhill
71520,Spain,"Nothing wrong with this pleasant, friendly Cava. The nose boasts frosted breakfast cereal and lemon curd, while the palate is defined by spiced apple and baked citrus. It gets more honeyed and fat as it opens, although a good chilling will keep that in check.",Masia Parera Brut,87,11.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Sparkling Blend,Giró Ribot
71521,Spain,"Nice and fruity, with a touch of spice to the nose. The palate is plump and dark, with nothing besides all-natural fruit. A hearty and healthy wine that boasts freshness and purity but no oak.",,87,12.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Gotin
71522,Austria,"This cross between Traminer and Roter Veltliner is found mainly in the Thermenregion in Austria. This example is rich and perfumed, with some hint of lychees but low acidity. Wood aging does little for it. Screwcap.",Reserve,87,,Thermenregion,,,Rotgipfler,Johanneshof Reinisch

71526,Argentina,"Sauvignon Blanc is far from being Argentina's signature grape, so the fact that this one from San Juan province is legitimate, crisp and varietally correct is impressive. Beyond that, the wine delivers true lime, passion fruit and citrus aromas and flavors. Fresh and easy to like.",,87,9.0,Other,San Juan,,Sauvignon Blanc,Las Moras
71527,US,"A mix of fruit that survived the big freeze, from Dwelley, Morrison Lane and Minnick vineyards. It's tight, tart and tannic, and showing some pickle barrel notes from time in new American oak. Herbal and compact, this is a wine that should probably be given another year or so in the bottle to smooth itself out.",,87,25.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Seven Hills
71528,Germany,"Fragrant and slightly floral or herbal, but there's also an intriguing mineral-smoke note that adds dimension to the aromas. It's light to medium-bodied, with apple, mint and lime flavors complementing a dry, stony minerality. Drink now.",P2,87,12.0,Nahe,,,Riesling,Two Princes
71529,Spain,"Fairly bold and ripe up front, with dark berry aromas and an almond candy undercurrent. The palate is a bit more red-fruit based than the bouquet, and the flavors of raspberry and red plums are satisfying a touch tangy. Interesting, with drying tannins on the finish.",,87,18.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Val Montium
71530,Italy,"An attractively priced Primitivo-Aglianico blend that delivers a surprisingly delicate aromatic ensemble of forest berry, marzipan aromas. Firm tannins do need to unwind though. Pair with lamb, roasted pork or aged cheeses.",Tatu,87,12.0,Southern Italy,Primitivo del Tarantino,,Primitivo,Vigne & Vini
71531,US,"I really liked the winery's 2003 Cab Franc, for its dark, black fruits laced with licorice and streaks of tarry tannin. What's missing here is that defining structure; they've slipped this one into the soft, smooth, generic red category. Sweet fruit, some smoke and a bit more stiffness to the tannins still make this wine a relative standout, but it's lost its edge.",Proprietor's Reserve,87,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Franc,Maryhill

71533,US,"This is the first Viognier from Lost Canyon I've had, and it's very good.

Marked by intense tropical fruit, wildflower, vanilla and spice flavors.",Catie's Corner Vineyard,87,25.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Lost Canyon
71534,Australia,"A blend of 68% Pinot Noir and 32% Chardonnay, this is one of the lighter-bodied Australian sparklers, featuring fruit-forward aromas of pineapple, vanilla and coconut. Flavors of citrus and toast are more standard fare; the wine finishes with good length, suggesting a few years of cellaring will do it no harm.",Croser Pinot Noir-Chardonnay,87,30.0,South Australia,Piccadilly Valley,,Champagne Blend,Petaluma
71535,Argentina,"If you've never tried Argentine Bonarda, Chakana is a good place to start. The nose offers the varietal's typical vulcanized rubber and dark-fruit aromas, while the palate is smooth and full of straightforward blackberry. Complicated it's not, but it is pleasant.",,87,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Chakana
71536,France,"From a small Chablis producer, this is very soft, showing some ripe fruit but an amorphous structure; rather unfocused. There are plenty of creamy wood and sweet green-fruit flavors, but they need time to hang together better.",Fourchaume Premier Cru,87,,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Domaine de Vrignaud
71537,US,"They've upped the price, but Covey still makes the best under-$10 Pinot Grigio in the land. Prickly acids prop up moderately ripe flavors of stone fruits, pear, pineapple and green apple. This has punch and grip, and the persistent, palate-refreshing tartness takes away any undue sweetness.",Quail Series,87,9.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Pinot Grigio,Covey Run
71538,Spain,"Classic in every sense, from the early aromas of dill butter to the dry, acid-driven palate to the light, crisp finish. In a world where so many wines are going ripe and heavy, this one holds steady to the traditional. So if you're looking for an old-school Spanish red to go with tortilla espanola or lamb chops, this will do the trick.",Old Vines Reserva,87,17.0,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
71539,Hungary,"Soft and integrated aromas and taut flavors of blackberry, blackcurrant and smoke give this French-style wine class and poise. Its dry, clean quality, good structure and flavorful fruit means it will age well, but drink now and you will not be disappointed. Another thumbs up for Hungarian winemaking.",Barrique,87,29.0,Villány,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gere Attila

71541,Argentina,"Dark to the eye and nose, with aromas of rubber, black fruit and lots of sharp-edged oak. Wood more than fruit controls the front of the palate and the finish, but inbetween the folds you'll find plump berry and black pepper flavors. A nice Malbec but arguably a little heavy on the oak.",Famiglia Bianchi,87,18.0,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,Valentin Bianchi
71542,US,"Big, bold and a little obvious, this Chard's main feature is oak, and plenty of it. Smoky and charry, the wine also has big fruit, along the lines of apricot jam, peach cobbler and pineapples. Don't drink it too cold.",Reserve,87,55.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,ZD
71543,Austria,"The Kraxn (pronounced “KRAX-en”) is well-placed for Riesling, with its southern exposure close to the Danube river. The richness of the fruit shows through in this soft, open, opulent wine, with its pepper and white fruit flavors.",Kremser Kraxn,87,20.0,Kremstal,,,Riesling,Zimmermann
71544,Argentina,"This reserve-level Chardonnay isn't that expensive yet it shows considerably more balance and complexity than the winery's regular Chard. This version offers peach and other stone-fruit aromas, while the palate presents smooth white fruit and toast flavors. Fairly long, with a healthy feel throughout.",Reserva,87,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Santa Julia
71545,US,"Shows lots to like with its dry crispness and fruity flavors, and with only 12.7% alcohol, the light, delicate mouthfeel is a pleasure.

71549,Spain,"Light and floral on the nose, and medium in intensity and acidity. Flavors of apple, green melon and citrus are clean and crisp, and overall the wine is a model of freshness. Drink it sooner rather than later; it's a touch on the soft side.",Casamaro,87,10.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Garciarévalo
71550,Australia,"A solid, well-made offering, Grant Burge's unoaked Chardonnay offers a medium-bodied mouthful of authoritative flavor at a reasonable price.

Drink now.",Barossa Wines Unoaked,87,14.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Chardonnay,Grant Burge
71551,Italy,"This is a raw and nervous Aglianico with firm tannins and finely etched mineral tones spread over red fruit nuances and toast. The nose offers blackberry, pomegranate and ash. It begs for a pairing with stewed game meat or crunchy roasted lamb.",A,87,16.0,Southern Italy,Irpinia,,Aglianico,Di Meo
71552,US,"This is 96% Cabernet Franc, and why the winery doesn't just call a spade a spade is beyond me. But that quibble aside, there is much to recommend here. The fruit is plenty ripe and tastes of strawberry, raspberry and cherry preserves. The oak flavors bring on the smoke and toast, and the natural tendency of Cab Franc to impart green coffee bean notes is also much in evidence. The tannins have been softened up, but still leave a lingering green tea impression in the back of the throat.",Sogno,87,36.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Di Stefano
71553,US,"I've always enjoyed this bottling for its exuberant white pepper opening and dry, tannic structure, and the '04 continues that tradition.

71555,US,"This follows along the same track as the 2003—moderately ripe with lightly herbal fruit mixing plum, blueberry and cherry.

71556,US,"Destiny Ridge vineyard, in the Horse Heaven Hills, is one of Washington's most prolific and important new growers.

71560,US,"Already in the bottle, this is set for a September release. Right now, it's a bit ruggedly tannic, although the flavors are spot on.

71566,Argentina,"Like most of Alma's wines, this Bonarda is smooth, fruity and approachable.

71569,Spain,"No doubt this wine possesses peppery, herbal qualities. But before it's dismissed as green we'd like to note that there's also a nice savory side to it.

71580,US,"A dry, somewhat metallic, austere mouthfeel marks the entrance of this Cabernet. It has an Old World touch of musty dryness throughout, and the black cherry fruit seems to be drying out already. Flavors are succinct and contained.

71622,US,"This is dark and slightly murky, with sweet scents of cooked fruits and baking spices. Somehow it keeps the alcohol levels well down (13%) but the fruit flavors are ultra-ripe, pruney, and deep.

71649,Argentina,"For an average vintage this is an average wine. It has some bramble, leather and mild green notes to the nose, which are backed by red-fruit and brambly flavors. The feel is fresh and racy due to firm acids. Not the most expressive wine going, but nobody is going to call it flat or flabby.",Laborum Limited Edition,85,49.0,Other,Cafayate,,Malbec,Bodegas El Por Venir de los Andes
71650,Spain,"There's more than enough to like about this red-fruit driven middleweight.

71652,US,"A little sweet and high in alcohol for my taste, this wine, which winemaker Greg La Follette calls “a fruit riot,” indeed is explosive. Cherries, blueberries and black raspberries run rampant, with overtones of milk chocolate and coffee. On the plus side are rich, dusty tannins and good acidity, which lend structure.",Talmage Bench Aldine Vineyard,85,32.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Zinfandel,Tandem
71653,Italy,"This is a distinctly uncommon wine with delicate nuances of pressed flowers, violets, leather, spice, nutmeg and licorice that sees no wood. High heat (and a whopping 17% alcohol) does not disturb as much as you'd think, although there is a disjointed spicy, peppery hot sensation on the palate.",Badde Nigolosu,85,80.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Romangia,,Cannonau,Tenute Dettori

71655,Argentina,"Young and sturdy, with pear and apple aromas enveloped in popcorn and wood. The palate offers standard New World weight and sweetness along with flavors of pear, vanilla and oak. More on the full-bodied, oaky side, but generally it's balanced and approachable.",Reserva,85,9.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Nieto Senetiner
71656,Argentina,"A little damp and heavy, with molasses, stewed berry and char on the nose. The palate, however, is fairly jumpy and alert; fiery berry flavors hit with force and some heat. On the finish you'll find berry essence and some bramble. Is it slightly green at its core? We think so. Imported by Southern Wine Group.",Terruño Lunlunta,85,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
71657,US,"This is already quite soft, oxidized and mature. It's a pleasant take on Sangiovese, absolutely ready to drink and approachable with warm, raisiny fruit flavors. There's a soft, chocolaty landing that keeps the tannins easy also. But there's not much character and no real stuffing here.",,85,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sangiovese,Maryhill
71658,Italy,"True to form for the Piedirosso grape, this is redolent of raspberries, sandalwood, lavender, volcanic soils and soapy-scented tones.

Drink now.",La Fiole du Pape,85,30.0,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Père Anselme
71663,Argentina,"Simple but nice in its class. The nose offers bulky but clean fruit and a touch of saddle, while the palate is ample, fruity and round. It flairs out on the finish but keeps rolling in the right direction. Good for the price.",,85,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Novus
71664,Italy,"Some occasions call for a simple, genuine wine and this Sardinian red made with the Bovale grape fits the bill just fine. Aromas include red fruit, berries, vanilla, cedar and toast. In the mouth, it imparts a succulent, creamy feel and good length.",Essentija,85,45.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Isola dei Nuraghi,,Bovale,Pala
71665,Australia,"This medium-bodied Riesling may have just a touch of residual sugar to help bulk it up, but it stays true to the variety's floral, spice-scented nature.

71666,Argentina,"Getting pricey as Argentine Chard goes, this moderately rich wine has true aromas and flavors, meaning there's some apple, pear and butter to sniff and vanilla-tinged peach and melon to taste. Not as complex or complicated as maybe it should be, but easy to like.",Reserva,85,16.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Terrazas de Los Andes
71667,Italy,"If you like wines marked by fragrant, incense-like perfumes, this is a bottle for you. Indian spice, clove, red rose, ginger and sandalwood  surround a core of brandied cherries. It's a corpulent wine that slides easily across the palate.",,85,8.0,Southern Italy,Salento,,Negroamaro,La Pisara

71669,US,"This is a solid effort in a very difficult vintage. A freeze took out a lot of Washington grapevines in 2004, and it probably impacted the quality of the fruit available for this budget blend. The 2004 carries far more of the green bean and herbal qualities than recent vintages, but the tannins are softened and for the price it seems honest and well-made.",Two Vines,85,8.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Columbia Crest

71677,Japan,"What a fun and intriguing discovery is to be found in the unfiltered version of this Japanese variety. Mouthwatering aromas of grapefruit and apple are followed by sweet but balanced grapefruit and citrus flavors.  Interestingly, the flavors are fresh but the mouthfeel creamy.  The finish is light.

71680,Argentina,"The wood is a bit forced, and overall this wine has a heavy, full-fruited personality.

A bit tannic and not all that varietal.",Reserva,85,9.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Nieto Senetiner
71681,Spain,"Bring on the funk, at least at first. This new-to-America wine gets out of the gate with wild leather, stable and bramble aromas, and there's always an aggressive, untamed quality to it. But with air it settles, and eventually true Tempranillo flavors emerge. More challenging than it should be.",Spiga,85,30.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
71682,US,"Good everyday Pinot, showing the racy acidity and silk-and-taffeta mouthfeel of the appellation and vintage. Bone dry and a little thin in cherry fruit, its tartness calls for food. Ahi tuna tartare will be nice.",,85,35.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Orogeny

71685,US,"The wine is mostly from a place called Tehama Foothills, which is a Sierra Mountain region about which little is known, wine-wise. It has a drop of Viognier and 30% new oak.

71743,US,"Soft and superripe, this Cab has jammy berry flavors, with an edge of green tannins. It's totally dry, and doesn't seem to have a future, so drink up.",Estate,84,50.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sunstone
71744,Argentina,"Good but sort of generic. The nose exudes strawberry and milk chocolate, and the palate features blueberry fruit and some citrus-like acidity. The mouthfeel is a bit raw and tangy, but overall it is clean and presents itself well.",Reserve,84,13.0,Mendoza Province,Alto Valle de Uco,,Syrah,Novus
71745,Germany,"Simple but fresh and appealing, this offering—made in conjunction with Washington State's Chateau Ste. Michelle—is a light, entry-level Ries ling filled with green apple and citrus flavors. Drink now.",,84,12.0,Pfalz,,,Riesling,Saint M

71749,US,"With Malbec so popular these days, I guess Chalk Hill decided to weigh in. The wine is inky black and bone dry,  earthy, supertannic and not very interesting. It's also seriously overpriced.",Chairman's Club,83,85.0,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Malbec,Chalk Hill
71750,Argentina,"Fading fast; this plump, hot-climate Chard is pretty much as expected: there's lots of oak covering peach, butterscotch and apple cider aromas and flavors. Borderline cloying.",Estate,83,16.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Chardonnay,Doña Paula
71751,Australia,"A step up from the Jacob's Creek NV Brut Cuvée, this sparkler comes across as soft and fruity, with abundant apple, melon and citrus flavors that finish clean, if somewhat lacking for crispness and length. Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.",Reserve Chardonnay-Pinot Noir,83,12.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Champagne Blend,Jacob's Creek
71752,Spain,"Quite heavy; in fact, a touch too much. The nose is defined by corn and apple cider, while the palate is heavy and melony, with a lot of unbounded sweetness and softness. Needs more overt acidity and citrus to achieve proper balance.",,83,11.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Aldor
71753,Argentina,"Fairly sweet on the nose, with plum and a touch of spice. Things get more rugged in the mouth, where cherry and blackberry flavors carry a medicinal edge. A big Syrah but also a clumsy, heavy-handed one. Proceed with caution.",Reserva,83,15.0,Other,Famatina Valley,,Syrah,La Puerta
71754,Argentina,"Some dry oak and smoke frames simple earth and berry aromas, but the mouth is condensed and flat. There isn't much bounce to this overripe red; it's heavy and seems to have caught a lot of sun in the vineyard.",,83,9.0,Other,San Juan,,Malbec,Las Moras
71755,Argentina,"Novus' basic Cab is probably a better wine for the money. This one seems to want to justify its reserve status by offering more oak. But that oak carries that creamy vanilla and carob flavor, making the wine sticky. And maybe the raw material is a bit overripe as well.",Reserve,83,15.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Novus
71756,Argentina,"Intense on the nose and colorful, but in the end this wine shows little character, complexity or style.

And it's almost sassy and tangy on the palate and finish.",Finca Los Lirios de los Andes,83,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Faustina
71757,Argentina,"Not sure exactly what's happening at Bianchi in San Rafael. A few years back Bianchi's wines were almost all exemplary but lately they've been all over the map.

71759,Spain,"Interesting in that this fresh, snappy table wine includes 60% Airen (a white grape) in addition to Tempranillo.

71760,US,"A difficult wine made problematic by the vintage. The cherry fruit tastes overtly sweet, and I suspect there's some residual sugar, the tradeoff for keeping alcohol moderate. Most unfortunate, because everything else works.",Rochioli Vineyard,83,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Castalia
71761,Argentina,"Light and spicy, with snappy, lean flavors of cherry and cranberry. This is more tart and underwhelming than most Malbec fans probably want, but it's not bad if you crave a lip-smacking red with zest.",Cava Negra,83,8.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Familia Barberis
71762,Spain,"Rather dilute and basic, with a touch of buttercup to the sweet, mellow nose.

Simple but fine; drink immediately.",Vega Esteban Blanco,83,8.0,Central Spain,Ribera del Guadiana,,Viura,Bodegas Ventura De Vega

71767,Hungary,"The price is a bit steep for this attractive Bordeaux blend from Hungary, but it does deliver on many levels. Sppealing pepper and mocha on the nose, and a balanced blend of pepper, spice and fruit on the palate, will satisfy versatile palates. It feels slightly tired, but the overall structure is good and the finish lingers.",Bock Cuvée Barrique,83,52.0,Villány,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Bock
71768,US,"Just beyond rose in the color department, this dry wine's chief problem is high and palate-searing acidity. It also finishes on the sweet side.",,83,15.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Nebbiolo,Martin & Weyrich

71770,Argentina,"All in all this isn't a bad little wine for the price. It is a touch musky and heavy on the nose, but the palate holds form as it delivers round banana and melon flavors along with some vanilla and sponge cake on the finish.",,83,6.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Funky Llama
71771,Argentina,"A bit heavy and bitter, but otherwise this is pretty decent. Not much can be said about the mild nose: it's typical but not that expressive. The palate, meanwhile, has a lot of weight and peach-pit bitterness, while the finish is a bit sluggish.",,83,9.0,Other,Famatina Valley,,Torrontés,La Puerta
71772,Spain,"In no way is this up to the high standards of other Tirants. The 2003 is overly woody and shy on the rich, saturated fruit that it's supposed to deliver. It's O.K., but very leafy, dry and tight.",Tirant,83,87.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Rotllan Torra
71773,US,"There's a big, orange question mark on the front label—that's all there is—so it's easy to recognize this Cabernet and Syrah blend on the shelf.

71779,Spain,"First, second and third nosings all result in the same finding: that this Cava smells a lot like lettuce.

72018,US,"The blend of these four Rhône white grapes—47% Grenache Blanc, 32% Marsanne, 16% Roussanne, 5% Picpoul—outshines their individual bottlings. Some sort of magic accrues. The Sirocco is supple, creamy and packed with aromas and flavors of citrus blossom, flesh and rind. It's got a peaches-and-cream mouthfeel, and a lick of butterscotch in the lush finish.",Boushey Vineyard Sirocco Blanc,92,25.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Rhône-style White Blend,McCrea Cellars
72019,US,"Quite a good Cabernet, pure and intense in varietal characteristics of black currants, but balanced and elegant. The tannins are smooth, the finish complex and long in spices.

72020,US,"This new vintage is sourced from a single block from the Dineen vineyard, and aged in 50% new French oak—the most ever. Black fruits abound, along with licorice, tar and a whiff of iodine.

72021,US,"Shows the usual Williams Selyem Chardonnay profile of huge fruit and flashy oak. This opulent wine would be over-the-top except that it's balanced by crisp, lemony acidity, and somehow retains a tight core with a gravitational tug that keeps the richness focused.

72022,US,"This proprietary bottling from Shafer is always a huge wine. The 2010, which contains a splash of Petite Verdot, is gigantically packed with blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and sweet oak, courtesy of 20 months in 100% new French oak barrels.

72025,US,"As usual, this is one of Calera's lightest bottlings, in both color and texture.

72655,US,"A liquid tribute to old Mendocino, this wine is a blend of mostly Zinfandel and Petite Sirah, with smaller proportions of Sangiovese, Carignane, Negromaro, Barbera, Nebbiolo and Syrah. Medium bodied with spicy black pepper, leather and stewed plum flavors, it would go perfectly well with burgers or pizza.",Primo Rosso,86,9.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Red Blend,Monte Volpe

72657,Spain,"Apple, lime, lemon and natural vanilla are the aromas one gets from this blended Catalonian white.

Drink immediately.",Sangre de Toro Viña Sol,86,12.0,Catalonia,Catalunya,,White Blend,Torres
72658,Spain,"There's plenty of berry fruit on the nose of this Ribera red. The palate feels fresh and acidic, with a mild streak of softer, buttery oak. Flavors of crisp plum and cassis are sharpened by said acidity yet smoothed out by oaky vanilla on the finish.",Vendimia Seleccionada,86,,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Viña Gormaz
72659,US,"A very lightly aromatic offering of Riesling with notes of jasmine, nectarine and honey.

72662,US,"The alcohol on this bottling is lower than most Fe Ciegas have been in the past, reflecting the cool vintage. The wine seems more austere than in the past, withholding a bit of the early appeal it used to show. Nonetheless, it's wonderfully structured in acids and tannins and very dry, with a judicious application of oak, and there are intricate flavors of cherries, red currants and herbs. Seems like it could shine with age, so give it six years in the cellar.",Fe Ciega Vineyard,92,48.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Longoria

72672,US,"Concentrated and elusively complex in cherry, red currant and sandalwood flavors, with a hint of red tomato and bloody red meat that testifies to the cool vintage.

72675,Austria,"A blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sämling, this gold straw colored wine is about freshness and acidity as much as about sweetness.

72676,Spain,"This is a ripe, dark but balanced Toro with pastry, prune, blackberry and vanilla aromas. The palate is fiercely tannic on the surface but not overly hard at the foundation.

72680,US,"A big, rich, vital Cabernet with immediate attraction that is deceptive. Sure, you can enjoy it now, while it's brimming in cherry jam and red and black currants with a finish of rich, caramelized oak.

This is Round Pond's best estate Cabernet in years.",Estate,92,50.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Round Pond

72694,US,"It's interesting and a little odd that this 100% Sauvignon Blanc, from Mondavi's heralded To Kalon's great I Block, already is showing signs of maturity, although it's only about three years old. The reserve To Kalon, released more than a year ago, was fresh and fruity. This wine by contrast is beginning to show mushroom, herb and mineral complexities alongside the citrus fruits.

72698,US,"This Cab is in a somewhat awkward state now, poised between fresh blackberry and cherry fruit and mature notes of dried fruits and mushrooms. That tension lends it interest.

73525,Spain,"Gramona is known for yeasty, complex sparklers, and this falls into that paradigm. The nose is definitely yeasty, with apple and green melon aromas. It's a bit soft for Cava, but that's because it's an '05 that rested on lees for years.

73540,Chile,"Given that 2009 was a hot vintage in Chile, it's not shocking that this old vine Cabernet is rich, ripe and syrupy. The nose is attractive and offers aromas of blackberry, tree bark, herbs and minerality. The palate deals gritty tannins and rich, raisiny flavors of cassis, blackberry, coffee and toast.

73543,France,"It must be unique to find any Bordeaux in a Burgundy style bottle. Certainly this ultra-rich wine owes much to Burgundian Chardonnay.

Tart pomegranate fruit, streaks of stem and cement, mint and spice, all rise briefly and then fall away. It's a detailed wine, in the enigmatic style that marks this tiny winery as sui generis. Among the lineup of reds from 2010, it's best of show at the moment.",,90,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Dolcetto,Animale

Densely packed in fruit, it explodes in blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, minerals and sweet, toasty new oak. That richness is lifted to brilliance by the tannic structure, which is world class.

74394,France,"This is a firm and tough wine initially, but it slowly opens and develops a rich character through its wood-aged and licorice flavors and fragrant acidity.

One of the best Cabernet Francs from the Russian River Valley in a long time.",,90,28.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Bailiwick
74400,US,"This rich wine is a great success. It's enormously rich, almost flamboyant in blackberry jam, blueberry cobbler, anise and smoky new oak, as delicious as any Cabernet out there.

74404,US,"A vastly concentrated Cabernet. Frazier seems to have taken their basic Cabernet, which is an excellent wine, and intensified everything about it. With explosive blackberry, cassis, blueberry, dark chocolate and oak flavors, it's almost too much of a good thing. Your best bet is to cellar it, but that's chancy. The alcohol is very high, and we do not know how these modern Cabernets will ride out the years.",Memento,94,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frazier
74405,US,"So rich and ripe in fruit, you almost don't notice that it's also a complicated and layered wine in structure.

74414,US,"A huge wine, almost old-fashioned in its tannins. They're so strong, they freeze the palate with astringency, like a shot of Novacaine. It's also very dry, despite sweetly ripe blackberry essence, licorice and dark chocolate. All indications are that this is an ageworthy wine.

74422,US,"The vineyard has been source to Pinot Noirs from Copain and Drew, and this one, from Winemaker Jon Grant shows a somewhat Cabernet-esque interpretation. The wine is dark, tannic and medium-bodied, and quite extracted in the flashily ripe cherry and cola fruit that Monument Tree ripens so well in a cool, long hangtime year like 2010. Despite the richness, this is an elegant, ageworthy wine, whose low alcohol will delight many who critique California Pinot Noir for clumsiness.

74977,US,"Just beautiful to drink now, despite grippy tannins that give the ripe fruit an astringent mouthfeel. Based on Cabernet Franc, the wine's flavors are simply delicious, offering waves of cherries, blueberries, plums and currants. Plenty of new oak adds toasty vanilla.

The black cherries and cola are accompanied by firm mineral and earthy notes that make this strikingly different from your typical fruit-forward Cabernet, but then, the alcohol is a modest 13.7% by volume. All indications are of ageability. Could age at least eight years in the cellar.",,92,75.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frog's Leap
74986,US,"Made from mountain grapes, this is an extraordinarily rich, concentrated young Cabernet Sauvignon. It's marked by classic varietal flavors of blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and cassis liqueur. A minor quibble is that it's too soft and melted for further development, but it scores high on the deliciousness scale.",Prevail Back Forty,92,85.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ferrari-Carano
74987,US,"Just delicious, offering sweetly ripe blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors, with a rich coating of smoky oak. The all-important tannins are soft and gentle.

74989,US,"This is a great Napa Valley Merlot, from a winery with a generally good track record with the variety. The grapes were grown in the Coombsville region, although they were allowed to get very ripe, resulting in fairly high alcohol and rich cherry, berry, dark chocolate and anise flavors.

74991,France,"Part of the musical note series from Lannac Saint-Jean, this is the top of the wines. The color is so dark and so are the dense black fruit flavors.

74992,US,"With firm acidity and big tannins, this Cabernet is nowhere ready to drink. It shows an almost old-time Howell Mountain aggressiveness. It's also relatively low in alcohol, the kind of wine that Napa doesn't produce much of anymore. All signs, including an intense concentration of blackberries and stone fruits, are that it's an ager. Cellar until 2017.",,92,150.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Notre Vin
74993,US,"). Very good wine from a winery increasingly known for its red varieties, and one of the best Cabernets ever to hail from this appellation.

74994,US,"An intense concentration of blackberry and cassis fruit marks this dry, opulent wine. It could easily be a Cabernet Sauvignon, with its rich vein of tannins and distinguished structure.

74996,US,"A very earthy Pinot Noir from the gorgeous Oppenlander Vineyard. The wine—from mostly Pommard clones—is a heady mix of aromatic mushrooms growing in dirt and bright cherry-strawberry notes, finished by a lilting lift of rose petal and supple spice.
