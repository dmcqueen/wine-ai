It's medium bodied, with a clean, refreshing finish. Good value.",Premium Rosé Brut,89,22.0,Tasmania,Tasmania,,Sparkling Blend,Jansz
25001,US,"Not an easy wine to appreciate now. It's tannic, and the fruit is fresh and primary, with the sweet, candied taste of a chewy raspberry twist. Still, there's something complex and interesting going on. It's not just another overripe Zin. Give it a year or two to come around.",Black-Sears Vineyard,89,40.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Zinfandel,V. Sattui
25002,Spain,"Sappy green apple, grapefruit and citrus aromas are welcoming and pure, while the palate is soft-edged, citrusy and full or tangerine and melon flavors.

25003,France,"Apart from making its own branded wines, the go-ahead Buzet cooperative sells a number of wines from privately-owned estates. This wine is firmly in the tradition of Bordeaux blends, with its dry tannins and firm, licorice and bitter chocolate flavors.

25006,US,"Vintage seems to have made all the difference in this 100% Cabernet. The 2005 was rich and fat, the 2006 less so. You'll find plenty of acidity framing the juicy blackberry and black currant flavors. It seems to be very finely layered, so your best bet is to cellar it for 6–8 years and see what happens.",Winfield Vineyard,89,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,The Grade
25007,US,"Aromas of lush black cherries, coffee grinds and darkly toasted oak meld effortlessly in winemaker Roman Roth's powerful Long Island Merlot.

25010,US,"Beautifully perfumed with luscious stonefruit and a hint of jasmine blossoms, but not at all cloying, this off-dry Riesling is another favorite from Hermann J. Wiemer.

Wiemer
25011,Spain,"Nutty and toasty, with toffee and butter pecan aromas. The palate is wet, light, alert and snappy, but also angular and citrusy.

25016,France,"By softening the extract and reducing the use of wood, Luc de Conti has succeeded in making a smooth, elegant wine in a difficult year.

25035,Australia,"Unlike many of its brethren, this Eden Valley Riesling relies on weight and texture rather than a fine line of acid to make an impression.

25050,Spain,"Floral fruit aromas suggest blueberry, but overall this vintage lacks the power and depth that Termes and its big brothers are known for. Airing sets up sweet, easygoing berry flavors and full tannins, but in the middle it's less whole than it has been in other years.

25486,US,"This is made from declassified barrels originally intended for Stevens 424.

25492,US,"There's an aroma and taste of hay, or dried twigs, in this Pinot that dominates the cherry fruit. It's also pretty tannic.

25493,US,"A difficult Pinot Noir to evaluate. It's very dry, acidic and tannic, with sharp flavors of blackberries that sweeten into jam on the finish. The question is one of ageability.

25508,Spain,"Normally this producer's high-end Sherries are outstanding, but this Amontillado is aggressive and hard, with a clod-like character that starts with molasses on the nose and then turns toward sharpness and bitterness on the palate.

26599,US,"A very nice Chardonnay that offers enough richness to justify the price, yet retains an elegant restraint that won't overpower food.

26603,US,"Don't reject this Syrah, Petite Sirah and Cabernet blend because it's non-vintage. So are many great Champagnes. Made from the 2006 and 2007 vintages, it's absolutely delicious, so stuffed with blackberry, black currant and bacon flavors, you can't help but be impressed.

26623,US,"As in past vintages, this is half DuBrul and half Meek vineyard fruit. It's a far cry from what most consumers would think of as Merlot—this is a stiff, tannic, muscular wine, with a deep earthiness that speaks of rich loam and ancient rock.

26627,US,"New oak stands out in toast and caramelized wood sweetness on this Cab, overshining to some degree the underlying blackberry, cherry and black currant fruit. It's quite a fashionable, delectable young wine, and will probably be consumed too early by many people who buy it, but it's really a cellar candidate.

The tannins are obvious, but sweetly ripe and soft. A brilliant evocation of Napa Cabernet, despite a high production level of nearly 30,000 cases, which is about the same size as a Bordeaux first growth.

26676,Germany,"Sweet and viscous, this ratchets up the level of sugar and concentration beyond that of Weil's 2009 auslesen.

It's so ripely exuberant in fruit, explosive in wild berry, dried red currant, licorice, cocoa and dusty spice flavors that sink deep into the palate and last forever on the finish.

Delicious now, and should age well for 10–20 years.",Wehlener Sonnenuhr Auslese,94,40.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,S.A. Prüm
26684,Germany,"So unctuous and decadently sweet that this is one of those TBAs that's best taken in very small sips. Dried apricot, candied pear and caramelized pineapple flavors are concentrated and intense, lingering sweetly on the long finish.",Wehlener Sonnenuhr Vat 59 Trockenbeerenauslese,94,440.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,S.A. Prüm
26685,Austria,"Intensely rich wine that flows opulently. Rounded warm and concentrated, it has spice, pepper as well as pineapple and peach fruit. It is not sweet but the unctuous character makes it feel so. Needs at least five years in bottle.",Kammerner Lamm Erste Lage Reserve,94,,Kamptal,,,Grüner Veltliner,Bründlmayer
26686,US,"Spicy, fruity and extremely youthful, this complex wine brings black cherry and cassis flavors with subtle notes of cola, licorice, allspice, sandalwood and pine needle. Still quite tight and primary, it has been beautifully sculpted into a focused wine with a long life ahead.",Arcus Estate,94,100.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Archery Summit
26687,US,"This very limited, concrete-egg-fermented, and thoroughly splendid Pinot Gris is a good indication of the potential for PG in Oregon if the price limitations are lifted. Stunningly rich with citrus, lemon curd, ripe apple and light tropical fruits, this concentrated, deeply driven wine is both roundly full and amazingly dense. Certainly the best Oregon Pinot Gris in memory.",AB OVO,94,42.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris,Archery Summit
26688,US,"This is a frankly delicious young Cabernet, hailing from a small vineyard to showcase its qualities. It's deeply flavored in blackberries and currants, with the most delicious dark chocolate sweetness. Yet it also has the tannic backbone to last. It's one of those wines you can drink now, or age for at least six years to see what it can do.",Tomahawk,94,115.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chimney Rock
26689,US,"Another fine 9-3-5 Cabernet from Hunnicutt. The numbers symbolize the proprietors' wedding date. It's a splendid wine, if a little too young. Toasty oak and tannins dominate, but way underneath is a vast, sweet network of blackberries and black currants. You can certainly decant it for a few hours and enjoy now, but this is a wine that should age seriously for a good 8, 10, 12 years. It's a blend of St. Helena, Rutherford and Oakville fruit.",9-3-5,94,90.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hunnicutt
26690,US,"One of the best Merlots of the vintage. Does what Merlot's supposed to do, flatter the palate with soft, voluptuous richness. Blackberry pie, red cherry, currant, licorice, mocha, bacon and pepper flavors flood the mouth, leading to a long, spicy finish. Defines the opulent, cult style of California Merlot.",Fortuna Vineyard,94,55.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Merlot,Turnbull
26691,Germany,"This historic estate certainly excelled with sweet wines in 2009. This auslese is lusciously sweet yet lithe, its ripe stone fruit—apricot and peach—balanced by citrusy notes. Finishes long and clean, not cloying. Delicious now, but should easily be capable of aging for 20–30 years.",Auslese,94,200.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Schloss Johannisberger
26692,US,"All kinds of fantastic things swirl together in this complex, intricate Pinot Noir, but it's too young to touch for a while. The '09 vintage was a great one for Arista's Pinots, and this bottling is their best, a small-production blend of four vineyards. Purists will object that it's a little too forward in sweet fruit, but the raspberries and cherries have interesting cola and mushroom complexities that sing of the soil, while lots of new oak adds rich layers of toast. Beautiful, but needs 4–5 years to begin to come around.",Two Birds,94,68.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Arista
26693,France,"The top wine of Château du Cèdre is beautifully balanced, its chewy tannins given the right perspective by the impressively dark fruits. The wine is brooding, profound, concentrated and complex. Age for at least 6 years.",Le Cèdre,94,56.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Château du Cèdre
26694,Germany,"Perhaps a step behind Weil's other supersweet 2009s, this eiswein remains a prodigious effort. The candied pineapple and golden raisin notes are so intense, so concentrated that they're almost painful to taste, lingering virtually forever on the finish.",Kiedrich Gräfenberg Eiswein,94,376.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Robert Weil
26695,US,"Masses of lemondrop candy, pineapple tart and mashed ripe pears in this marvelous wine, but that's not all. Buttered toast, crème brûlée, bananas sautéed in butter and brown sugar are some of the additional complexities. That makes the wine sound sweet, but it finishes dry. High in alcohol, but balanced, this flamboyant Chardonnay is best enjoyed now.",Hawk Hill Vineyard,94,50.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
26696,Germany,"Like all of the Schloss's noble sweet wines, this one isn't overblown, displaying ample sweetness but also zesty acidity. There's a slight greenish hint to the candied citrus and dried pineapple flavors, with a lemony streak on the finish that balances the sweetness impeccably. Should last for 40–50 years—possibly more—in a cool cellar.",Serrig Schloss Saarsteiner Beerenauslese Goldkapsel,94,231.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Schloss Saarstein
26697,Austria,"A rich wine, very balanced with ripe peach flavors enlivened by acidity, orange zest and an edge of spice. The wine is lush while also mineral and will likely develop over the next 3–4 years. The aftertaste is gorgeous and very ripe.",Loiser Berg Erste Lage Reserve,94,,Kamptal,,,Grüner Veltliner,Bründlmayer
26698,Germany,"A terrific auslese, sweet but balanced near perfectly by lime-like acids. It's stony yet honeyed, concentrated yet somehow light on its feet. Then it's bright, fresh and full of juicy citrus fruit on the finish.",Ürziger Würzgarten Auslese,94,64.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Dr. Loosen
26699,US,"Lush and luscious, this is a standout among the 2009 Erath Pinots. The richness of the fruit gives this zaftig wine immense appeal, with deep cherry flavors streaked with gun metal, anise, mocha, and coffee. A lick of dark chocolate ensures a glorious finish.",Prince Hill,94,45.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Erath
26700,Italy,"This intense and determined Nebbiolo from the Martinenga cru of Barbaresco delivers enticing aromas of black fruit, smoke, tar, licorice and old spice.

26701,US,"This has been Riverbench's best Pinot and it still is. Shows the wonderful ability to be deliciously drinkable now, yet with the stuffing for the cellar. Dry and crisp and full-bodied, it shows berry, currants, mushroom, grilled meat and sandalwood flavors, dusted with Indian spices. Now–2015.",Mesa,92,48.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Riverbench
26702,France,"With its high percentage of Champagne's third grape, Pinot Meunier, as a result of the growing conditions of 2003, this is a great wine that is developing fast. It has more toast, less fruit, although its richness and weight are finely in balance with a yeasty cookie dough character.",Grand Vintage Brut,92,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Moët & Chandon
26703,Italy,"Nebbiolo, the grape, and Nubiola, the designate name, stem from the same Italian word: nebbia, or “fog” that regularly blankets the Langhe. This bright Barbaresco is defined by a distinctive aroma of tar or freshly applied street asphalt that is typical of the variety. Additional aromas include back fruit, prune and plum. The mouthfeel is streamlined, tight and elegant.",Nubiola,92,38.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Pelissero
26704,Italy,"A relative newcomer, Massimo Rattalino makes an impressive debut with this tasty Barbaresco.

Those bright aromas are surrounded by drying graphite nuances, bright acidity and polished tannins.",Quarantadue42,92,,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Rattalino
26705,US,"Classic Rutherford Cab. Dry, dusty and slightly herbal, with refined, jammy flavors of red and black cherries, currants, mocha and cedar. The alcohol is a little high, giving this 100% Cabernet a warm, full-bodied feel. The tannins suggest mid-term aging. 2013–2018.",Firehouse Vineyard,92,85.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Piña
26706,US,"Shows enormous complexity of flavor, a wine that really impresses for its myriad blackberry, cherry, currant, cola, grilled meat, sautéed mushroom, violet and chocolate flavors. If the structure were more firm, it would be a perfect wine. But this is Paso Robles, where the wines will always be soft. A blend of Syrah and Petite Sirah.",Syrée,92,39.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Syrah-Petite Sirah,Vina Robles

26709,US,"No winery in California has explored this French variety more than Cambiata, and with the '06, they've produced another interesting wine.

26710,US,"Although there's a lot of oak on this wine, it's not heavy or fat in the excessive California style, because the underlying wine is so crisp and elegant. Call it Chablisian. It shows mineral, Meyer lemon and lime flavors, with brilliant acidity. Really quite a fine Carneros Chardonnay.",,92,38.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Etude
26711,Italy,"Barolo Bricco delle Viole is a lush and generous wine with a bright ruby color and attractively intense aromas of cherry, wild berry, nutmeg, clove, powdered licorice and root beer. The oak influence is still obvious at this early stage, but will no doubt integrate with time. The mouthfeel is exceedingly soft, smooth and velvety. You don't need to wait too many years before uncorking this bottle.",Bricco delle Viole,92,75.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,G D Vajra
26712,Italy,"Very different than the 2005 vintage, Barolo Le Coste from Giacomo Grimaldi opens with a brownish-amber color and ripe berry or candied fruit aromas.

A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.",Le Coste,92,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Giacomo Grimaldi
26713,Italy,"There are some ripe notes here of black cherry and raspberry (2007 was a hot, dry vintage in Piedmont) but you'll also get territory-driven notes of wet earth and dried beef or bresaola. The mouthfeel is dry and firm thanks to the elegantly polished nature of the tannins.",Sorì Burdin,92,60.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Fontanabianca

26715,Italy,"Monsordo is an innovative concept and is a premier example of a modern, international wine with unmistakable roots in Piedmont.

26718,Italy,"Here's a wine that begs a pairing with a truffle dish: black truffle Cornish hen or creamy risotto with white truffle flakes would do the trick.

This is a beautiful wine with a firm, determined but elegant finish.",Cannubi San Lorenzo,92,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Cavalier Bartolomeo
26719,Italy,"Neirane is a balanced Barolo with soft notes of cherry, black fruit and spice wrapped tight around a solid core of quality fruit.

26721,US,"The word inky must have been invented for this pure Cabernet Franc, sourced from the Weinbau vineyard (the label is misprinted). In the world of Cabernet Franc, many are called, and few are chosen. This is one of the chosen. Dense, tightly threaded with smoke, earth, black olive, black cherry, cassis and mocha scents and flavors, this nonetheless drinks smoothly. The tannin management is superb, softening up the hard edges without stripping the wine of flavor.",,92,29.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Franc,Nefarious Cellars

26768,US,"A wonderful red wine, full-bodied, dry and elegant. It shows Cabernet character in the blackberries, cherries and black currants, but that's balanced with an earthiness and minerality and even some smoked meat notes that must come from a percentage of Syrah and Petite Sirah. Tasted in a flight of much more expensive Cabs, this one easily stood out. Drink now–2011.",,92,16.0,California,Mendocino-Lake,North Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bonterra
26769,Italy,"Barolo Bricco Rocca still needs a few more years in the cellar to allow for full integrations of its spice, fruit, tobacco and mineral components.

26775,Chile,"Chile's most expensive wine is excellent, and with only 50 cases being imported it's definitely a collector's edition. The nose is deep, dense and black as night, with olive, tobacco, coconut and bold black fruit aromas.

26776,US,"Here's a Cabernet to age for a while. It's very dry and richly flavored in classic varietal flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar, with finely ground, intense tannins. But it has a youthful immaturity that simply isn't ready to appreciate now. Really needs time for all the parts to mesh together. Give it until 2012, and it should develop bottle complexity for another 5–6 years.",,92,100.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Etude
26777,US,"Tart and leafy, this is still resolving into a fully integrated wine.

26804,Germany,"Are the '09 auslesen from Manfred Prüm just in a dull phase? This wine still impresses for its scents of crushed stone and latent power, but the peach, melon and citrus notes fall a little short of expectations for this venerated estate.

26807,US,"Oak brings strong buttered toast and vanilla flavors to this Chardonnay. But it's also a powerhouse from the vineyard, with massive orange, pineapple and apricot flavors.

26815,South Africa,"A stunning Cab that's a little bit of an easy-pleaser with an assertive oaky streak througout.

26819,US,"Richness marks this flamboyantly fruity, sweet young Pinot Noir.

26849,US,". Though it is five years old and just being released, this thick, tannic and rich Bordeaux blend still requires decanting, cellaring, and/or extensive breathing time. A full day after first being tasted, it came together for me; the initial, aggressively herbal character is equally matched to ripe black cherry fruit and massive tannins. The nose suggests sweet cherry, but the palate leans more to the herbal side, with flavors of earth, stem and leaf, and there is a green tea residual flavor that infuses the finish.

Although stylistically a brother to the Stevens Merlot, this has the varietal earmarks of Cabernet Franc – some green, leafy streaks, more spice and sharpness to the tannins, and a definite herbal component.

27345,US,"Under the Feather label, this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon styled by Napa's Randy Dunn s the only one pure varietal red wine in the Long Shadows collection. Eucalyptus aromas rise instantly as it's poured, leading into a smooth, appealing flavors of plum and cassis fruit.

It lacks the heft of past vintages.",,89,60.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Feather
27346,US,"In this pungent wine, Syrah is co-fermented with a touch of Viognier, then blended with 33% Grenache. Interesting scents of diesel, soil and stem wrap into the tight red berry fruit.

27352,US,"Despite the delicate salmon color, the flavors of this medium-bodied rosé have a bit of the breadth and depth of a red wine.

27353,US,"A bold Chardonnay that embraces new oak barrels and has the flavor profile to show for it. Hovey fermented it in 50% new oak barrels, matured it on the lees and bottled it a few months after harvest. The scent and flavor of toasted oak comes through from the first sniff to the finish.

27389,Chile,"The 2010 vintage was cold by Chilean standards, and that's reflected in this strange-smelling wine that's loaded with pine, juniper and foresty aromas.

27406,France,"In Champagne-speak, Extra Dry means sweeter than Brut, so this is a soft wine, fruity rather than mineral.

29254,US,"As rich as this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is, and it is extraordinarily rich, there's something standard about it. It's as though the ripeness of the fruit has obliterated any trace of terroir. Offers a fantastically sweet explosion of blackberries, cherries, plums and chocolate, alongside caramelized, butterscotchy oak, but beyond the sheer power, the wine isn't displaying much subtlety.

33269,Argentina,"Pencil lead and rubbery, mature berry aromas open this wine.

Yet appealing as it is now, there are multiple subtleties waiting to be discovered, and the wine has a fine future. Like all of Marimar's Pinots, it's a big wine—rich and extracted and dense in weight. The flavors veer towards ripe pomegranates, black cherries and sweet licorice, with hints of dark chocolate, orange peel and even the umami of charcuterie.

It's a barrel selection of the winery's best lots, from its various vineyards, and has been aged in 100% new French oak. Yet it's not oaky at all, with the wood bringing only additional sweet, smoky richness to the red currants, cherries, dark chocolate and spices.

33338,US,"This is a barrel selection, presumably limited in cases. It's an extraordinarily rich, concentrated 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, made in the modern cult-style of massively extracted blackberries, black currants, cassis liqueur and chocolate, with oak bringing the usual sweet toast and vanilla complexities.

It's drinking beautifully, and has the color and scent of a mature wine, though Eyrie Pinots can often live longer than those who bet against them.

Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend is young now, with hard tannins that interfere with the fruit.

33343,US,"The trick with getting a Chardonnay this honeyed is to keep it balanced and make it finish dry. Lynmar accomplishes these tasks with dexterity. Partly because of the acidity, partly the stony, crystalline minerality. The wine is terrifically rich in tropical fruits, melons, sweet Meyer lemons and ripe summer peaches, with all the buttered toast you could ever want from oak. In lesser hands, it would all be too much.",Susanna's Vineyard,94,55.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar

33350,US,"Among Kiona's strengths, the dessert wines are right at the top. This wine—comparable in many ways to the Single Berry Select from Eroica (which costs more than twice as much)—features Chenin Blanc rather than Riesling, and why not? It's a seductive, delicious bottle that expresses the condensed essence of the grape. Even at 274 g/L of residual sugar, it does not translate to a cloying or super-sweet wine; rather it is buoyed by supporting acidity, while filling the mouth with candied fruits, flowers, and buttery pastry notes.",Single Berry Select Botrytised,94,80.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Chenin Blanc,Kiona
33351,US,"This very interesting wine treads a delicate balance between exuberantly ripe persimmons and cherries, and earthier notes of red tomatoes. But those tomatoes are rich and satisfying, like summer heirloom varieties picked fresh off the vine that are sweet as a peaches.

33354,US,"If there's one California Pinot Noir you cellar this vintage, make it this one. It's a stone-cold guarantee. Light and silky in the mouth, with brisk acidity, it shows rich raspberry, cherry, red currant and sandalwood flavors that are deep and long.

33355,US,"What a great follow-up to the 2009 vintage. You can put this in the cellar with entire confidence that it will age for likely 10–20 years, and actually improve. At nearly three years of age, it's rich and vibrant with black currants, blueberries and dark chocolate, and a big hit of sweet oak. But the tannins are impossible, locking the mouth down with astringency. It's a pity that most of the 2l,064 bottles produced will probably be opened too young.",Révélation,94,140.0,California,Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Capture

33357,US,"Gary Farrell is one of the few wineries to obtain fruit from this coveted vineyard. As always, the wine is intensely concentrated in tropical fruits, green apples and pears, with such weight that it can easily handle lavish new French oak.

33404,Argentina,"Reedy and green on the nose, then choppy and clipped on the palate.

33540,US,"Off-dry, this succulent wine has you smacking your lips rather than puckering them. The natural acidity buoys up the sweet fruit, a mix of peach and apricot principally, and the wine has an excellent focused core that trails off into suggestions of honeycomb and lemon custard.",Estate Grown,90,18.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Southern Oregon,Riesling,Girardet
33541,US,"This wine presents an old-fashioned style, marked by hard, numbing tannins that frame ripe flavors of blackberries, licorice, cherries, mocha and black currants.

33544,US,"This is a full-bodied wine that belies the notion that Oregon always makes a sleeker style of Chardonnay. Here are ripe, round flavors of peach and mango, wrapped in naturally vivid acidity, with a warming sensation in the finish. Best enjoyed soon, while fresh and young.",Dijon 76 Estate,90,27.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay,Carabella

33547,US,"Cabernet specialist Venge brings its vision of big, bold wines to Chardonnay, with mixed results. The wine is huge and fruity, with massive pineapple, pear, crème brûlée, buttered toast, caramel and vanilla spice flavors, in which oak obviously plays a part. Yet it's almost too much of a good thing. It earns its high score for sheer power, but you find yourself wanting greater subtlely and finesse.",Maldonado Vineyard,90,39.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Venge
33548,Italy,"Tre Saggi, or three wise men, is a terrific wine at a realistic price.

33549,US,"Shows the fantastic power and extracted fruit that this vineyard is famous for. Just massive in apricots, tangerines and pears, it's enriched with sweet smoky oak, which adds vanilla bean and buttered toast to the richness. Fortunately, brisk acidity and minerality provide balance.",Logan Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Estate Grown,90,23.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Talbott
33550,Italy,"This grand wine, with its heavy consistency, tannic backbone and aromatic intensity, should pair well with aged cheeses or grilled red meat.

The mouthfeel is equally huge and bold.",,90,,Southern Italy,Aglianico del Vulture,,Aglianico,Tenuta del Portale
33551,US,"Supple and muscular, with appealing bacon fat aromas, this round and spicy effort. A tightness in the midpalate suggests that further bottle age is in order.",Domaine Danielle Laurent,90,50.0,Oregon,Yamhill-Carlton District,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Soléna

33557,US,"Cedarville takes a lot of pride in its Cab, and this definitely screams mightily of its mountain, granite-soiled origins, with a rich mouthfeel and rocky minerality.

33558,US,"An early freeze shut down the vineyards in 2009, and produced wines that are less immediately generous than the ripe, fruit-driven 2008s. The vanilla wafer aromas from barrel aging show prominently here, with the wild berry fruit being tart and so compact as to be almost invisible at first. But patience is rewarded, as the wine fills in gracefully with nuanced notes of herb and dried leaf, as well as balanced acids.",Jerusalem Hill,89,85.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Domaine Serene

33560,Germany,"Perhaps because of its slow, natural fermentation in large casks and the resulting lees contact, this wine shows a bit of toasty, mealy character and a slightly creamy texture.

33561,US,"This clean and leesy Chardonnay was fermented half in stainless, half in neutral oak.

33562,Chile,"Piercing on the nose, with aromas of cola, graphite, juniper and blackberry. Feels thick, with meaty flavors of blackberry, boysenberry, herb and flower notes.

33563,US,"This has the classic flavors of many Oregon Pinot Noirs, a balanced mix of tangy red fruits, mineral, earth and more than a hint of stem.

33582,France,"A disappointing effort from a normally reliable producer, this wine shows entirely too many rubbery, chemical aromas and flavors.

33594,US,"An extremely rich texture, like pear juice, and sweet flavors of ripe pear, peach and pineapple give this wine a big personality.

All that sweetness and richness suggest a good pairing with salty cheeses.",,83,15.0,California,California,California Other,Chardonnay,401K

Drink now or age for many years.",Saziani Essenz Trockenbeerenauslese,94,,Südoststeiermark,,,Austrian white blend,Neumeister
33632,US,"This is McCrea's top cuvée, and the 2008 is as good as it has ever been. Co-fermented with 8% Viognier, it starts out tight and compact, with crisp marionberry fruit and a generous wash of coffee liqueur. The acids are citrusy and fresh, and the wine has depth and an emotional range that reaches almost symphonic power.",Cuvée Orleans,94,40.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,McCrea Cellars
33633,US,"This precisely crafted wine lifts Carneros Chardonnay to a whole new level. Yes, it's pricey, but so complex and decadent, it's worth it. The alcohol is refreshingly low, the acidity is bright, and there's a lick of steel to balance the nectarine and mango fruit, buttered-toast and cream flavors.",Hudson Vineyard,93,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Failla
33634,US,"The Dijon clones (667 and 777) used in this wine yield unusually pure, intensely clean flavors of raspberries, cherries and anise, at a moderate alcohol level. The vineyard location and cool vintage must have contributed to the acidic bite. It's a very fine wine—elegant and noble—but immature. You'll want to cellar it for 5–6 years to allow it to show its stuff.",Hallberg Vineyard-Dijon Clones,93,60.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell
33635,Germany,"This wine is unabashedly forward with sweet, juicy, stonefruit intensity, yet remarkably composed.

Prüm
33636,US,"Classic Howell Mountain Cabernet. The fruit is intense and concentrated in black currants and cocoa, the tannins are strong and hard, the acidity is perfect, the finish is entirely dry, and there's a firm minerality. So deliciously elegant now, it's hard to resist, but this Cab will surely reward cellaring through at least 2017.",,93,75.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bjorn
33637,US,"This wine was made from very specific Pinot Noir clones planted in a small block of the estate vineyard. It's exceptionally ripe with raspberry and cherry flavors, and plenty of new oak. A big wine, it's dark in color and impressive in weight, yet maintains a complex lightness of being. Drink now–2017.",Chico's Run Doña Margarita Vineyard Unfiltered,93,48.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate

Luscious and lingering.",Elerding Vineyard,93,24.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Viognier,Stottle
33639,Spain,"This inky, jammy smelling Toro is overflowing with blackberry and blueberry aromas. In the mouth, grabby tannins rise up with power, creating a rugged mouthfeel. Flavors of blackberry, charred oak, burnt meat and blackened spices finish dark, toasty, peppery and slightly bitter. Talk about a serious Toro with massive flavors and pounding tannins; drink from 2014 through 2019.",Victorino,93,63.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
33640,US,"Any warm California region can ripen fruit to this degree, resulting in blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. But Napa's special magic concerns the wine's structure. Here, you'll find fantastically firm tannins and quite a bit of acidity. Both give the wine the architecture to house all the richness. Drink now, after decanting, and over the next 10 years.",Estate,93,85.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,St. Supéry
33641,US,"This is a lovely Pinot Noir, with a translucent ruby color. It's dry, delicately structured, moderate in alcohol and complex. The cherry, pomegranate and persimmon flavors have a pleasant tea-like bitterness, along with earthy notes of mushrooms and sweet wild herbs. At this price, it's one of the greatest bargains on the market. Unfortunately, only 800 cases are in circulation.",,93,25.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Reaper
33642,US,"There's a delicacy to this Pinot that makes it a welcome alternative to the big, clumsy style. The color is translucent, and the alcohol is relatively low, giving it a nice, bouncy mouthfeel. The depth of flavor is impressive, suggesting ripe forest raspberries and cherries, and a hint of mushrooms. It would be a pity to drink this wine before 2017.",Jensen Vineyard,93,75.0,California,Mt. Harlan,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Calera
33643,US,"Fantastic fruit, tantalizing acidity and overall balance mark this Pinot. It's ripe with cherries, pomegranates, rhubarb and persimmons, while plentiful new oak is perfectly in keeping with the underlying power.

33644,US,"This is 100% varietal Merlot, aged 15 months in new and neutral French oak barrels and botti. It's tangy, sleek and supple, with a spectrum of fruit from cranberry on through blackberry.

33645,US,"This is a very expensive Cabernet, but it also tastes dramatic and powerful.

Should age well for the next 10 years.",,93,120.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Linked
33646,US,"The XY Reserve from Stevens is the best of an outstanding lineup of cellar-worthy, Yakima Valley red wines.

This may be decanted and enjoyed immediately, or cellared indefinitely.",XY Reserve,93,45.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stevens
33647,US,"Kudos to vintner Eddy for holding this back for nearly six years. It's still fresh, with rich blackberry, cherry, mocha and oak flavors.

Hold until 2018.",,93,95.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tom Eddy
33648,US,"Extraordinarily rich, ripe and flashy, this is a delicious wine to drink now, although it has the tannic structure to age.

Will continue to evolve positively over the next 5–6 years.",Alliance,93,90.0,California,Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Capture
33649,France,"A powerful, wood-aged rosé that shows great richness, density and structure.

33650,US,"As in the past, Leonetti's 2010 Sangiovese was co-fermented with Syrah (11%), and sourced from Seven Hills, Pepper Bridge and Mill Creek Upland vineyards. It's flat-out delicious from the first scents of barrels and fruits, right on through a lush palate rich in flavors of berries, rum-soaked cherries and exotic spices. A long finish, with a smoky/earthy cast, is supported with tart acids.",,93,65.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sangiovese,Leonetti Cellar
33651,US,"An awesomely rich Pinot Noir, this is a big wine that's darkly colored and intensely layered with raspberry, chocolate, spice and mushroom notes. Lots of new oak shows up, but it's balanced against the wine's power. Delicious now, but should reward aging over the next eight years.",Stony Block Don Miguel Vineyard Unfiltered,93,47.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate

33654,Chile,"As Chilean Carmenère goes, this is one of the best and most true to the grape. Dusty, dry, earthy aromas of spiced berry, herbs and cocoa lead to a lofty palate with both creamy oak and driving acids. Oak-related flavors of vanilla and coconut sit on top of spicy, baked berry flavors, while the finish is full, woody, creamy and dense. Drink this excellent Carmenère now through 2017.",Herencia,93,90.0,Peumo,,,Carmenère,Santa Carolina
33655,US,"Tough and gritty, with hard tannins, this is definitely astringent and dry, but it does show classic Napa character. Blended with Cabernet Franc and Merlot, it's rich in blackberry, black cherry, currant and dark chocolate flavors that finish long. It would be a mistake to drink this wine too young. Cellar it until 2018, and it should provide mature beauty well beyond.",,93,49.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Redmon
33656,US,"At nearly seven years in age, this 100% Cabernet is still offering ripe, fresh blackberry, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and oak flavors.

33657,US,"Enormously concentrated in blackberry and cherry llqueur and currant flavors, wrapped into hard tannins, this is a classic Von Strasser Cabernet.

33659,US,"The Boushey cuvée—100% varietal—really delivers the goods. Cassis and blueberry, cherry and plum, high acidity and nuanced notes of toasted nuts, graphite and smoked meats are all in play.

33660,US,"The blend includes a half-dozen grapes, principally Mourvèdre and Syrah. It tastes muted, as if the mélange of fruit sources more or less cancelled each other out.

33665,Spain,"This funky white from the island of Mallorca is 50% Premsal and 50% Callet, and if you've never heard of those grapes you're not alone. The nose is a bit harsh and strange, while the palate is on the flat side. Flavors of ham, pithy citrus and nectarine finish jumbled.

33669,France,"A hint of nail polish or paint thinner prevents this wine from scoring higher.

34270,Israel,"With a dark red violet color and aromas of black cherry and fennel, this wine has flavors of black cherry, mint and clove.

34275,US,It's rich enough to satisfy our craving for fruit flavor and firm enough in texture to pair well with roasts and filling pasta.

34287,US,"Light pepper, cassis and a hint of leather form the nose on this wine from a brand founded in 1994 specifically to deliver quality wines at affordable prices.

Drink now through 2017.",Edicion Limitada Single Vineyard,92,40.0,Cachapoal Valley,,,Syrah,Lagar de Bezana
34292,Austria,"A rounded style of Sauvignon Blanc that has a full feeling to it.

Worth aging for 2–3 years.",Klausen,92,,Südoststeiermark,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Neumeister

It's dry and superbly structured in acids and tannins, and shows a chalky minerality that lends substance to the tropical fruit and honeysuckle flavors.

34294,US,"A mix of rose petals and cherry blossoms wafts up from the glass, introducing a delightfully silky Pinot Noir that adds layer upon layer of interest as it runs across the tongue.

34295,US,"California rosé is awfully hard to get right. It's usually too sweet, too heavy or both. With this Grenache-Cinsault blend, Minassian-Young knocks it out of the park. The wine is dry, delicate, modest in alcohol, and complex, with subtle peach, rosehip tea, orange zest, watermelon and spice flavors. A great bargain, but only 64 cases were produced.",Grenache-Cinsault,92,16.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Rosé,Minassian-Young

Rich layers of crushed stone and mineral oil linger deliciously on the finish.",Wallhausen Johannisberg GG Trocken,92,,Nahe,,,Riesling,Prinz Salm
34298,US,"This is a pretty Pinot that's light and silky on the palate, and comforting in its moderate alcohol and spicy, exotic flavors. It offers waves of wild forest berry pie, baking spice, sweet-and-sour persimmon and sandalwood flavors that are intriguingly complex. Absolutely delightful now.",,92,49.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
34299,US,"While this is the most tannic of Envy's wines, it's also made in the house style of soft, fruity approachability.

Wonderful now and over the next 3–4 years.",Estate,92,48.0,California,Calistoga,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Envy
34300,US,"Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend will make you take a second look at Paso Robles. It's softly tannic and enormously complex, offering waves of black cherries, currants, licorice, mocha and sweet oak.

34301,US,"Though De Loach's Lake County Zinfandel—a regular in the producer's line-up of prominent wines—is a departure of form in its big-boned nature, it is entirely in keeping with its sister wines in terms of balance. Fragrant and spicy, with a depth of blackberry fruit, the finish is long and satisfying. This is a fine food-pairing wine.",Nova Vineyard,92,32.0,California,Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Zinfandel,De Loach
34302,Germany,"Spice and lanolin notes are curious and enticing on the nose and palate of this sunny and sweet, but impeccably balanced Riesling.

34303,Spain,"This is one dark, intense Ribera del Duero with loads of lush black-fruit aromas matched against minerality and fine French-oak scents. It is tight as a drum on the palate, with wiry acidity and rocky tannins. Flavors of oak-driven coconut and cream sit on top of blackberry and cola, while the finish ends abruptly, with hardness. Drink through 2024; 150 cases made.",Clave de Tábula,92,120.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Bodegas y Viñedos Tábula
34304,US,"One of the best Russian River Pinots you can buy at this price.

34306,US,"This is a huge wine, that's insanely rich and concentrated. It tastes like the ripest summer blackberries, still warm from the sun, mashed and drizzed with crème de cassis and chocolate syrup. The estate vineyard is on Paso Robles' west side, and quite high in elevation in the southern spur of the Santa Lucia Mountains. The wine is ungainly now, and needs time to develop. Better after 2017.",Jack of Hearts Petit Verdot,92,50.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jada Vineyard & Winery
34307,Spain,"This is a ripe, rich blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Syrah that opens with blackberry, blueberry and earthy leather aromas. It's full bodied, lifted by nice acids and layered, with toast, meaty blackberry, licorice and roasted flavors. A chewy, smooth, deep finish functions as the final chapter.

34308,US,"The blend of these four Rhône white grapes—47% Grenache Blanc, 32% Marsanne, 16% Roussanne, 5% Picpoul—outshines their individual bottlings. Some sort of magic accrues. The Sirocco is supple, creamy and packed with aromas and flavors of citrus blossom, flesh and rind. It's got a peaches-and-cream mouthfeel, and a lick of butterscotch in the lush finish.",Boushey Vineyard Sirocco Blanc,92,25.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Rhône-style White Blend,McCrea Cellars
34309,US,"Quite a good Cabernet, pure and intense in varietal characteristics of black currants, but balanced and elegant. The tannins are smooth, the finish complex and long in spices. Delicious as it is now, your best bet is to cellar this Cab for 6–8 years, and possibly longer.",,92,52.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Peters Family
34310,US,"This new vintage is sourced from a single block from the Dineen vineyard, and aged in 50% new French oak—the most ever. Black fruits abound, along with licorice, tar and a whiff of iodine. It's a tightly wound Syrah, with the stuffing and style to age for a decade or longer.",BlackTongue,92,30.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Stevens
34311,US,"Shows the usual Williams Selyem Chardonnay profile of huge fruit and flashy oak. This opulent wine would be over-the-top except that it's balanced by crisp, lemony acidity, and somehow retains a tight core with a gravitational tug that keeps the richness focused. Impressive now for sheer power, and should hold well for another 5–6 years.",Heintz Vineyard,92,55.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
34312,US,"This proprietary bottling from Shafer is always a huge wine. The 2010, which contains a splash of Petite Verdot, is gigantically packed with blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and sweet oak, courtesy of 20 months in 100% new French oak barrels. The wine is a bit of a bully now, but it has the balance to age. Give it until 2018.",One Point Five,92,72.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Shafer
34313,US,"Though it's not mentioned on the label, the Malbec is sourced from the Pepper Bridge vineyard, and compares favorably with high end Argentine versions. Yummy and deep, its sweet berry flavors are matched to firm, polished tannins, and finished with a touch of pretty toast.",,92,53.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Malbec,Reininger
34314,France,"A rich, velvet textured wine, full of dense, dusty tannins and sweet black Merlot fruits.

Give this wine at least 5–6 years.",Caractère,92,23.0,Bordeaux,Côtes de Bourg,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château de la Grave
34315,US,"As usual, this is one of Calera's lightest bottlings, in both color and texture. It's deceptively simple, showing softened cola and raspberry jam flavors that finish impressively long and spicy. It would be a mistake to dismiss it for early drinking. Give it a good six years in the cellar, and it could be stunning in 2020.",Reed,92,55.0,California,Mt. Harlan,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Calera
34316,US,"You can almost read through the translucent ruby color of this wine, but there's nothing light about it. Rich with cherries, it offers lots of pleasure now, but with moderate alcohol, fine acidity, and minerality that gives the wine a foundation, it should hold in  the cellar until 2018, at least.",Ryan Vineyard,92,42.0,California,Mt. Harlan,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Calera
34317,Spain,"This is every bit as good as the winery's Clave de Tábula, which costs twice as much. An aromatic opening of fig, prune and blackberry comes with graphite, cola and attractive oak notes. This is intense and shows powerful acidity in support of blackberry, toast and dark, spicy flavors. A medium-long finish with toast and licorice is proper and not overdone. Drink from 2014–2022.",Tábula,92,55.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Bodegas y Viñedos Tábula

34319,France,"With some extra weight, this is a solid, red currant and berry driven wine. Its fruit is right up front, backed by a mineral acidity that cuts through the richness. It's definitely a food wine, and equally an impressive wine that needs to age for up to a year.",Château Romassan,92,46.0,Provence,Bandol,,Rosé,Domaines Ott
34320,US,"Frankly sweet, tasting like a sugared fruit juice blend of tangerines, pineapples and mangoes. Still, it's clean and streamlined in acidity.",,83,15.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Maddalena

34329,Greece,"This blend of Savatiano and Roditis is very popular in Greece and perhaps a bit too exotic for mainstream palates, but it's easy drinking and priced well. Aromas of citrus and melon are followed by peach and honeydew melon flavors. Simple but friendly.",Demestica White,82,10.0,Greece,,,White Blend,Achaia Clauss

34333,Argentina,"For the price, this is not a good effort. It's overoaked and horsey smelling, with a heavy, overripe palate that tastes herbal and like hickory-infused blackberry. Flat and stewy on the finish.",Reserva,82,29.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Cas'Almare

34339,Argentina,"Moscato-like with its jasmine and lychee aromas, but things fall apart in the mouth.

The wine seems more austere than in the past, withholding a bit of the early appeal it used to show.

35529,US,"With Pinot Noir, the magic trick is to have it taste sweet and ripe, and yet to finish bone dry. Few wineries in California accomplish this as regularly as Hanzell, and here they come again, with this wonderful 2008.

35702,Argentina,"Meaty plum and berry aromas come with dark, demanding, minty aromas that are similar to this winery's Lote 44 bottling.

35703,Spain,"Roasted and rubbery smelling, this has heavy oak influence that yields notes of mint and shoe. Shearing on the palate despite its body, this has flavors of oak-based vanilla, mint and sweet-and-sour plum. Prieto Picudo is a difficult grape to make into good wine.",El Médico,83,37.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,,Prieto Picudo,Bodegas del Paramo

35705,Argentina,"Raspy cherry aromas precede a scratchy palate that's characterized by its high acid-to-body ratio.

35712,France,"Milk chocolate, mocha, garrigue and mineral notes contribute to the fragrant nose.

35715,France,"This has a deeply flushed, burgundy core. The reluctant nose shows graphite, game and pepper, with boysenberry and blackberry joining underbrush and cedar on the palate. The very average fruit concentration shows light dilution and leads to a short finish. Moderately drying tannins and lively acidity frame the supple body and will allow it to hold for at least two years though the wine will not likely evolve to benefit.",Tradition,83,,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Chateau Saint Nabor

35720,Mexico,"This wine opens with pepper, leather and stalky berry aromas. It feels sticky in the mouth, with stalky, buttery berry flavors that fall off rather quickly.

35734,US,"American and Hungarian oak barrels were used, adding a rustic, powerful base to this pure Primitivo. Think Zinfandel crossed with Lemberger and you're in the ballpark of its style.

35740,US,"This smells dark and bold, offering Port-like aromas of chocolate ganache, buttercream frosting, brown spice and sun-baked fruit.

35782,US,"There is some alchemy at work here, for this unusual Dolcetto—all 24 cases of it—has the complexity of blended wines. Tart pomegranate fruit, streaks of stem and cement, mint and spice, all rise briefly and then fall away. It's a detailed wine, in the enigmatic style that marks this tiny winery as sui generis. Among the lineup of reds from 2010, it's best of show at the moment.",,90,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Dolcetto,Animale

35786,Chile,"After a few years when Altaïr's wines strayed toward being too herbal and rustic, this is cleaner and easier to like. It's still showing the winery's typical herbal-olive aromas and flavors, but it's smooth in the mouth, with deep flavors of blackberry, cassis, licorice and cocoa.

36609,Italy,"Funky aromas of scorched earth, overripe plum, game and a whiff of barnyard lead the nose.

36637,US,"A little rustic, with a briary, brambly mouthfeel, but it's a good example of a Sonoma County Zinfandel. The winery says the vines are old, and there are deep, concentrated flavors of wild forest berries, shriveled raisins, licorice, pine tar, grilled beef and black peppers.

36696,Argentina,"Smells sweet and artificial, with chemical notes and overwrought vanilla. Juicy in the mouth, with flesh and freshness. But the flavors are oaky, so much so that the wine's citrus and apple quality is masked. Finishes with grapefruit and bitterness.

36701,Argentina,"Opens with warm, baked black fruit aromas and then a wave of woodiness takes control.

36709,Argentina,"While I generally like and sometimes even love the Cobos wines, this Merlot underwhelms. The nose is reedy and stemmy, with earthy, herbal raspberry aromas.

36871,Spain,"Given the difficulties of this cool vintage, this is an excellent wine with dark berry, herb, spice and vanilla aromas.

36873,Spain,"Teso la Monja picked a good vintage to introduce this entry-level Toro. Romanico is big and candied on the nose, with floral berry aromas, milk chocolate and a touch of raisin.

36874,US,"Tasted pre-release, this is clearly ready for prime time. It's both compact and generous, with a core of wild berries soaked in minerals.

36875,US,"This darkly-colored wine is a little on the heavy, fruity side for a rosé. But it's fantastically delicious, offering waves of berries, cola and spices. The acidity is refreshingly high.

36877,US,"Made from single (777) clone, organically-grown grapes, the Blackjack Block Pinot Noir is focused and complex. The mid-palate shows flesh and fat, ripe berry and cherry fruit, with a backing of citrusy acids.

36884,Chile,"This absurdly priced Carmenère is always one of Chile's best, and this vintage is just fine, with cherry, cassis, graphite, herb and eucalyptus-like green aromas.

36887,Spain,"This has a lot of good things going in its favor, for example depth, power and richness. It's also raisiny and oaky, with stewy core flavors of baked berry, cassis, roasted meat and vanilla. The finish is chewy and thick, with vanilla and pastry flavors along with grating tannins.

37216,US,"Shows the rugged tannins and acidity of this old variety, with a full-bodied mouthfeel. Really delivers on the fruit, with dark flavors of mulberries, plums, blackberries and blueberries, as well as an earthy richness. Bone dry and completely balanced, it will develop for more than ten years.",Reserve,93,40.0,California,Calistoga,Napa,Charbono,Shypoke
37217,Portugal,"Now well-established as a Douro classic, this latest vintage of Chryseia shows the same concentration and dense tannins while bringing an extra element of elegance and balance. This gives the wine obvious aging potential, over at least 6–7 years.",Chryseia,93,50.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Prats & Symington LDA
37218,US,"This is a big, hard, tannic wine. It's so buttoned up, the question is whether it will age. Most of the signs say yes. It's gigantically rich in blackberries, cassis and chocolate, with a berried sweetness accented by the caramel of toasted oak. Acidity is just fine. On the other hand, the alcohol is notable, giving it peppery heat. A very fine, flashy, impressive wine, but its future is obscure.",Reserve,93,125.0,California,Sonoma-Napa,Napa-Sonoma,Claret,Pride Mountain
37219,Portugal,"The top of the range at Cortes de Cima and deservedly so. The wine is finely structured, with a feeling of restrained power.

37220,France,"Unusually for Châteaunuef-du-Pape, this wine is made up of 80% Syrah, with only 20% of the more typical Grenache. It's meaty and savory on the nose, blending those notes with cherries, leather, allspice and earth on the palate. Full but fresh, with a long finish. Drink now–2018.",Reserve,92,68.0,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine de Nalys

37222,Portugal,"From vineyards in the Douro Superior, this is a powerful wine showing its rugged terroir, with dark fruit and tannin, hints of wood aging and packed, concentrated flavors.

37223,Portugal,"In recorded existence since 1498, Quinta de Pancas produces wonderfully balanced wine.

37224,US,"Lots of richness in this Chardonnay, in the form of pineapples, pears, peaches, nectarines and golden mangoes. But you'll also find a firm minerality that grounds it, and supportive acidity, like a squirt of lime. Oak adds the final touch of vanilla and caramel.",Rosella's Vineyard,92,40.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Bernardus

37226,France,"The wood-aged Garrus seems a contradiction in terms when described as a Provence rosé. But taste it and it makes complete sense with its rich fruits, only the slightest hint of toast and sweet crushed strawberry flavors. It is rounded, smooth, impressive.",Garrus,92,90.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,,Rosé,Château d'Esclans
37227,Portugal,"Deep, black-colored wine, firm, serious and still young. It has power and concentration, dark berry fruits, herbal and spice flavors and a core of wood. This is a wine for long-term aging to soften the tannins.",Momentos,92,52.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Luis Soares Duarte

37229,US,"Biodynamically farmed, this young vineyard seems to improve with each new vintage. More and more you find an expression of soil details—delicate streaks of dried leaf, moist loam, a flavor of clay. The fruit is refined and perfectly ripe, without being fleshy.

37231,US,"Although there's no oak on this wine, it has a spicy smokiness that could come from a drop of Grenache. There are also percentages of Chardonnay and Pinot Gris that fatten Sauvignon's minerals and limes. Acidity is mouthwateringly high. This isn't a great wine, but it is a unique one, especially for Santa Rita Hills.",Estate Grown,87,18.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Babcock
37232,US,"Black pepper is the star of this bone-dry, full-bodied young wine, in both the aroma and the flavor. Below that are bold notes of black currants, plums and leather. The tannins are hard, giving it a mouth-stinging astringency. Your best bet is to cellar it for 3–4 years, but it's somewhat risky.",Rodney's Vineyard,87,45.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,Fess Parker
37233,Spain,"A bit earthy and leafy on the nose and palate, with lightweight strawberry and raspberry aromas and flavors. The wine has a clacky, almost metallic feel to it along with hints of tobacco and green bean. Vanilla and sweetness push the finish, which is also slightly green. Hails from Cádiz in southwestern Spain.",Finca Moncloa,87,35.0,Andalucia,Vino de la Tierra de Cádiz,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,González Byass
37234,US,"Very tough and tannic now, and dry too, so that the ultimate impact is disagreeably harsh. That, despite a solid core of blackberries, black currants, violets, bacon and minerals. The question is one of ageability. The answer is that it's a gamble, as the wine, like the stock market, could go either way.",Morehouse Vineyard,87,50.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Carr

37238,US,"Made in a wonderfully dry, crisp style, Sauvignon Blancs like this fill a much-needed niche in fruit-heavy California. It's zesty and minerally, with lemon, lime and grapefruit flavors.

37240,Italy,"Earthy aromas of white mushroom and dried roses that are characteristic of Tuscan Sangiovese are what you notice first here.

Fresh acidity and firm tannins suggest a pairing with red meat.",,87,,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Vasco Sassetti
37241,US,"Not very Chardonnay-like, more like a Viognier or Pinot Gris with its aromatic floral, tropical fruit, citrus, melon and spice aromas and flavors. Still, it's very tasty, and dry as well, with a crisp spine of minerally acidity.",,87,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Villa Andretti

37244,US,"Dark fruits characterize this young, vigorous wine. Black cherries, blackberries, even dark chocolate flood the palate, delicious and spicy. Yet there's a tannic, acidic tightness that makes the mouthfeel tough and gritty.

37245,US,"Lightly lemony, slightly waxy in the nose, with interesting details of green berries, yellow fruits and citrus oils, this wine sneaks up on you. It's lively and clean, with flavors much like a crisp, stainless steel-fermented Chardonnay.",,87,20.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Southern Oregon,Pinot Blanc,Torii Mor
37246,France,"A more weighty, mineral interpretation, with upfront red fruit that transitions to an edgy, pear-inflected palate with good concentration.

37247,US,"A bit soft and lacking in bright structure, which gives the complex blackberry, currant, dark chocolate, anise, herb and cedar flavors, good as they are, a collapsed mouthfeel. The softness seems likely to limit the wine's ageability.",Mario's Vineyard,87,50.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trinchero
37248,US,"Delicious in briary blackberry jam, cherry pie, currant, milk chocolate, black pepper and anise flavors, with a touch of sweet oak, and the finish is totally dry.

Good wine for the money.",Protocolo,87,7.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Rosé,Dominio de Eguren
37256,US,"A beautiful Chenin, among the best in California. Although it is dry, as the name suggests, and very crisp in acidity, it's so fruity it almost tastes off-dry.

37264,US,"This well-defined Cabernet offers blackberry, black cherry and a hint of sweet grape jam. It's set in a frame of rock and tannin, that seems to catch and hold as it enters the back of the throat. Perhaps an indication that more bottle age, or some hours of decanting, are in order? In any event, it stops a bit short.",Canoe Ridge Estate,88,28.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau Ste. Michelle
37265,US,"With the largest production in the entire Northwest, it is important that this wine express clean, varietal flavors with characteristic brightness and focus. And it does.

37267,US,"Shows the aggressive tannins that often mark this unruly variety, but that's part of the charm. It's a big, potent wine, muscular in blackberry, black currant, leather and black pepper flavors, and best of all it's dry without high alcohol.

37486,Chile,"This Casablanca SB opens with crisp, dry, capped aromas of ocean foam, citrus and green herbs. It's true to form in the mouth, with nice acidity and citrusy zest.

37488,Chile,"With floral aromas mixed with darker notes of asphalt, mineral, leather and berry fruit, this opens well. The palate is rubbery in feel but structured.

37490,Austria,"A big, round and soft wine, full of blackberry and plum fruits, rich and generous. It has warm tannins as well as touches of wood and a open, ripe aftertaste.

37493,Chile,"A jammy, grapey bouquet offers blueberry and spice aromas but not much complexity or nuance.

The oak influence is rich but subtle.",,89,40.0,California,Arroyo Seco,Central Coast,Grenache,Scratch
37495,Spain,"Light peach, apricot and buttercup aromas are better at first but lose steam with airing.
