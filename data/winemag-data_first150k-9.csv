99994,Chile,"Full-bodied, rich and packed with sweet fruit, Mingre signals that J. Bouchon is ready for prime time. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Carmenère and Syrah that tips the scales with heft and concentration. It's slightly herbal and warm, with a creamy, well-oaked palate and flavors of blackberry and black plum. Needs some time in bottle.",Mingre,91,40.0,Maule Valley,,,Red Blend,J. Bouchon
99995,US,"Black cherry and berry fruits are front and center, tannins are ripe but carry an herbal edge, and the time in barrels adds a chocolaty underpinning. The finish goes dark, with mocha, espresso, black olive and smoke, and the alcohol rests at a sensible 14.5%.",Morrison Lane,91,45.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,K Vintners
99996,US,"This estate-grown Chardonnay opens with lots of new oak aromas, excellent fruit material, with Meyer lemon, yellow apple, hints of white peach. The phenolics give the wine some excellent texture, and it has a long and smooth finish.",DuBrul Vineyard,91,50.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Côte Bonneville
99997,US,"A lovely Merlot, showing a French influence in its Bordeaux-like delicacy and earthiness. Feels elegant in the mouth, a supple, lightly oaked wine with layers of cherries, tobacco, cedar and sage. Good value.",,91,26.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Clos du Val
99998,US,"The acids in white wines of the 2008 vintage are superb; and the beautiful match of acids and sugars in many Washington Rieslings is nicely displayed here. The aromas are ripe and rich with a nice mix of floral, apple, stone fruit and light tropical fruit. Flavors evolve with pleasingly sweet hints of honey and tea; this feels like a wine that could age beautifully.",,91,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Riesling,Trust
99999,US,"Aromatic and lively, with honeysuckle, peach, apricot, apple and cinnamon pear scents. It's delicate and complex in the mouth; bone dry and yet carries a lovely sensation of sweet blossom.

100001,Italy,"This is a beautiful expression of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo that straddles a fine line between being traditional and modern. Natural fruit tones come through and are not overburdened by oak, although nice shadings of spice and vanilla do appear in the background.",Marina Cvetic,91,33.0,Central Italy,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,,Montepulciano,Masciarelli
100002,US,"Small amounts of Mourvèdre, Syrah, Counoise and Cinsault add complexity to this excellent Grenache, grown at the Ciel du Cheval vineyard on Red Mountain. Supple and aromatic, it expresses itself with ripe, sweet strawberry and black cherry fruit, whiffs of pepper and pencil lead, and a full-bodied midpalate that continues cleanly through a lingering finish.",,91,30.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Grenache,McCrea Cellars
100003,US,"Firm and compact, it mixes wild berry, plum and cassis fruits, giving this Cab-dominated blend the sleek appeal of a good St. Emilion, but without the aggressive herbaceousness. There is no obvious new oak here, but lovely suggestions of barrel that never override the superb fruit.",DuBrul Vineyard Carriage House Red,90,50.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Côte Bonneville
100004,US,"Great price for a Zin of this purity and varietal truth. Dry and medium-bodied, but sweet in fruit, it shows wonderful flavors of wild forest blackberries, with complications from black pepper, orange peel, anise and Asian spices. The texture is sheer velvet. Best now and through 2010.",,90,20.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Cline

100006,France,"This rich botrytized wine is certainly sweet. But the intense dry botrytis character is much more evident, with an edge of bitter honey, crushed brown sugar and tight, taut acidity. Put all this down to youth, because this potentially delicious wine needs aging for at least another five years.",Les Churelles de Juchepie,90,30.0,Loire Valley,Coteaux du Layon La Faye,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine de Juchepie
100007,US,"Old vine fruit from Sagemoor and Kiona blends with newer fruit from Ciel du Cheval. This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and it opens up slowly. Layered and complex, it mixes leaf, herb, and somewhat dusty tannins over tangy, tight, immaculate red fruits. Needs breathing time and more bottle age, but it's elegant and well-crafted.",Big Papa Old Vine,90,45.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Efeste
100008,US,"Sharp scents with a light hint of cardboard, piercing lemon oil and pineapple, minerality and lemon tea.

100009,Australia,"This blend of 63% Shiraz, 18% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot and 9% Cabernet Franc starts off with herbal, smoky, green-peppercorn aromas, but really rounds into shape on the palate, where it offers blueberry fruit and hints of maple syrup and vanilla.

100010,US,"This is 100% varietal, all Lewis vineyard fruit.

100011,Italy,Shardana is a joint venture between Sardinia's Cantina Santadi and importers Neil and Maria Empson.

100012,Italy,"This edition of Mater Matuta shows more sophistication and harmony and proves that this well-loved Syrah-Petit Verdot blend from Lazio benefits from two or three years of bottle aging. The wine is bold and ripe with raw fruit flavors and offers chewy, soft tannins on the close.",Mater Matuta,90,57.0,Central Italy,Lazio,,Red Blend,Casale del Giglio
100013,Australia,"This full-bodied, creamy-textured wine is a bit peppery and herbal but also filled with lush cherry fruit, making for a dynamic, engaging contrast.

100014,Italy,"This vintage of Rubesco Riserva exhibits beautiful elegance and linearity (compared to the hotter 2003) with bright aromas of black fruit, cherry, moist earth and spice.

100015,South Africa,"Full-bodied with juicy flavors of berry and plum underscored by smoke, spicebox and leather, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Merlot and Cabernet Franc has an ageable and elegant character whose slight rigidity will soften over time. Pair with grilled meats, robust cheeses.",Kadette,90,13.0,Stellenbosch,,,Red Blend,Kanonkop
100016,US,"Ripe berries, loaded with spice, concentrate the flavors of this exceptionally smooth, big-bodied Syrah. As is the custom with Sequel, the grapes are a blend of many vineyards and AVAs, which certainly enhances the polished mouthfeel, but at the expense of specificity. The acids stick out a little bit, but are soon covered in loads of chocolate and butterscotch barrel flavors. Drink soon.",,90,55.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Sequel
100017,US,"Drinks rather soft and pastry desserty now, with appealing flavors of blackberry tart, black cherry pie, anise, vanilla bean, mocha, cedar and cinnamon spice. Appealing for its direct lusciousness, but a little obvious, and could develop bottle bouquet and complexity after 2011.",,90,65.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Showket
100018,Italy,"Made with late-harvest Moscato grapes, this light amber dessert wine boasts evolved aromas of caramel, roasted chestnuts, honey and dried apricot.

100019,France,"Rich, creamy Chenin Blanc, with flavors of lime and yellow plums, with a vibrant acidity that gives freshness but also ripeness. Red currant flavors go along with a final juiciness. Showing delicious, mouthfilling, easy fruit, it is ready to drink now.",Les Noëls de Montbenault,90,,Loire Valley,Anjou,,Chenin Blanc,Richard Leroy
100020,France,"Deiss has brought quite a bit of flavor intensity to the often recalcitrant Pinot Blanc; Indian spices, browned apple, clove and petroleum are the themes here. Concentration is evident on the crisp palate, which finishes on a vanilla note.",Bergheim,88,35.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Blanc,Domaine Marcel Deiss
100021,France,"A unique wine for Alsace, this blend of Chardonnay and its kissing cousin, Pinot Auxerrois, is fashioned in a Burgundy style.

Drink now or hold a year or two for more complexity.",ZIND,88,36.0,Alsace,Alsace,,White Blend,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht
100022,Germany,"Elegant, though there's no shortage of density to these flavors. Membrillo, sour drops and apricot are the main themes, set against a mineral undertow. The palate is crisp and balanced though quite off-dry, winding down to a long, subtle finish of stone fruits. Great now, but will improve over the next few years.",Bernkasteler Doctor Spätlese,88,,Mosel,,,Riesling,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch)
100023,South Africa,"Herbs, pepper, cedar and smoked sausage on the nose and palate give this Cabernet a rustic, inviting character.

Good minerality and balance mean it's not overpowering for food.",Finlayson Family Vineyards,88,23.0,Stellenbosch,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Edgebaston
100024,Spain,"An oaky, modern-style wine with a staunch mocha and vanilla influence, but the fruit is ripe and rich enough to handle it. Spicy and grainy on the nose, with vanilla and resin seeping through. The palate remains woody but is full of berry flavors, while the omnipresent barrel influence carries onto the rich, ripe finish.",Crianza,88,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,El Coto
100025,US,"This captures the sense of place and commitment to elegance that characterize the pricier Evening Land Oregon Pinots. Tart, assertive, spicy and unrepentantly herbal, it's a delightful wine for near-term enjoyment.",,88,25.0,Oregon,Oregon,Oregon Other,Pinot Noir,Evening Land
100026,US,"Quite tart for a grape that usually is not known for its acidity, this sharp, spicy Syrah is loaded with concentrated cranberry and raspberry fruit. It would be a fine companion to roasted poultry, or pork with some sort of red fruit sauce.",,88,38.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Southern Oregon,Syrah,Griffin Creek
100027,Australia,"With 75% Shiraz, 22% Cabernet Franc and 3% Viognier, this wine stands out in a crowd. We get your expected plum and pepper notes from the Shiraz, but there are also elegant notes of cherry juice, pipe tobacco and tomato leaf along with a surprisingly firm acidity given the high level of ripeness. Tame tannins and leather notes come through on the finish. Drink now to 2013.",The Pretty Miss Shiraz-Cabernet Franc-Viognier,88,20.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Red Blend,Creed of Barossa
100028,Australia,"A fruit-forward nose belies the chewy tannins and more serious leather tones that come through in the mouth. Acidity stands out on the medium finish.

100029,Italy,"Here's a sophisticated and intense Franciacorta sparkler with a luminous golden color and seductive aromas of toasted bread, almonds, yellow fruit and pressed rose petal. The wine offers a thick, creamy mouthfeel with some sour fruit on the close.",Brut,88,20.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Chardonnay,Castelveder
100030,France,"There is definite richness in this wine, which benefits from the ripe style of 2005. You find sweet plums, soft tannins and delicious juiciness. The wine remains fruit-dominated, and could age for 2–3 years.",La Cloche de Cornemps,88,,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Supérieur,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château de Cornemps
100031,France,"This is white Bordeaux at its freshest, bursting with herbaceous flavors, very grassy. It does have some weight of green plum flesh and a creamy texture. Delicious.",,88,12.0,Bordeaux,Entre-Deux-Mers,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château de Fontenille
100032,US,"Ponzi makes very little Riesling, which is a shame, because this is a big, full-bodied, leesy, mineral-soaked mouthful of fresh, zesty flavor.

100033,Australia,"This blend seems to combine the best of the popular, fruity Shiraz with the more exotic, animal Mourvèdre grape. The palate shows only faint tannin and a few undertones of vanilla and coconut that glide through to the finish on a streak of acidity. An ideal choice for smoked meats. Drink now to 2012.",Bin 2 Shiraz-Mourvedre,88,15.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Red Blend,Penfolds
100034,South Africa,"Rich aromas of coffee, cinnamon, cedar and black berries lead into flavors of spice and savory berry in this versatile South African red.

100036,US,"Light and tannic, tart and tasting of just-ripe cranberry and mountain strawberries. There is some pretty spice in the nose, and this wine is ready for food.

Bring on the duck.",Tualatin Estate Vineyard,88,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley Vineyards
100037,US,"A big, heavy, full-bodied and ripe Zinfandel that needs rich, greasy meats and cheeses to tame it. The blackberry, currant and dry chocolate flavors are huge, and the tannins are even bigger, giving this extremely dry wine an astringent finish.",Tori's Reserve,88,44.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wilson

Will age without developing complexity.",Taylor Reserve,87,41.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dutcher Crossing
100040,US,"Cerise is Chehalem's version of a Passetoutgrains—80% Gamay Noir, 20% Pinot Noir. Youthful, tasting of berries and spice, it hints at leafy herbs also. It's a picnic wine—tangy and light, with cherries and raspberries, and finished at just 12.7% alcohol.",Cerise,87,24.0,Oregon,Ribbon Ridge,Willamette Valley,Red Blend,Chehalem
100041,US,"Lusty and fleshy, a fat, opulently flavored young Cab offering huge amounts of ripe Paso fruit.

100042,France,"Oxidative and spicy. Effusive mineral notes provide complexity but turn heavy in the mouth without fruit for balance. Crisp, with a silky texture and a short-to-medium finish.",Engelgarten Bergheim,87,40.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Alsace white blend,Domaine Marcel Deiss
100043,US,"Green melon and green apple fruit is lightly scented with aromas of white flowers and talc.

Faustini
100045,New Zealand,"Some slightly smoky, barrel-char aromas are subtle enough to allow rose-petal notes to slip through, backed by assertive flavors of cherries and toasty oak. This is a fairly full-bodied, spicy Pinot that pleases upfront before quickly slipping away.",,87,22.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Grove Mill
100046,US,"A good, dry, full-bodied Petite Sirah to enjoy with hearty fare, such as pizza or short ribs of beef. It shows a classically tannic structure, with flavors of dark berries, licorice, tobacco and spices, although it does not possess the ability to age.",,87,15.0,California,Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Petite Sirah,Guenoc
100047,France,"A wine that disdains the typical fruit profile, aromas here turn to vanilla, browned apple and savory Asian dishes. The palate has good weight and firm acidity but is a bit lacking in appealing flavor. Medium finish. Drink up.",Le Kottabe,87,32.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Josmeyer
100048,South Africa,"Soft, unfolding and approachable, this Syrah starts with aromas of cocoa, cinnamon and smoke, followed by red berries, pepper and cherry. A spicy finish gives it extra flair. A versatile wine with good South African character.",,87,10.0,Stellenbosch,,,Syrah,Bradgate

100050,France,A hint of wood is a good sign of the richness and balance of this wine. There is some dryness and tautness to go with its black cherry and plum-skin flavors. There is a big and bold fruity aftertaste.,Château de la Terrière,88,,Beaujolais,Beaujolais-Villages,,Gamay,Terroirs et Talents
100051,US,"Pinot Blanc doesn't have much of an identity in California, but a wine like this advances the cause. Imagine the richness of Chardonnay's peach and pineapple flavors. Add a nutty, hazelnut quality, and a tartness suggesting lime zest. That's what you get in this food-friendly, affordable wine.",Orsi Vineyard,88,18.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Blanc,Spot-On
100052,Italy,"Huge cherry intensity is backed by pretty almond and vanilla bean nuances that help shape a plush, international wine that doesn't stray too far from tradition either. The nose is gorgeous but the mouthfeel is highlighted by oak that blocks out some of the wine's natural freshness.",Riserva,88,,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Poggio Torselli
100053,South Africa,"A light, sophisticated nose of white flowers and citrus is followed by balanced fresh fruit and acid. The wine has a light touch but impresses with its elegant overall character. Pair with grilled fish or salads. A wine with poise and class.",The Winemaster's Reserve,88,10.0,Western Cape,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Nederburg
100054,Italy,"Made with Chianti Classico tradition in mind, this compelling Riserva has measured tones of blueberry, cherry, almond paste and root beer.

100059,US,"A good wine for its classic structure and deep, complex black currant and cocoa flavors. But it's pretty oaky and tannic, giving it a hard, resistant feeling despite being nearly four years in age. Could surprise with up to 6 years in the cellar.",,87,45.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Adobe Road
100060,New Zealand,"This is leaner and more citrusy than the majority of plump New Zealand Pinot Gris, but still offers plenty of interest. The apple and pear flavors are clean and precise, outlined by citrus and with a hint of stoniness on the finish.",,87,23.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Gris,Huia
100061,US,"Most of the grapes in this statewide blend came from Lodi and Paso Robles, and it has the character of a warm-climate Zin.

100064,US,"By calling it Fumé, instead of Sauvignon, Blanc, the winery telegraphs that the wine was aged in barrels. The wood has given a subtle, rich texture of smoky cream, while the yeast adds doughy notes to the citrus, fig and spice flavors.",,87,17.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Ferrari-Carano
100065,Italy,"Carpineto offers a uniquely floral Chianti Classico (90/10 Sangiovese and Canaiolo) with aromas that recall violets, lavender and sweet jasmine.

100068,Chile,"Aromas of wet clay, spice and soft black fruits carry the bouquet, while the palate is plump and easygoing, with mildly herbal cassis and black-fruit flavors.

100069,Chile,"Our reviews for this fruit-bomb of a Syrah have been consistent over the years. The wine is intense and grapy, and it gives your palate a pounding as it delivers boysenberry and other rich black-fruit flavors. Heavy oak treatment results in coffee and chocolate on the back end. Good in a muscular way, but would benefit from more refinement and structure.",Antu Mountain Vineyard,87,20.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Syrah,Ninquén
100070,Italy,"This is a simple and easy Moscadello—a traditional late-harvest dessert wine from Montalcino—that exhibits clean notes of apricot, honey and almonds.

The alcohol is quite high, but the wine feels rich and balanced.",Reserve Smith Orchard,87,40.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Mazzocco
100074,Italy,"This Riserva is measured in terms of its aromatic intensity and although it does deliver cherry, spice and warm notes of leather and almond, it does so in a very understated manner. The more you get to know it in the glass, the more you can identify delicate floral and ethereal aromas that point to a traditional Chianti Classico style. Sharp acidity and bright fruit flavors tell the same story in the mouth.",Riserva,87,22.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Piccini

100077,US,"This unoaked wine, made from the red-hot Austrian variety, is very dry and high in acidity.

100084,Spain,"This wine costs a lot for what it's giving. The nose starts out hard and fruitless, and while the aromas come around, the wine always holds onto its corn and haystack character. Zippy acidity gives the mouth zest, and it also livens up papaya, banana and apricot flavors.

100280,US,"This Syrah was grown in Carneros in the cool, long '05 vintage, which may explain its minty sharpness, despite the low case production level.

100342,Spain,"Sweet smelling, with a touch of pastry. Focused, lean and nice in the mouth, showing dry apple and citrus peel flavors. Solid Cava that brings a modicum of leesy, pithy richness on the finish.",Brut Reserva,87,18.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Sabartés
100343,Spain,"Jumps out of the chute with baked, earthy, funky aromas that are more savory and spicy than outright fruity. The palate has a good but limited mouthfeel, while the flavors of raspberry are spicy and saucy. Good in a subtle, earthy, nonfruity way.",Crianza Vendimia Seleccionada Finca Valdelayegua,87,19.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
100344,Spain,"Dark purple in color, with a jammy nose of berry fruit and coconut. The palate is concentrated, a little narrow and sharp in the center, with snappy, pointed cherry and berry flavors.

100345,US,"Westland is the second label of Methven Family Vineyards. This seems sure to be a popular wine—broadly fruity, lightly chocolaty, firmly tannic, yet clearly varietal. The fruit brings cherries and berries, rounded out nicely with chocolate and coconut flavors. The wine shows some astringent tannins and finishing earthiness.",Citizen's Cuvée,87,22.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Westland
100346,France,"Very smooth and soft, this is an interpretation of Bordeaux that left out the tannins. But the pleasure in this easy, ripe wine is there, the blackberry fruit rich and right up front.",Château Haut-Meneau La Victoire,87,20.0,Bordeaux,Premieres Côtes de Blaye,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Xavier Flouret
100347,Spain,"Comes across a bit baked, syrupy and sweet on the nose, with a hint of stalkiness and stem. The palate has a lush early feel, but further inspection unveils a hollow core. Flavors veer toward earthy raspberry, while the finish is chunky and properly reflects what came before it.",Reserva,87,40.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Viña Vilano
100348,France,"While it has the lightness of the vintage, the wine enjoys its freshness with bright acidity and red fruits. The tannins are well in balance, but not dominant.",Château de Musset,87,,Bordeaux,Lalande de Pomerol,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Yvon Mau
100349,France,"Opens with an attractive musk note, followed by guava, quince and pear. The palate shows moderate intensity and good freshness. Winds up with a graham cracker note on the finish.

100351,France,"An impressively rich Sancerre red, showing plenty of red berry fruits, tight tannins and balanced acidity.

100352,US,"Claiborne & Churchill continues to produce one of California's best Alsatian-style Rieslings. As the label suggests, the wine is bone dry despite very low alcohol.

100354,Italy,"Very typical of Chianti Classico, this feminine wine made by a boutique winery in Greve-in-Chianti offers elegance and harmony thanks to its remarkable intensity and refined aromas of cherry, blueberry, marzipan, root beer and violets. It leaves a thin, easy impression in the mouth with a fresh close.",,87,,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Castellinuzza e Piuca
100355,Chile,"Good Cab, maybe a touch herbal and light, but very solid. Early aromas of cola, leather and blackberry show some herbal, green notes. But the tomato leaf character is not dominant or unappealing, thus in the end this displays classic Chilean Cabernet qualities on a light, agile frame. Drink now.",La Porfia Grand Reserve,87,17.0,Rapel Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Botalcura
100356,US,"With its blast of briary, brambly wild berries and black pepper, this is a classic Zin. The lusty flavors range through blackberries and cherries and mulberries to cola and root beer. Despite the hefty tannins, it's ready now with grilled meats or pasta with tomato sauce.",,87,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Zinfandel,Bourassa Vineyards
100357,Italy,"You can tell by its thin but still very vibrant color that this is a traditional Chianti Classico (90/10 Sangiovese–Canaiolo) that puts emphasis on delicacy and balance, not on thick concentration. It is that quality that makes this wine well-suited to most Italian and Mediterranean dishes.",,87,26.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Badia a Coltibuono
100358,US,"This is a blend of Santa Rita Hills and Santa Maria Valley, made from some of the best vineyards in both appellations.

100361,Italy,"Thinner and more traditional in style and appearance, this Riserva has nice balsam- and almond-like intensity. These qualities make it a perfect companion to pork with glazed onions or vegetables au gratin. It's a bit thorny and nervous in the mouth—qualities that probably won't be appreciated by those seeking soft, dense flavors.",Riserva,87,,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Lamole di Lamole
100362,Australia,"Always difficult to evaluate young, Steingarten Rieslings typically take several years to even begin opening up and revealing their true charms. This one is bone-dry and medium-bodied, offering austere mineral and lime aromas and flavors. Cellaring through 2015 will undoubtedly be rewarded, and perhaps this rating will appear stingy at that time.",Steingarten,87,28.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Riesling,Jacob's Creek

100364,Chile,"Pretty on the nose, with mild apple and pear scents. The wine shows good balance and body, with flavors of pineapple, apple and green melon. It's got all the fruit you could ask for, but some of that fruit is of the sweet banana and plantain family. Which for some means too sweet.",,87,20.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Veranda
100365,Italy,"Tight mineral notes shape this wine and created extra dimension over what is a simple, genuine and fruity Chianti Classico. The wine offers chewy cherry, some chocolate notes and spicy acidity on the close.",,87,,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Villa Cerna

100368,US,"Reminiscent of a good southern French rosé, this blush of Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre and Cinsaut is dry, crisp and minerally.

100369,New Zealand,"Intensely perfumed, this is herbal but ripe, too, with fig and melon fruit aromas. It's boldly flavored in the same vein, with the only quibble being that it finishes a little short. A solid effort.",,87,18.0,Nelson,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Seifried
100370,Italy,"Forest berry, bramble or thickets add an interesting touch to this Chianti Classico that forms a base core of solid red fruit.

100379,US,"The vineyard is old, planted when Theodore Roosevelt was president, and the wine has very complicated flavors of wild fruits, dried herbs and peppery spices, dark chocolate, coffee, tobacco and minerals.

100383,Italy,"Dense and weighty, with an unusual collection of aromas and flavors, including cotton candy, mushroom and watermelon on the nose, followed by cinnamon on the palate.

100384,Italy,"An exceptional example of an underappreciated appellation, this Gattinara offers up a gorgeous nose of animal, leather and spice accented by high floral tones.

A nice kick of acidity on the finish means it can stand up to even the heaviest duck dishes.",Riserva,91,55.0,Piedmont,Gattinara,,Nebbiolo,Dessilani
100385,US,"Considerably riper than Baileyana's other Pinots. It shows in the richer, softer mouthfeel and deeper flavors. The red cherries veer toward blackberries, yet the texture remains silky and dry. New oak, as always, is judiciously applied.

100386,US,"This is the least costly of Baldacci's '06 Cabs, and is quite close in quality to the more expensive bottlings.

100387,Australia,"Dark and chocolaty in style, with hints of earth and espresso oozing in.

Quite good now and for a few years.",,91,30.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Decoy
100391,France,"A wine for further aging. The wood element is powerful, but then so is the rich, jammy fruit.

Keep for 2–3 years.",Optimum,91,21.0,Southwest France,Fronton,,Red Blend,Château Bellevue la Forêt

100396,US,"Dry and silky, a very proper Pinot Noir from this fine, cool vintage.

100398,Spain,"A serious, oak-influenced Godello with smooth aromas of baked apple, wood resin, vanilla, spice and green melon.

100399,US,"Very rich and ripe, with masses of cherries, red currants and mocha that finish thoroughly dry and spicy. Full-bodied, too, almost like Grenache. Quite good, but a bit ungainly in youth.

The palate offers depth and clarity, and the flavors of green fruits are good. Falls off on the finish, which seems flat compared to the rest of the wine.",,88,12.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Root:1
100426,Italy,"A small portion of Cabernet Sauvignon is added to this Sangiovese-based wine for extra density and thickness of texture. The wine's aromas recall blackberry, mature cherry, tobacco leaf and black pepper.",Vigna il Corto,87,,Tuscany,Colli della Toscana Centrale,,Sangiovese,Fattoria di Basciano
100427,Italy,"This Riserva Chianti Rufina is just about over its peak. Drink it fast while those dried aromas of rose petal, prune and dark plum remain. The wine feels dusty and compact in the mouth and what keeps it alive is the freshness of its natural acidity.",Poggio Gualtieri Riserva,87,43.0,Tuscany,Chianti Rufina,,Sangiovese,Fattoria di Grignano
100428,US,"Seductive on the nose with scents of darkly toasted oak, char and black cherry menthol, this is a rich, deeply concentrated Cab with a nice dose of complexity. It's a touch soft on entry, but smoke, supple tannins and a dark, toasty finish make this medium-bodied wine remarkably balanced.",,87,20.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau Lafayette Reneau
100429,France,"Finely dense wine, its tannins floating in the ripe black currant and plum fruits, leavened by roasted coffee. It is well structured, with plenty of acidity and juiciness as a contrast, leaving a mouthwatering aftertaste.",,87,15.0,Bordeaux,Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Leboscq
100430,France,"Although initially austere, the wine opens up to give firm, dry tannins and black berry juice fruits, balanced with tobacco. It is restrained at this stage, the fruit not quite bursting into life. Wait for 2–3 years.",,87,19.0,Bordeaux,Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Patache d'Aux
100431,Israel,"This is a lovely rosé that's an interesting blend of 74% Sangiovese, 14% Barbera and 12% Pinot Noir. Soft strawberry, white cherry and a touch of peach appear in the bouquet, with riper flavors of strawberry and cream laced with sweet spice developing in the mouth. Balanced and refreshing; drink now.",Kosher,87,15.0,Galilee,,,Rosé,Galil Mountain
100432,Israel,"Ripe red apple flesh dominates this wine, with accents of fresh pear, sweet citrus and softly toasted hazelnuts making subtle appearances throughout. Medium weight and balanced with lovely, delicate apple pie spice lingering on the finish.",Yarden Kosher,87,18.0,Galilee,,,Chardonnay,Golan Heights Winery
100433,Chile,"It's rare that a boxed wine scores this well, but truth be told: it's a nice, easy, clean and honest Chilean Sauvignon Blanc with citrus, green fruit aromas and flavors, and ample crispness and snap. Flavors of green pear, passion fruit and anise hint at complexity, while the mouthfeel is acidic, fresh and cleansing.",3 L,87,22.0,Central Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Gran Verano
100434,US,"Heady florals, honey and smoke mix languorously on the nose of this deeply concentrated, multifaceted dry Riesling from Fox Run. The palate is sultry with smoke and orange rinds, a dark minerality and lime acidity.",Dry,87,16.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Fox Run
100435,US,"OK, get this: a solid Pinot Noir from an emerging wine region with pretty and clean strawberry fruit… for $12. There is nothing to criticize here—it was even aged for nine months in all-new French oak barrels. The berry flavors have a creamy wrap, a suggestion of vanilla, a lick of cinnamon. All good.",,87,12.0,Washington,Columbia Gorge (WA),Washington Other,Pinot Noir,Blacksmith
100436,US,"A charming blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot concentrated with ripe black fruit and rustic notes of bramble, mint and dried herbs.

100437,US,"A very pleasant wine for drinking now. It shows cherry, blueberry, blackberry and mocha flavors, wrapped into finely ground, soft tannins, and the finish is thoroughly dry.

100440,Argentina,"Neutral for the most part, but this light-framed white slips in pear, orange and spice notes while maintaining a nice, juicy profile. Nothing more than a refreshing, lime-infused dandy. But what's wrong with that?",Elsa Bianchi,85,9.0,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Torrontés,Valentin Bianchi
100441,New Zealand,"A clean, fresh Chardonnay, with less weight and body than most Central Otago examples. Green apple and lime flavors seem a bit tart, just balanced out by hints of ripe melon.",Blair Gunn Block,85,18.0,Central Otago,,,Chardonnay,Sleeping Dogs
100442,US,"Despite the fancy name, this Cab is tannicly rustic. It shows pronounced blackberry and black currant flavors, but the tannins are fierce and drying, and the wine seems unlikely to age well, so drink now.",Wild Horse Peak Mountain Vineyards 4-Block Blend,85,28.0,California,Temecula,South Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,South Coast
100443,Chile,"The oak on this wine gives it a strong resin and cinnamon character. Along the way there's floral berry aromas, cherry and plum flavors, and finishing notes of root beer, chocolate and cough drops. A bit woody and tannic but it gets the job done.",Castillo de Molina Reserva,85,12.0,Cachapoal Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,San Pedro
100444,Italy,"Honey, peach, citrus and dried herbs comprise the nose of this simple Pinot Grigio. In appearance, the wine is almost transparent with a touch of gold and the mouthfeel is equally light and easy.

100446,Hungary,"The rich, spicy and savory nose evoke the food for which the country is known, and this wine would undoubtedly pair well with full-bodied, spiced meats and stews. Its full, spicy nose leads into dependable flavors of red berry, wooded spice and pepper, with a slightly bitter, smoked edge. Not a terribly complex wine, but solid and tasty nonetheless.",Cuvée Barrique,85,48.0,Villány,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Bock
100447,Chile,"Pungent and sharp, and that's exactly the style that Los Vascos has mastered in recent years. This wine tastes very much like a coastal, Casablanca Chardonnay yet it hails from Colchagua. The nose is pithy and citric, and the palate is more of the same. Good mouthfeel and fresh, but green, citrusy and too much like Sauvignon Blanc.",Los Vascos,85,12.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Chardonnay,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite)
100448,New Zealand,"Roy's Hill is this respected winery's second label, offering lighter, less concentrated versions of the Pask wines. Coffee and chocolate accents mark this wine's smooth cherry fruit. Drink now.",Roy's Hill,85,14.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Merlot,CJ Pask
100449,Chile,"A simple, racy wine that's not designed to blow anyone away. The raspberry and cherry aromas are perfectly fine.

100452,Italy,"This Pinot Grigio is a bit more fragrant and floral in essence with aromas of stone fruit and peach blossom.

100453,US,"A blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with a splash of Cabernet Sauvignon, this tannic, dry wine has flavors of cherries, vanilla and smoky oak. It may develop some additional complexities over time.",Trompettes,85,65.0,California,Mount Veeder,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Rubissow
100454,Italy,"Besides the usual notes of citrus, pear and peach usually associated with Pinot Grigio, this expression offers added dimension in the form of roasted almonds. It has a creamy, honey-rich nose backed by chewy sweetness and refreshing zest. It's nice to see more screwcaps from Italy, especially on these light, easy wines.",,85,9.0,Northeastern Italy,Delle Venezie,,Pinot Grigio,Villa Pozzi
100455,New Zealand,"It's a bit simple and a bit soft, but this value-priced wine accomplishes its mission of bringing authentic Marlborough SB flavor to the U.S. at an affordable price. Gooseberry and lime flavors are touched with hints of honey and mint, finishing with a bit of sweetness.",,85,10.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Monkey Bay
100456,Australia,"Could this big-boned wine still be tight a few years after the vintage? Or is it just not that impressive? Lime and petrol notes dominate the wine, which finishes dry and tart.",,85,28.0,Victoria,Bendigo,,Riesling,Lamont
100457,Italy,"This Sauvignon is lean in appearance and offers a dim golden color backed by pretty aromas of kiwi, passion fruit, mango and fresh herbs. The nose lacks the sharp highlights usually associated with the variety and is instead flatter, wider and creamier in approach.",,85,16.0,Northeastern Italy,Collio,,Sauvignon,Ronco Blanchis
100458,US,"Not quite as rich and balanced as in past vintages, the 2004 is a bit ordinary in blackberry and cherry flavors. The tannins are fairly powerful, and the wine, which clocks in at over 15% alcohol, feels hot and peppery.",La Maestra,85,50.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ruston
100459,Chile,"Citrus pith, peach pit and other largely neutral aromas define the nose. The palate is soft and a touch flat, with ripe, nonsheering peach and citrus flavors. Midlevel Chilean SB in every way, shape and form. Imported by Racke USA.",,85,11.0,Central Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Espiritu de Chile

100461,New Zealand,"Shows plenty of weight on the palate, but also an overall lack of intensity to its slightly vegetal—green pea—flavors. Still, there's enough passion fruit and grapefruit to provide a sense of balance and a crisp, clean finish.",Arona,85,11.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Barker's Marque
100462,New Zealand,"Offers herb, cranberry and cherry aromas upfront, followed by a medium-bodied palate that's cedary and herbal, but also shows some chunky cherry fruit. Finishes on oaky notes of coffee and chocolate.",,85,23.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Konrad
100463,US,"Tastes just like a cherry coke, with the heat of alcohol and smoky spice of oak. That's a pleasant, even complex mélange of flavors, even though the structure is simple and direct.",Reserve,85,16.0,California,Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Merlot,Wildhurst
100464,US,"Crisp and on the sweet side, this PG has flavors of honey, lemons, limes, green apples, figs and peppery spices. Nice as a cocktail sipper. Try with Chinese food for something different.",,85,14.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Gris,Balletto
100465,US,"The straightforward Cabernet fruit is immersed in new oak, so the dominant flavors of smoke, toast, chocolate and espresso all seem to emanate from the barrel aging. Otherwise it is a simple and perfectly pleasant, no-frills red.",Pheasant Run Vineyard,85,36.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Basel Cellars
100466,US,"The vineyard is on Howell Mountain. It's an awkward wine, with lots to like, but some problems. On the plus side is enormous  cassis, cherry and chocolate fruit flavor and rich, fine tannins, and the 100% new oak seems proper given the wine's volume. But there's too much sugary sweetness in the finish, almost like a dessert wine.",Bancroft Ranch Vineyard,85,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Beringer
100467,Argentina,"Earthy and seemingly on the edge of being overripe, this is a wine that deals dark-fruit flavors, a milky, malty underlay, and a fairly sound mouthfeel. Ample tannins and resiny, peppery afternotes re-announce any previously detected oak, and like many wines from this vintage it's overly expressive.",Reserva,85,18.0,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Luigi Bosca
100468,US,"Ripe and simple, with flavors of black currants, sweet olive tapenade and mocha. It's a clean, pleasant wine to wash down meats and cheeses and not worry about impressing the neighbors.",,85,18.0,California,El Dorado,Sierra Foothills,Cabernet Sauvignon,Madroña
100469,Chile,"Bold and red on the nose, with only mild herbal aromas. That slight herbal character extends to the palate, where red plum and red currant flavors take over. With adequate size and plenty of fuel in the tank, this is no wallflower of a wine. But it is a bit limited and tangy, and the acidity seems amplified.",Hacienda Araucano,85,11.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Carmenère,J. & F. Lurton
100470,Chile,"The bouquet shows pure, nicely extracted blackberry and leather aromas. The palate is healthy and structured, with blackberry, toast and mild herb flavors.

100474,France,"Notes of toasted apple skins, wood-grilled peaches, lightly dried grass and sweet spices lead the nose of this attractive white and continue through onto the medium-weight palate. It is ripe and fruit-forward, with rounded flavors of melon, pear and apple flesh, but it's all lifted by marked, brisk acidity that keeps the finish simultaneously bright and long. Drink now–2015.",Brama,91,42.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Minervois La Liviniere,,Grenache Gris,Château Maris

100476,France,"This beautifully fragrant offering is definitely on the dry side. It has a crisp apple flavor, accompanied by a citrus note and taut minerality. This nervy, feather-light wine is better fit for food than as an apéritif. Still young, it could age for several more years.",Ivoire et Ebène Brut,91,65.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Aubry
100477,Italy,"There are subtle floral elements here of yellow rose and jasmine that give this a feminine and elegant personality. But the wine has substance and staying power, too, in its flavors of stone fruit, melon and toasted nut.

100485,US,"With vigorous blackberry, black currant, dark chocolate and oak flavors, this wine certainly tastes young.

100486,Portugal,"A joint venture between the Bergqvists of Quinta de la Rosa and winemaker Jorge Moreiro in the Douro Superior has produced this impressive, deeply rich offering.

100693,Italy,"I Quaranta has succeeded in fashioning a thoroughly modern, lush style of wine from an eclectic blend of 60% Barbera and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon. Hints of mocha back up dense plum and strawberry fruit on the nose which give way to a refined palate showcasing highly polished tannins. A final kick of acidity adds freshness to the deep chocolate and cassis flavors that linger on the finish.",Velours,90,,Piedmont,Monferrato,,Red Blend,I Quaranta
100694,France,"With additions of Tannat and Merlot to the 75% Malbec, this is the main wine from the estate of Jean-Luc Baldès. It is powerful, dark and dense, a proper tribute to the Malbec grape, with its dry tannins at the center of the black fig, spice and bitter coffee flavors. Worth aging for 2-3 years, but drinkable now with rich food.",Clos Triguedina,90,,Southwest France,Cahors,,Red Blend,Jean-Luc Baldès
100695,Australia,"Hunter Valley Shiraz is somewhat out of fashion here in the U.S., but this is an excellent example of the genre, one that can be taken home and enjoyed tonight.

100697,Australia,"A terrific value, Plantagenet's 2006 Hazard Hill Shiraz is a silky, feminine-styled Shiraz that starts with smoky, slightly floral notes, then adds in peppery spice, delicate red berries and just a hint of chocolate before leaving your mouth watering on the finish. Drink now.",Hazard Hill,90,13.0,Western Australia,Western Australia,,Shiraz,Plantagenet
100698,Australia,"Like most Tapestry offerings, this wine shows plenty of cedary and cinnamon-like oak, but the soft plum and blackberry fruit serve to provide balance.

100699,US,"Delicious and succulent, a gigantic Zinfandel. Impresses for the powerful ripeness of the blackberry, plum and cherry fruit, accented with waves of smoky wood, cocoa and Asian spices.

100700,Spain,"Full, earthy and ripe, but also delivering alot of clean fruit, size and balance.

100703,US,"This seems to be a bottling of some of the best blocks from the winery's Firepeak estate vineyard.

100704,Australia,"Truth be told, the difference in quality between this wine and the $125 Graveyard Vineyard bottling doesn't appear that great, so savvy consumers should jump on this Shiraz, which offers leather, coffee and roasted meat complexity allied to medium body, a creamy texture and a long, firmly structured finish.

100706,Argentina,"Purple in color, with ripe, meaty, earthy aromas mixed with herbs, exotic berry fruit scents and vanilla. This is feisty and full-bodied Pinot with integrated plum, blueberry and well-applied oak.

100873,US,"This is Claar's Bordeaux blend. Despite the extra bottle age, the wine is   still stiff and tannic.

100887,Argentina,"Burnt popcorn and some ammonia make the nose fairly harsh. Time softens it a bit as it yields to green-fruit flavors. Finishes dry as a soda cracker, with some Old World touches.

100888,Argentina,"Big and spicy at first, and then vegetal, lesser characteristics seep in and take over.

100898,US,"This is deeply saturated, lush, scented with violets, raisins and chocolate, still tight and spicy. Excellent depth and structure, with about one quarter of the oak new.

100899,Chile,"Solid, juicy Cabernet that has a lot of fresh berry and black cherry on the nose. The mouth is forward and fruity, with slick plum, berry and cherry flavors.

100909,US,"The Chelan region is Washington's newest AVA, but already showing great potential for Syrah, as this aromatic and explosively flavorful bottle proves. Ripe berries, plums and cherries are swept into a mix of smoke and rock and iron filings; as you taste through the wine there are citrusy acids and hints of resin and tar; it just keeps adding in the nuances.",Defiance Vineyard Estate,90,27.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Nefarious Cellars

100914,France,"A floral wine, dominated by apple blossom and baked apple flavors. It may be dry, but it is deliciously soft, its fruits very forward at this stage, only just edged with a grapefruit acidity.

100916,Chile,"New World Cabernet Franc with none of France's leafiness but a whole lot of ribald black fruit.

100920,Spain,"Slightly more leafy, herbal and burnt on the nose than ideal, but there's also tobacco, cherry and earth notes to keep it proper.

100921,Spain,"Raisiny, sweet and baked, with plenty of oak coming on as it airs out. This vintage is somewhat syrupy and strained compared to prior years, with baked black fruit flavors.

100930,Spain,"Solid, big and fruity, which is basically what a Campo de Borja Garnacha should be. Sweet red fruits and robust kick define the palate, which is tannic but not obtrusively so.

100936,France,"A wine that initially seems smothered in wood. Only slowly do the blackberry fruits and fresh acidity come through, and even then the toast, and a green edge, are dominant. Maybe a year's extra aging will help.",,87,,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Jean-Faure

100941,Italy,"Masottina's Brut Prosecco is an easy and forthcoming sparkling wine with a light but crisp mouthfeel and drying aromas of mineral, stone fruit and white flower.

100943,New Zealand,"Smoky, cedary and, frankly, a bit dominated by oak. It's nice oak, and the fruit is rich in body and thick in texture, just slightly muted.

100944,US,"This is a pretty good Cabernet, although it's a little direct in its appeal.

100946,Spain,"Opens with peach and apple aromas that are 100% normal, while the palate has a chiseled clarity to it that's crisp and appreciated.

100952,Chile,"A bit rubbery at first, with dark tar and other hard-coated aromas. Airing reveals cherry, cassis and slightly herbal flavors, while the finish is all about wavy coffee and mocha notes.

100964,Chile,"Despite some unyielding oak on the nose, this wine is juicy and good. It has a light, fast feel to it but also some serious tannins that bring the clamp down toward the finish.

Brims with pineapple tart filling, Key lime pie, orange zest, honeysuckle, daffodil and smoky, vanilla-oak flavors, with a creamy, yeasty richness.

101052,Argentina,"Far less ripe and appealing than the 2004 version. The '05 comes out of the chute smelling malty and lactic; airing reveals strawberry milk notes, while the flavors struggle to express themselves. Sticky, oily and as if someone hit the mute button along the way.

101054,US,"Too ripe for balance or longevity, the blackberry and currant flavors in this Cab veer into raisins, with a bitter finish.

101055,US,"Patianna's 2003 bottling of this organic wine was terrific. This currant 2004 is less so.

101056,US,"Lots of upfront fruit in this crisp, silky wine. It's one-dimensional, but for the price, a pretty good value in a Pinot Noir from a top appellation. The cherry, cola and currant flavors are complexed with smoky oak.",,84,14.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Mountain View

101063,Italy,"Montefalco Rosso is the less austere cousin of Sagrantino di Montefalco and although this blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino and Cabernet Sauvignon offers all kinds of spice, cherry notes and firm tannins, it is too masked by heavy oak tones.

101111,Chile,"Rich, roasted and defined by rugged black fruit and black olive aromas. Nice acidity renders it fit as opposed to heavy and overextracted.

101237,Spain,"Nice for a standard, no-frills type of Rioja. The cherry and raspberry aromas are sweet and clean, while the palate is juicy, fresh and tastes of ripe cherry, berry, vanilla and cream. Offers good clarity, power and depth given its price point.",Crianza,87,8.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Rivarey

101252,Australia,"From its slight tinge of copper this wine appears to have had some skin contact, and perhaps that can account for it's almost Pinot Noir-like aromas of strawberries and sous bois.

101266,US,"Those used to the fabulous richness of Ed Sbragia's Chardonnays at Beringer might find this disappointing. It's a good wine, with the Burgundian formula of half-barrel fermention in new oak, malolactic fermentation and weekly lees stirring, so it has those winemaker-added notes of creamy, yeasty smokiness. Yet the underlying pear and apple flavors are a little thin.",Home Ranch,86,26.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sbragia

101273,Chile,"A ton of oak aromas hit with force: there's butterscotch, mocha and caramel leading the pack.

Drink up.",La Morosa,89,,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Pier
101291,Italy,"We are big fans of Mauro Sebaste but found this vintage of his base Barolo to be slightly less charged and intense than previous years.

It's sheering, which is normal for the Graciano variety, but it also tastes nice while delivering a bolt of raspberry and red plum flavor.

The flavors are of cherries, raspberries, currants and cola, with nuances of licorice and gingerbread, yet for all that the finish is totally dry. So powerful is the wine in itself that it easily shoulders the 100% new French oak, which pushes the richness into a smoky, ne plus ultra territory.

101479,US,"A dramatic young wine, fleshy and dazzling now for its lush fruit and oak, although the tannins have a crunchy hardness. But that merely ensures ageability. It's beautiful the way the acid-tannin structure plays against the cherry, cassis and olive fruit, creating an architectural tension. If you open this wine now, decant for a few hours. Otherwise, it should hold for six to eight years, and develop further bottle complexity afterward.",,95,125.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Quintessa

101483,US,"Ten is Sea Smoke's biggest Pinot, a barrel selection chosen for sheer volume. It easily handles its 100% new oak coating.

101487,US,"This is the best Potelle Syrah I've ever had, but be forewarned: It's an extraordinarily tannic wine that shows its 1,800-foot mountain origins. It clocks in at 13.9% alcohol, yet it's bone dry. The fruit is powerfully concentrated in blackberries enhanced with sweet, smoky oak. If ever there was a Syrah for the cellar, this is it.

But it tails off quickly, fading gently into simple strawberry and cherry flavors, accented with the flavors of French oak, 60% new.",Red Wine,89,45.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Saggi
101499,South Africa,"Gooseberry, citrus and green pepper lead on this full-bodied white from Morgenhof. On the palate, round flavors of gooseberry and lemon are lifted by a crisp acidity, though the wine is generally bigger than it is fresh. A serious Sauvignon Blanc that can be sipped alone or with spicy cuisine, seafood.",Estate,89,19.0,Simonsberg-Stellenbosch,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Morgenhof
101500,Italy,Villa di Chiesa is a sophisticated 50-50 blend of Vermentino and Chardonnay that remains in contact with the lees and is fermented in oak for a generous and creamy feel in the mouth. The wine boasts bright notes of exotic fruit and fresh peach backed by vanilla and almond.,Villa di Chiesa,89,40.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Valli di Porto Pino,,White Blend,Cantina Santadi
101501,France,"A great rich waft of wood and peach sets the scene for a powerful, concentrated wine, its flavors of spice, yellow fruits and roasted peanuts enhanced by a slice of toast, butter, the acidity cutting right through everything. If there is a fault, it is the suggestion of heat, which comes from the alcohol.",,89,17.0,Loire Valley,Savennières,,Chenin Blanc,Château de Varennes
101502,New Zealand,"While the leafy, nettley notes provide Sauvignon's trademark herbaceousness, this wine's ample weight and slightly creamy texture provide a gentler counterpoint that should make the wine exceptionally versatile at the table. Grapefruit flavors finish long, with gentle herbal overtones.",Te Muna Road Vineyard Single Vineyard,89,26.0,Martinborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Craggy Range
101503,South Africa,"This single-vineyard Shiraz from Fairview has both pluck and poise. The nose offers red fruit, spice and a touch of flowers. On the palate, rich, upfront red berry flavors are balanced with minerality, acid and a nutty oak spin. Good, long finish.",Eenzaamheid,89,36.0,Paarl,,,Shiraz,Fairview
101504,Chile,"Perfectly ripe, with hints of raisin, licorice and blackberry on the nose. So mature and ready that it has sweetness, but it's natural and offset by a backbone of fine tannins.

101505,France,"It's worth noting the sec (dry) note on the label, because this is bone-dry Chenin. It does, though, have enough richness to bring a fine balance, with crisp apples, a mineral and steel character, and a taut-as-a-string texture. Drink now, or age for 2–3 years.",Sec,89,18.0,Loire Valley,Vouvray,,Chenin Blanc,Laurent Kraft
101506,US,"This is a big, mouth-filling Pinot Noir, stuffed with candy and pie-filling flavors.

Could develop for a few years.",,89,33.0,California,Marin County,North Coast,Pinot Noir,Kendric

It is crisp, but the green fruits are rounded out and given greater flavor by red apple juice, a tight texture and vivid finishing acidity.",,89,21.0,Loire Valley,Menetou-Salon,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Alain Assadet
101508,Chile,"Big and ripe, with inviting aromas of cola, mint, dark chocolate and black fruit. The feel and flow on the wine are just right, while the blackberry and chocolate chip-mint flavors are tasty and even a bit complex.

101509,US,"Lovely purple fruits, with clean flavors of cranberry, raspberry and wild cherry, and an underpinning suggesting metal filings.

101512,US,"This is 100% varietal and, most unusually for Klipsun, finished at just 13.2% alcohol.

101514,US,"Sourced from McClellan Estate vineyard, this excellent effort is balanced and juicy, bursting with boysenberry and cassis.

Uncomplicated and enjoyable.",Ecclestone,89,20.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,White Blend,Tangent
101517,Chile,"A snappy, ageworthy Carignan from 58-year-old vines. Fresh as can be, with dynamic red-fruit flavors coming on top of earthy, mineral-laden aromas. Firm to the point of being sharp, but then it dials back to show a mellower side. Could age for a decade or more due to its acid level and structure. A true old-vines winner.",Edicion Limitada,89,22.0,Loncomilla Valley,,,Carignan,Morandé
101518,US,"Upland Vineyards, the largest planting on the new Snipes Mountain AVA, provided the grapes for this dark, dense, smoky/inky Malbec. Fruit flavors are pinpoint wild berry and cassis, but what really anchors the wine are the darkly flavorful tannins, a mix of bitter chocolate, smoky espresso, and coffee grounds. This is not a wine that tries to seduce you; it's for serious steak eaters.",,89,28.0,Washington,Snipes Mountain,Columbia Valley,Malbec,Nefarious Cellars
101519,US,"The naturally peppery spice of the Carmenère has been blended down. The result is a wine loaded with blackberry and black cherry fruit, and still plenty of pepper.

101522,Spain,"Opens with unique, abnormal aromas of spiced fruit, cardamom and nutmeg.

101527,US,"This reserve is the best of Kason's 2007 releases, with cranberry fruit, minty spice, moderate tannins and overall balance. The thinness of the vintage shows through, and this will need to be drunk now, rather than cellared.

101534,Spain,"Not even El Bosque could escape the difficulties of the cool, extended 2007 vintage. While typically dark and bulky on the nose, it's also dull by Bosque standards, with oaky mocha and coffee stepping in as filler. The body is drawn and tannic, with oak, resin and dark berry flavors. Finishes resiny as well. By no means bad, but given Bosque's precedent it's not stellar.",Finca El Bosque,87,163.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
101535,US,"Lots of acidity in this very dry, somewhat austere young Pinot Noir. That sharp bite is relieved by fruity flavors of raspberries, cherries and cola, not to mention sweet oak.

101550,Italy,"This is an easy, fruit-forward wine that would pair well with family dinners and simple pasta dishes.

101560,Chile,"A warm, uncomplicated wine. The nose delivers oak and aromas of balsamic dressing, pencil shavings and chunky blackberry. Chunky is also the best way to describe the palate, which emphasizes blackberry, cherry and plum.

101564,Australia,"This starts off a little reductive, with tarry, burnt-rubber aromas that are frankly offputting.

101567,US,"The alcohol level on this single-vineyard Syrah is a little too high, resulting in a glyceriney sweetness that gives the blackberry, currant and cherry flavors a sugared pie-filling, almost dessert wine quality. Rich tannins and crisp acids help restore balance.",Clover Creek Vineyard,86,32.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Longoria
101568,US,"Like Pinot Noir, Tempranillo is a tempermental, unforgiving variety. This '05 is ripe, and offers baked cherry pie, currant, vanilla and cedar-mint flavors.

Best to drink soon.",Reserva,86,14.0,Central Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Valdivieso
101579,Chile,"The color and aromas are true to both Pinot Noir and Chile's Pinot-friendly Casablanca Valley. Dried fruit, citrus and pie cherry aromas take it toward a potpourri of red-fruit flavors. The only weakness is that the feel is a bit choppy and the finish goes heavy on the toast and woodspice.

101583,France,"A rich, juicy, super-ripe wine, the fruit a powerhouse of dark flavors.

101585,Australia,"Leeuwin Estate hits the spot with its 2006 Siblings Shiraz, tailored for immediate consumption. It delivers bold aromas and flavors of cracked peppercorns and black cherries in a medium-bodied format framed by supple tannins that turn slightly dusty on the finish. Drink it over the next few years.",Siblings,89,20.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Shiraz,Leeuwin Estate
101586,Spain,"Opens with floral, blueberry aromas, mineral notes and a spot of jammy candy. The palate is alert and well balanced, with grab and juicy flavors of raspberry and plum offset by a wave of buttery oak. Textured, full and satisfying on the finish. Very nice wine.",Crianza,89,27.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto Fino,Legaris
101587,Italy,"A serious contender with sophisticated notes of leather, barnyard and cedar wrapped up in toasty vanilla oak. A hint of char adds an edge to a streamlined palate infused with earth, mushroom and strawberry tones. A slight lack of persistence takes it out of the top flight. Fully mature, drink now.",Amistà,89,33.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,,Barbera,Massimiliano Vivalda
101588,Australia,"Starts off with deep, dark aromas of chocolate, licorice, cola and plum, then offers flavors of dates, chocolate and vanilla that fan out across the palate.

101589,US,"Made in the crisp, lighter-bodied way that is Edna Valley Pinot Noir, this is an elegant wine to drink now and for a year or two. It has an angular structure housing cool-climate flavors of cherries, cola, herbs and sweet, smoky sandalwood.",El Pico,89,33.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Baileyana
101590,Australia,"Like Spinal Tap, this wine turns the volume up to 11, packing in enough blueberry jam for breakfast on the Queen Mary II and enough cedary oak to build 100 saunas. It's undeniably powerful and intense, and embued with a lush, creamy texture; the only question is how it will evolve. Drink it now and stand your hair on end.",H.D. II,89,95.0,Victoria,Heathcote,,Shiraz,Heathcote Estate
101591,Australia,"Marked by fragrant plum aromas, this silky-textured wine adds cherries, anise and vanilla to the mix on the palate. It's medium in body, but round, with a long, complex finish.

101596,Australia,"De Bortoli winemaker Stephen Webber operates on a somewhat contrarian level, so this is not a soft cuddly Shiraz-Viognier loaded with apricot notes. Instead, it features savory, meaty aromas lifted by peppery elements and black olive, espresso and tart plum flavors. It's medium-bodied, firmly structured, and should age through at least 2020.",Estate Grown,89,36.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,Shiraz-Viognier,De Bortoli
101597,US,"A really nice, dry wine that stimulates the mouth with crisp acidity, then offers waves of interesting, complex flavors.

Drink now through 2012.",Cosme Palacio y Hermanos Reserva,89,30.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
101599,US,"A very nice Syrah that shows plenty of upscale character.

101600,Argentina,"Opens with warm, woody aromas that fold in molasses and maple along with mildly baked berry fruit.

Buttery notes and toffee warm the finish, which keeps its poise.",Q,89,20.0,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Malbec,Zuccardi
101601,Italy,"The heat-laden 2003 vintage has given this wine a more approachable acid and tannin structure than your average Barolo, but also a quirky collection of aromas, including tomato skin, fresh kindling and fried green tomatoes. Fruit spiciness and dusty rose notes weave through the fairly long finish. Drink or hold five years.",,89,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,San Biagio

101605,Argentina,"Aromas of rose hips, tomato leaf, raisin and black cherry get this fuller-bodied Pinot going on its way to a chunky palate of ripe raspberry, plum and creamy oak.

101607,Italy,"Made in a more oxidative (Piedmont-like) style than is typical for most Pinot Noirs, with high-toned notes of burnt cherries and citronella.

Drink as soon as possible.",,89,11.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Montespina
101609,Argentina,"Round and saturated on the nose, with a baked, syrupy set of dark-fruit aromas. The palate is plump but offers proper acidity, and thus the flavors of cola, mocha and blackberry are round but balanced. Buttery oak comes up on the finish, and overall this is a tasty but somewhat regular high-end Malbec (with 34% Tempranillo).",Zeta,89,45.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec-Tempranillo,Zuccardi
101610,Italy,"Piccini offers good value deals from Tuscany and this Riserva Chianti Classico follows in that tradition.

101611,Spain,"Maybe it's the Viura, becuase this $9 wine seems cleaner, rounder and slightly better than the winery's higher-priced pure Verdejos.

101618,Spain,"Earthy and baked on the nose, with rubber, black fruits and warm, almost burnt leather notes. The palate has a lively, dense mouthfeel and flavors of earthy berry fruits and raisin.

101620,US,"Savory on the nose with modest apple and pear aromas accented by a curious smoked ham note, this smoky off-dry Riesling with a touch of honeycrisp apple sweetness has a briney, umami-laden complexity that would make it an interesting companion to prosciutto wrapped around morsels of melons and fig.",Dry,87,18.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Bellangelo
101621,Spain,"Minerally, dry and clean white wine made from 60% Xarello and 40% Chardonnay.

101631,US,"A pleasing Albarino from a new Lodi producer and longtime grower family, this wine has an inviting flowery nose and sharpness of acidity with good follow-through, as well as nice tropical fruit flavors.

101638,Spain,"Dark and heavily oaked, so if you're into big wines with char, bacon and a lot of spice, this is it...and it's only $14.

101645,Chile,"A tart specimen with a lip-smacking, acidic feel. This has all the hallmarks of cool Casablanca, meaning it's sharp and choppy as opposed to lush and deep.

The wine needs to age for at least three years.",Quinta do Encontro Q do E,90,,Bairrada,,,Portuguese Red,Dão Sul
101696,US,"Similar to the 2009 vintage, which was another cool year, this single-vineyard offering is bone dry and strong in tannins, with a complex austerity. It shows tobacco, balsam and tamari notes alongside hints of raspberry and blackberry. It needs rich, complex meat stews or pasta dishes with tomato, garlic and lots of cheese in order to balance the wine's tannins and acids, and to coax out the sweetness.",Florence Vineyard,90,35.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dashe Cellars

101703,US,"Made from the Happy Canyon area, this Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux blend has good blackberry, cherry, currant, cocoa and cedar flavors, and is dry and richly tannic.

101707,US,"Shows the challenges of the 2008 vintage, which was alternately cool, hot and rainy in the North Coast. The wine is very dry and quite acidic.

101712,Italy,"Here is a distinctive interpretation of Barbera with candy-like aromas of cherry and raspberry followed by sweet spice and fruit cola.

101716,US,"Grown at a high altitude above Alexander Valley, this Merlot shows dense, hard mountain tannins that lock it down in astringency. The question with such wines always is, will it age? In this case, despite a rich core of cherries and blackberries, it's doubtful. The wine is so unusually tough that the tannins seem likely to outlive the fruit.",Lost Pine,87,65.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Stonestreet
101717,Chile,"If you don't mind a bit of herbal character, this is a nice, easy drinking Syrah with raspberry and cherry aromas and timidity as opposed to a forceful attack. Zesty berry fruit rules the palate, which finishes in round, roasted form. Nice but sort of generic.",,87,8.0,Rapel Valley,,,Syrah,Rayun

101767,Spain,"Ultra concentrated and sticky, with unctuous but wholesome raisin aromas taken to a level that's almost heavenly. In the mouth, the maple, cinnamon and brown sugar flavors are lusty and satisfying, and the finish never ends. This is P.X. in awesome form.",Don PX,93,29.0,Andalucia,Montilla-Moriles,,Pedro Ximénez,"Bodegas Toro Albala, SL"
101768,Portugal,"The white and red Pêra-Manca are cult wines in Portugal, only released in the best years. The white has partial barrel fermentation, giving great richness and depth of flavor, as well as smooth toastiness. With its high proportion of Antâo Vaz, it is very white Burgundy in its richness and sense of mineral terroir. Delicious acidity rounds the wine out.",Pêra-Manca,93,,Alentejo,,,Portuguese White,Cartuxa
101769,US,"A lush Cabernet that feels soft and delicious right now, but has layers of complexity that make it a cellar candidate. Dry and oaky, the wine is enormously rich in blackberry, cassis, cocoa and cedar flavors, with considerable tannins. The wine is wonderfully balanced. Drink now through 2010, at least.",,93,90.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Etude
101770,US,"This is one of the most successful Pinots the winery has produced, and I have no doubt it's because the vintage was so cool. The wine is absolutely dry and has bracing acidity, with extraordinarily long, deep flavors of grapes that achieved maximum ripeness but remain balanced. Cherries, raspberries and blackberries flood the palate, enriched with earthier notes of balsam, cola, soy, licorice and spice. Drink now through 2011.",Chenoweth Ranch,93,55.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
101771,Germany,"For a beerenauslese, usually dominated by honeyed fruit, this shows a surprising degree of stony minerality, which helps to balance the rich, sweet flavors of orange marmalade, dried apricots and honey. Viscous in texture, yet the citrus and mineral notes keep it from becoming cloying. Drink now–2035.",Abtsberg Beerenauslese,93,204.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Maximin Grünhäuser
101772,US,"At its best Rubicon stuns with power and richness. In lesser vintages (which are usually hotter ones) the wine, which is largely Cabernet Sauvignon, can be raisiny. While 2004 was a warm year, diligent viticulture paid off, resulting in an opulent wine with the purest expression of crushed cherries and blackberries, and oak-inspired hints of nougat and caramel. Fairly aggressive in tannins now, it should begin to open by 2008 and drink well for a decade.",Rubicon,93,125.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Rubicon Estate
101773,US,"This is certainly dramatic in structure, akin to a young Pauillac from Bordeaux, with concentrated currant, cherry, pencil lead and cedar flavors wrapped into youthfully hard tannins. It needs time, and should soften with increased complexity by 2009. Could reward with even longer cellaring, but '04 was not a great vintage.",Pickett Road,93,150.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vine Cliff
101774,US,"Raspberries, cherries, cola, tea, rhubarb pie, licorice, vanilla and sweet leather flavors flood the mouth, wrapped in a delicately silky, complex texture, and the finish goes on and on in oak-inspired fruit and Asian spices. Compellingly delicious; drinks now and through 2009.",Marimar Estate Vineyard,93,48.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,W.H. Smith
101775,US,"Shows the precision and control of Smith's previous Maritime Pinot, marked by a tense, exciting structure. Crisp acids and fine, dusty tannins dance with earthy cherry and cola fruit, herbs and oak to create a complex, tremendously rewarding palate experience. Best now through 2010.",Maritime,93,54.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,W.H. Smith
101776,Germany,"With scents of dried apricots and superconcentrated pear nectar, one sniff suggests this is going to be a sumptuously sweet treat. And it is. Pear, melon and spice flavors linger elegantly on the finish, ending long and sweet.",Rosa-Goldlack Beerenauslese,93,395.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Schloss Johannisberger
101777,US,"I love this Pinot for its tense balance of acidity and fruit, which make for great complexity. The vineyard is south-facing, 1,000 feet above Boonville, and the sunshine helped enormously in this cool vintage, ripening the grapes just enough to give an edge of bitter cherry and red raspberry to the earthy cola, leather and spice flavors. Utterly dry, this is a real connoisseur's wine, one that takes some understanding to appreciate.",Abbey-Harris Vineyard,93,46.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Anthill
101778,Germany,"Made from an early picking of botrytized grapes from the Bernkasteler Lay vineyard, this is a sweet, plump wine, filled to the brim with lush tropical fruit flavors. The aromas show remarkably pure pear and pineapple scents, with just a touch of dried apricots but also a sense of slate-driven minerality. With 300 cases imported, it should prove relatively easy to find.",Beerenauslese,93,55.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Dr. Loosen
101779,US,"The vineyard is source of high-quality fruit, but also intense mountain tannins that require time to melt. Under those tannins is dramatically rich black currant and carob fruit flavor, easily big enough to sustain 100% new French oak. By 2009 this 100% Cab should begin to soften and sweeten, and it will drink beautifully for at least six more years.",Hillside Reserve,93,108.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Flora Springs
101780,Australia,"Befitting its age, this wine is dark coffee in color, changing to greenish at the rim. Flavors are malty and molasses-like, accented by scents of burnt coffee and sugar. This is broad, mouthcoating and sweet—an authoritative expression of Rutherglen Rare Tokay.",Rare Muscadelle,93,300.0,Victoria,Rutherglen,,Tokay,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards
101781,Germany,"Rich and thickly textured, this wine features intense botrytis aromas of dried apricots, backing them up with flavors of honey and orange marmalade.

Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Erdener Treppchen Trockenbeerenauslese,93,144.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Stephan Ehlen
101782,Germany,"Sweet and slightly viscous in texture, this wine lacks some aromatic flourishes, sacrificing complexity for purity of its pineapple, apple and citrus flavors. Yet because of its balanced, crisp acidity, the wine still sings, finishing long and mouthwatering. Drink now–2030.",Niersteiner Oelberg Beerenauslese,93,48.0,Rheinhessen,,,Riesling,Seebrich
101783,US,"Bill Smith is better known for his Pinot Noirs, but he founded La Jota and knows a thing or two about Howell Mountain Cabs. This is a big, dry, tannic mountain wine, virtually undrinkable now for its hard astringency. However, it's a fine cellar candidate. Brims with ripe blackberries and cherries that just need time. Should begin to open in 2008, and develop for another 8 years or so.",Purple Label,93,54.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,W.H. Smith
101784,France,"Just a touch less lively than the 2002 and 2005 versions, Hugel's 2001 Gewürztraminer SGN is still excellent, boasting plenty of weight and richness allied to distinctive varietal aromas of rose petals and cracked white pepper alongside the dried apricot notes of botrytis.",Sélection de Grains Nobles,92,197.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Hugel
101785,US,"With small amounts of Carignane and Petite Sirah, this hails from the winery's estate vineyard in Dry Creek Valley, one of the great sources of Zinfandel in California. It is a very fine Zin, showing near perfect balance. Tannic and dry, the blackberry, blueberry, cherry, chocolate, sweet leather and spice flavors are enriched with the vanilla and smoky char of oak.",,92,30.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ferrari-Carano
101786,Spain,"Molasses, spice, chocolate and pure raisins define this as classic P.X. It's syrupy but not too much so, with maple, cinnamon and brown sugar flavors. For a sweet and candied dessert wine, it has excellent balance and persistence. A star among many in this category; these wines are hard not to like.",Añada,92,18.0,Andalucia,Montilla-Moriles,,Pedro Ximénez,Alvear
101787,US,"The Audrey Cuvée brings extra richness to the regular Diamond T Estate Chard. It's an enormous wine that has honeyed sweetness. The flavors are of apricot jam, pineapple tart and lemon meringue, and new, smoky oak plays a prominant part. This Chard calls for careful pairing with food, since it's so rich, almost a dessert wine.",Diamond T Estate Cuvée Audrey,92,75.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Talbott
101788,Portugal,"The top-of-the-line red from Esporão, this partners the white Private Selection. The comparative restraint of this wine is admirable, with ripe, bright fruits, smoothed by wood. The dark, dry tannins and the dense, almost impenetrable texture hint at the power; finishing with wood spice and acidity.",Reserva Private Selection,92,39.0,Alentejo,,,Portuguese Red,Herdade do Esporão
101789,Italy,"This sophisticated metodo classico sparkler has deep complexity thanks to well-rendered notes of yeast and toast that recall apple pie crust or fresh baking bread.

101790,France,"Big fruited wine, its wood element just a support for the ripe black berry and cranberry flavors.

101792,Australia,"Expressive yet balanced, with pronounced cedar and cigar box scents that fold into a tight palate of toffee, raspberry and blueberry pie.

Drinking well now but will keep several years.",Mulberry Tree,87,18.0,South Australia,Langhorne Creek,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bleasdale
101793,US,"Good, deep flavors in this dry Cabernet. They include well-developed blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and tobacco, with savory hints of licorice, black pepper and cinnamon toast, smeared with plum jam.

101805,US,Pushes Zinfandel to the limit of balance. The alcohol is nearly 16%. The tannins are hard. The blackberry and currant flavors wander into raisins.

101849,Chile,"Rich, candied, nutty and moderately sweet, with a bit of popcorn, baked apple and banana on the nose. In the mouth, it's more citrusy and forward, with juicy, acid-based flavors of apple and a full allotment of spice to add complexity. This vintage finds the right blend of ripeness and oak. Drink now.",Amelia Limited Release,89,37.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Concha y Toro
101850,Australia,"Dry, lean and tight, this is a crisply mineral Sauvignon Blanc that manges to avoid any sense of grassiness or overly herbal notes, instead focusing on a narrow range of fruit flavors: green apple, lime and grapefruit. Fine as an apéritif or with light seafood dishes. Drink now.",The Y Series,86,12.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Sauvignon Blanc,Yalumba
101851,Italy,"This brilliant Vernaccia (with 10% Viognier) has a sweet, candy-like nose that recalls caramel and butterscotch but that also has fresh aromas of stone fruit and pear to give it dimension.

101853,South Africa,"Robertson has managed to create a solid, appealing Chardonnay at an excellent price. This one has a big nose of fresh fruit and orange citrus, and on the palate, assertive fruit and toast. Not terribly complex but definitely robust and flavorful, this is an ideal everyday white.",,86,9.0,Robertson,,,Chardonnay,Robertson Winery
101854,US,"Comprised of traditional Port varieties, this is a very dry, high-acid wine of a certain charm. With its silky texture and cherry and rose petal flavors, you might mistake it for a countrified Grenache. It finishes in a swirl of cloves, cinnamon and other dusty spices.",Vino Tinto,86,22.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Red Blend,Bray
101855,Chile,"The majority of Calina's wines are solid and worth their price, as is this lively Cab. It gets going with forward aromas of leather, cassis and earth.

101858,Chile,"Welcome to the movies, and enjoy your buttered popcorn! Or in this case, enjoy your Aconcagua Chardonnay, which has been doused in a ton of buttery oak but still manages to retain kick courtesy of solid core acidity.

101859,Chile,"Oaky and a little spotty, with aromas of cheese, cinnamon and wood resin sitting heavily on herbal, traditional fruit. The acidity is bracing, so there's a lemony bite to the palate along with flavors of raisin, raspberry and cherry. A fairly good blend of Merlot, Carmenère and Cabernet, but one that's missing a few parts.",Reserva Merlot-Carmenère-Cabernet Sauvignon,86,15.0,Maule Valley,,,Red Blend,Valle Frio
101860,Chile,"A little soft, with inconsistent early aromas giving way to roasted plum and black-fruit flavors. The more time you give it the better it gets, but at $55 this Syrah falls squarely into the category of underwhelming. It's rich and has satisfying sweet-fruit flavors, but it doesn't have much structure nor does it register as the top-shelf red that it's price tag suggests.",Pangea Apalta Vineyards,86,55.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Syrah,Ventisquero

101862,Australia,"This Pinot Grigio from a new producer in the cool Adelaide Hills starts off a little herbal—almost minty—then delivers a full-bodied, weighty palate experience.

101866,Italy,"This youthful wine is heavy on oak with aromas of toast, vanilla and coffee bean backed by black cherry, leather and tobacco.

101870,US,"This '06 is the winery's regular bottling, not the reserve, and Chard lovers will find it a little lacking in richness. Still, it's a dry, crisp, elegantly structured wine, with mineral-infused pear and pineapple flavors.",,86,24.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Clos du Val

101874,Italy,"This darkly saturated Riserva has an inky, ripe quality that recalls blueberry preserves, marmalade and smoked bacon.

101875,US,"Shows those classic, old-fashioned Howell Mountain tannins that lock the wine down and make it more or less undrinkable in youth. There are some good black currant flavors, but they're not really powerful, and have herbal notes alongside. That makes the future of this wine a question.",Ink Grade Vineyard,86,60.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Serdonis
101876,South Africa,"This overall good, refreshing Chard is a go-to white for everyday sipping.

Drink now.,Serraboella,88,30.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Cigliuti
101882,Spain,"Bold and chunky Ribera wine with black fruit aromas that don't tread lightly.

101885,US,"Strong in flavor, showing the ripeness and crispness of all Bjornstad's Chardonnays, with lemondrop, lime tart, vanilla and buttered toast flavors.

101894,Spain,"Peachy, mildly sweet, smooth and inviting. Godeval always makes a true and easy wine that showcases the essence of Godello but doesn't go off the blueprint.

101944,US,"There's quite a volatile kick to the nose, and this dry, astringent wine seems as if it has been worked over a bit too much.

102034,Argentina,"This is oakier and more expensive than prior Trapiche Chardonnays, but it's not necessarily better.

102063,Spain,"Smooth and nutty, with deep secondary aromatics of apricot and orange peel.

102070,US,"The vineyard, in interior Mendocino, has produced a lush, compelling Syrah in this warm vintage.

102071,US,"The block is the oldest on the estate, with extremely low-yielding vines, and the wine is not produced every year. The resulting Chard is very concentrated and dense. Everything about it is big: the apricot and peach fruit, the smoky oak, the yeasty lees. Tasted in August 2007, the wine was a little disconnected, like the parts of an enormous machine that has not yet been put together. Give this ambitious young wine a year or so to come together.",Unfined & Unfiltered Founder's Block,92,85.0,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Chalk Hill
102072,US,"Here's one for the cellar, not just because the tannins are so aggressive, but because the wine is so balanced. With alcohol only 13.8%, it's dry and rich in black currant fruit, almost a throwback to the Napa Cabernets of old that aged so well. It possesses a dry, elegant sophistication that stands in deliberate contrast to today's gooey, sweet style.

102073,US,"The Rutherford vineyard has been the source of well-regarded Cabs for Monticello and the '04 is the latest.

102074,France,"Fitou, a small region entirely surrounded by Corbières, is very dry in the summer. In 2004, when little rain fell, the grapes became extra concentrated, as shown here.

The black fruits, powered and concentrated, also have acidity and great perfumes from the Touriga Nacional.",Quinta da Viçosa,91,,Alentejano,,,Touriga Nacional Blend,J. Portugal Ramos
102076,US,"This is a Merlot-Cabernet blend from St. Helena and Oakville. It's pretty good, dry and rich in black currants, cherries and oak.

Age for five years.",Chocopalha Reserva,91,38.0,Estremadura,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta de Chocapalha

102079,Australia,"Dark amber in color, with some greening evident at the rim, this Tokay features aromas of scorched coffee and Guinness stout-like flavors, but is also sweet, with hints of molasses and raisins.

102080,US,"You can taste in the very high acidity, and the way the grapes just barely ripened. There's a rhubarb-heirloom tomato edge, but the cherries, raspberries and spicy cola win out, lending rich complexity to this totally dry, interesting young Pinot.

102082,US,"There aren't many Merlots coming off Atlas Peak, but there should be, to judge by this rich, dense, complex wine. It's enormously packed in black cherry, red currant, blueberry, milk chocolate and spicy licorice flavors that go on and on into the finish.

102083,South Africa,"A serious wine with real aging potential, this Bordeaux blend from on-the-radar vintner Adi Badenhorst marries muscular strength with a softer, savvy style.

Buller & Son
102085,Spain,"Big, brawny and not entirely welcoming: this Priorat heavyweight is full of licorice and cool black-fruit and cola aromas. The palate is hard as nails, and only time will tell if it softens and finds a sweeter spot. We think it will; in five years it should trade in the current burnt steak notes and fierce tannins for softer touches and more complex flavors.",Mas de Masos,91,70.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Capafons-Ossó
102086,Spain,"Serious wines from a tiny inland appellation in Catalonia—that's Abadal, a maker of true terroir wines that succeed way more often than they disappoint. This blend of Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Syrah is minerally and full of red fruit and vanilla aromas.

Even from a tough vintage it justifies its selected status.",Abadal Selecció,91,49.0,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,,Red Blend,Masies d'Avinyo
102087,South Africa,"Glen Carlou's wines are far from shy and this delicious Meritage from Paarl has all of the bold notes you'd expect from this producer.

This is a wine that will continue to unfold as it ages.",Grand Classique,91,20.0,Paarl,,,Meritage,Glen Carlou
102088,France,"An intense wine, superconcentrated, with very rich fruit, layers of dark tannins and wood, and fruit flavors that concentrate on dark plums, black figs and ripe blackberries.

102089,US,"A delicious Cabernet that managed to finesse the heat of the vintage better than many other wineries. It's much riper than past bottlings, with blackberry, cassis, cherry and chocolate fudge flavors accented by rich, smoky oak. But it's to soft to cellar. Too soft.

102097,France,"Perfumy and light-bodied, with plenty of white flowers, honey and beeswax. The dry palate turns almost sharp at the end, pointing to an affinity with oysters. This wine has neither the charm of youthful fruit nor the complexity of maturity; better to give it a few years age.",Réserve,86,20.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Lucien Albrecht
102098,Spain,"Dark as night, with prune and rubber on the nose along with murk and compost. It's extracted to the max, leaving a rubbery feel to go with supercharged boysenberry flavors.

102099,US,"Although the vineyard is source to some very great bottlings by others, this one has a sharpness throughout that detracts.

102103,US,"A good wine, but incomplete, and shows why Cabernet Franc is a tough variety to bottle on its own. You get a blast of cherries and oak, with sturdy tannins, but the wine lacks depth and complexity.",Robert's Blend,86,90.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Franc,Oakville Ranch
102104,Australia,"Bright and aromatic, with intense tropical fruit and a markedly full body.

102106,Germany,"Opens in an offbeat (in a good way) style, with cantaloupe, orange, chamomile and newly mown hay scents that give way to more classic flavors of wet stones and apricot in the mouth.

102108,US,"The aroma is all caramelized wood and the dominant flavor is buttered toast and caramel. Wood tannins also come into play, adding to the grape tannins to make for a tough mouthfeel. Somewhere in there is a pretty good Syrah with blackberry flavors. Decanting helps a little, but the oak may never integrate.",Block 9,86,50.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Terlato
102109,New Zealand,"This wine starts off with bold fruit-driven aromas of plums and black cherries, but there's just the merest hint of dried fruit as well, and that continues on the palate. It's ripe and round, but ultimately a bit bulky, ending with a touch of espresso.",Map Maker,86,30.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Staete Landt
102110,Germany,"An austere, spicy wine and a successful effort in the trocken category, with Christmas spices and orange peel scents and a light but balanced palate.

102112,Spain,"An assault of oak, vanilla and cigar box is the opening salvo, while wave two and three bring raisiny aromas and finally lemon peel.

102118,US,"Pinots at this price are usually pretty awful, but this bucks the trend and offers real value. It shows the silky texture, dryness and rich cherry-cola flavors you want in the variety, with an added touch of barrel age. The result is welcome. Production was 4,000 cases.",,86,16.0,California,California,California Other,Pinot Noir,Esser
102119,Hungary,"A good introduction to the better reds of Hungary, this Cabernet Sauvignon shows ripe berry character on the nose and notes of plums and stewed fruit in the mouth. What it lacks in freshness, it makes up for in concentration and ambition. Try with beef stew. Best now but will last a few years.",,86,25.0,Villány,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gere Attila
102120,US,"Clean and varietal, with pretty blackberry and cherry fruit, and a sweet plum note that comes in behind. It's resonant and fruity, with spice and a firm, tensile structure that gives it definition—all in all, a lovely bottle.",,89,36.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Malbec,Otis Kenyon
102121,Italy,"Here's an attractively vibrant and lively red wine from the Adriatic side of Italy with ripe berry notes of blueberry, raspberry and wild forest flowers. Spice, tobacco and leather fill in the background and the wine tastes velvety and smooth in the mouth.",Scabi,89,,Central Italy,Sangiovese di Romagna,,Sangiovese,San Valentino
102122,Italy,"There's a bright and zesty aroma here that recalls tangerine skin or lemon zest, acting as a delicate accent over blackberry and mature cherry. This is dark, inky red wine from Central Italy with a lively but masculine personality.",Marina Cvetic Iskra,89,40.0,Central Italy,Colli Aprutini,,Red Blend,Masciarelli
102123,US,"A pretty, polished and elegant Pinot Noir, impeccably made and finely balanced. May lack some of the depth of Williams Selyem's other '07s, but it shows a complex array of cherries, cola, mocha, sandalwood and smoke. Drink now.",,89,34.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem

102125,US,"As always, the Otis vineyard carries defining scents of pepper, sage, earth and stem; the fruit is restrained and also quite herbal. And yet the wine has old vine character, and ages beautifully, more like a Bordeaux than anything from this country. It's a fine bottle to tuck away into the cellar. Right now, the grapey, slightly plummy fruit and dried herbs are not entirely integrated.",Otis Vineyard Old Vines,88,25.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Columbia Winery
102126,Italy,"This Riserva from Montefalco, Umbria is made with 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon.

The wine is firm and structured, but the tannins are not aggressive.",Riserva,88,40.0,Central Italy,Montefalco Rosso,,Red Blend,Antonelli
102127,Chile,"Lots of color and dark fruit, but a little too generic to score higher. This is a smooth, polished wine with blackberry, cassis and licorice aromas and flavors. It doesn't vary much from its core identity but it's healthy, structured and not short on tannins and acidity. Expect more from the 2006 vintage.",Hacedor de Mundos Reserva,88,25.0,Loncomilla Valley,,,Merlot,Gillmore
102128,Italy,Alba Nora is a creamy Chardonnay (aged in oak for nine months) with buttery notes of almond and peach. There's zesty acidity that caps an impression of richness and density. Pair this opulent wine with seafood jambalaya.,Alba Nora,88,,Sicily & Sardinia,Isola dei Nuraghi,,Chardonnay,Feudi della Medusa
102129,Australia,"This is pretty oaky stuff, loaded with toast and cedar aromas, but still showing some lush blueberry fruit underneath. It's a wine that's fleshed out by supple tannins, moderately high alcohol and drenched in eau de fût neuf, yet finds a precarious balance among those items. Probably best to drink now.",,88,30.0,South Australia,Southern Flinders Ranges,,Shiraz,Flinders Run
102130,New Zealand,"At only 8.5% alcohol, this is on the racy, lean side, although there's sufficient residual sigar to balance the crisp acids.

102140,US,"Planted in 1972, these old vines produce a delicate Pinot Noir, high in acid, pretty and relatively pale in the glass, with scents of tart cranberry, mineral and pomegranate.

102142,US,"Despite reductive scents of rubber tire at first sniff, the aromas quickly open up and the wine shows round, raspberry and cherry fruit, ripe and clean.

102143,South Africa,"This white Swartland blend of Grenache Blanc, Viognier, Rousanne and Chenin Blanc offers a rich combination of pear and flowers with a nutty spin. Lush but clean, it's a sophisticated food pairing wine or an indulgent sip on its own.",7,88,34.0,Swartland,,,White Blend,Sequillo
102144,US,"A step up from the Vin du Lac Merlot, this includes 16% Merlot and 8% Malbec in the blend, and profits from it, with dusty, sweet fruit that is not overwhelmed by the new oak. In the mouth, details from the 22 months it was aged in barrel begin to emerge, it's not just a wash of vanilla and chocolate, but shows added complexity and texture.",Barrel Select,88,31.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vin du Lac

102149,US,"This 80% Cabernet/20% Merlot is sleek and polished, with moderate levels of alcohol, pretty floral aromas, and a pleasing sense of winemaker restraint across the board.

The tannins are just right also; this is a wine that could surprise with more time in the cellar.",,88,36.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trust
102150,France,"Made in an off-dry style with fresh almond and grapefruit flavors and some good intensity. From biologically grown fruit, this shows crispness and a light edge of tannin. Give it a couple of years.",Le Noyer,85,18.0,Loire Valley,Vouvray,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine du Petit Coteau

102152,Australia,"A surprisingly lackluster performance for this well-known Western Australia brand.

Imported by Howard Park Wines.",,85,20.0,Western Australia,Western Australia,,Riesling,Howard Park
102153,US,"This wine may age to interesting things, but currently it's hard in tannins and acidity, and so dry it makes you long for some sugar.

Should pair well with rustic grilled meats.",,85,15.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Petite Sirah,Greg Norman California Estates

102155,US,"With citrus and floral flavors in addition to Chard's usual pears and apples, this wine might be confused for a Pinot Grigio or even a leaner style of Viognier.

102158,Italy,"There's a smoky-toasty quality to this Vernaccia that masks the wine's natural fruit and emerges as its most immediately recognized aroma. It has a tart, spicy feel in the mouth thanks to oak aging, and enough acidity to keep it clean.",I Mocali Riserva,85,33.0,Tuscany,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,,Vernaccia,Vagnoni
102159,Chile,"Given the price this is pretty good stuff. It's plush and offers enough body and ripe fruit to offset the fact that there isn't a whole lot of structure or backbone. For a soft, tasty plum-and-herb style of Carmenère, however, it gets the job done.",,85,7.0,Maule Valley,,,Carmenère,Simone
102160,Chile,"Buttercup aromas give a sense that this wine is right on the edge. And it probably is; it's an '06 with ripe, soft, melony flavors and lots of pineapple and mango on the finish. Big and fruity now, but it's not going to last much longer.",Special Reserve,85,10.0,Maule Valley,,,Chardonnay,Simone
102161,Italy,"Noticeable oak-driven notes of toasted nuts take center stage and are embellished by delicate tones of stone fruit, chestnut honey and yellow flower. The oak notes are strong, though, and take away from the natural fruit.

102162,New Zealand,"Perplexing, given the superb performance of the 2005, but this wine is not on that level. There's a smoky note to this edition that brings hints of cured meat or beef bouillon to mind, adding a strange note to the herbal, citrusy flavors.",,85,23.0,Waipara Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,Pegasus Bay
102163,US,"This is a high-acid, young Pinot. Bone dry and tart, it has green mint-infused, bitter cherry flavors, and the texture is nice and silky, even elegant. Yet it lacks the sensual opulence you want in a fine Pinot, and doesn't seem likely to age.",Spring Grove Vineyard,85,27.0,California,San Benito County,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Pessagno

102173,US,"Give this puppy a good decanting if you open it anytime soon. It's young and tight as nails. The wine is dark and closed and tannic and acidic, but clean and interesting. Somewhere down deep is a core of spicy black currant, but it's locked down.",Estate Vineyard,85,40.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Baker Lane
102174,US,"This is a powerful Chardonnay. It's explosive in tropical fruit, in malic acids and in new charred oak. All the parts kind of stick out on their own, going in different directions. It's a good New World style, but it should have more synergy.",Oro de Plata,85,26.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller Estate

102178,Chile,"A bit of brambly sharpness guards the bouquet, but digging will get you to raspberry and plum aromas.

102181,Italy,"Dense and gripping, this Nebbiolo d'Alba outdoes many Barolos. The complex nose shows blueberry notes and lifted aromas of perfumed soap. The palate is concentrated but in a closed state; leather and tar notes dominate but yield to refreshing blackberry flavors on the finish. Can be drunk now but several years aging will give the tannins a chance to soften and allow the palate to open up.",Valmaggiore,88,55.0,Piedmont,Nebbiolo d'Alba,,Nebbiolo,Sandrone

102183,Italy,"A little earthy, but some charming aromas of licorice and tar show through on the slightly diffuse nose. Nebbiolo's normally grippy tannins have been beaten into submission here, providing a soft frame for leather and strawberry flavors which follow through to the moderate finish. Should gain complexity from a year or two in the cellar.",,88,44.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Beni di Batasiolo

102187,France,"Somebody was carried away with wood here. The wine is totally dominated by flavors of burnt wood— even the 50% new wood was too much in 2007.

102188,Spain,"A blend of Tempranillo with Cab Sauvignon and Merlot. Aromas of black cherry, spice, aged cheese and earth are solid, while the palate features good fruit but some weakness in structure.

102191,Italy,"There's a lot going on here, with a profusion of black fruit flavors underscored by an edgy ash note.

102193,US,"Despite the “valley” appellation, this is one of the highest elevation vineyards in Sonoma County. It's a dense, tannic, concentrated wine, with a deep core of black currants, black pepper and chocolate. Zinfanatics will absolutely love it, but it's very high in alcohol, almost Port-like, although the finish is absolutely dry.",Bismark Mountain Vineyard,88,65.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hanna

102196,Australia,"Starts off with some Rhône-like aromas of smoke, cracked pepper, blueberries and a touch of meatiness, then delivers vibrant fruit and spice on the palate.

102197,Spain,"A round, full specimen with mineral-laden raspberry aromas and a fresh but serious palate of berry, cherry cough drop and fine rubber.

102199,Argentina,"A nice Torrontés with good muscat-like aromas along with a blast or orange blossom. The palate has weight, roundness and good, true flavors of lemon, orange and melon. Long and rock-solid on the finish, with focus throughout. Drink soon.",Unoaked Reserva,88,17.0,Other,Salta,,Torrontés,Terrazas de Los Andes
102200,Italy,"This is a powerful bully of a wine but a good value in the pricey Barolo category.

Give it a few years to grow up.",,88,16.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Veglio

102202,Italy,"After initial notes of fresh paint blew off, deep berry fruit and woodsy aromas took over, making for a strong opening. Red plum and campfire flavors unfold in the mouth and show good depth. The lightly spiced finish winds up slightly hot. Will hold a year or two but unlikely to improve substantially.",Bionzo,88,50.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,,Barbera,La Spinetta
102203,US,"This is a 100% Cabernet, grown further north than the winery's amazing Rockaway bottling, which is to say in a hotter area. Comparisons are inevitable. Although it's rich and even dramatic, it's not as impressive a wine, showing a raisiny edge to the black currants and chocolate. Doesn't have the balance for aging, so drink now with upscale beef and lamb dishes.",Brothers Ridge Single Vineyard,88,75.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
102204,Italy,"Pio Cesare's Barbera is a modern interpretation of a traditional grape, and a well-done one at that.

102306,Australia,"Pinot Gris is trendy in Australia, which to date hasn't meant great things in terms of home-grown quality.

102307,US,"Could be drier and more minerally, because the lemongrass, gooseberry and wildflower flavors finish jammy-sweet. But ultracrisp acidity helps to balance, and the ultimate impact of this wine is mouth-cleansing and steely.",,87,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Twomey
102308,Italy,"Buoyant berry notes jump out of the glass in a very direct and vertical manner. You'll recognize aromas of black cherry, red apple and cassis berry.

102309,South Africa,"With a confectioned finish and sweet mocha notes on the nose, this might have seen a little too much wood in its 16 months in new French oak.

102310,US,"Eight vineyards and six grapes go into this table red; in some vintages this hits the mark, as it does here.

102312,US,"Made in a food-friendly fashion, this Chard is dry, acidic and minerally. It was obviously picked at lower ripeness, but still shows a warm core of pineapples and green apples.

The first sniff is of a burst of white pepper, while the first sip assaults the palate, in a good way, with ripe blackberry, plum, mulberry and roasted meat flavors, and a sprinkling of cloves and anise.

102365,Spain,"If at first the wine seems sweet and scattered, just give it time. Soon the nose will knit together to show mocha and that lightly oxidized elegance that is Oloroso.

102379,US,"Only 4% of this wine was barrel fermented in new oak. The majority was stainless-steel fermented.

102397,Italy,"There's the slightest hint of matchstick at the start that initially takes away from the integrity of the fruit.

102399,France,"Noticeably off-dry, this wine opens with spice and rose aromas shot through with mineral notes, followed by a faintly watery palate that nonetheless comes through with some lovely spiced pear flavor. Unctuous, medium finish. Serve as an apéritif.",Réserve,86,21.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Lucien Albrecht
102400,France,"Markedly complex aromas of bruised apple, pear, peach and carnation set up expectations that the mouth can't quite live up to; it's a bit thin though dry and nicely balanced with a finish of fall leaves and green plums. Try with cream pasta dishes. Drink now.",Le Fromenteau,86,35.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Josmeyer
102401,US,"Good and dry, with crisp acidity and a rich streak of citrus fruits suggesting pineapples and limes. Floral notes of honeysuckle add to the impression of richness. The wine also is fairly strong in gooseberries, with that tart, pungent, earthy taste.",Lillie Vineyard,86,20.0,California,Guenoc Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Sauvignon Blanc,Langtry
102402,Australia,"There's just a bit of Merlot mixed with the Cabernet Sauvignon here (18%) that likely contributes to the herbal, woodsy aspect of the nose.

102403,US,"Not as rich or satisfying as the  '06, probably a victim of the cool vintage. The wine makes an effort at lean elegance, and largely succeeds, except for a stubborn sharpness throughout.

102404,Australia,This unusual blend of Colombard and Sauvignon Blanc really works.

102405,US,"Feels heavy and inert, with strong tannins and a peculiar softness that limits liveliness. The berry-cherry flavors have a hint of currants.

102407,New Zealand,"This wine's muted aromatics and lack of texture vividly illustrate why the Spy Valley Gewürzes should be consumed in their first flush of youth.

102411,Australia,"Although the oak treatment here is heavy-handed, with a blanket of vanilla and coconut weighing down the fruit, there's enough fruit for some cherry and cassis notes to come through.

102416,US,"This area of central Rutherford is far better known for Cabernet. Sauvignon Blanc is rare. This is a pretty good one. Not great, because it's compromised by some unripe, green, stalky flavors.

102481,US,"Similar to past bottlings, Bourassa's 2005 Syrah is slightly rustic. It has a baked-fruit quality of blackberry and black cherry pie filling, and is very peppery.

102483,Italy,"The nose is a bit thorny and not particularly generous in fruit or other identifying characteristics.

102484,Chile,"There isn't enough fruit on this high flier to give it the unqualified seal of approval. In fact, for $50 it has its issues, namely a nose of boot polish and grainy oak.

Not a bad wine per se but not a big success either.",Cayao,85,50.0,Central Valley,,,Red Blend,Botalcura
102485,US,"There's nothing subtle about this blush wine made from Zinfandel. It was barrel fermented and barrel aged for 15 months, giving it a full-bodied mouthfeel and even some dusty tannins, and it has robust flavors of cherries, cola, beef jerky and licorice.

102496,US,"This high-acid Chardonnay has a prickly mouthfeel. It tastes considerably more tart than almost anything out there, which at least makes it different.

102510,US,"There's bracing heat in this Zin that's blended with 20% Petite Sirah. The heat comes partly from the high alcohol, partly from the notes of crushed white and black peppercorns, partly from the charred new oak and partly from the baked quality that marks the blackberry note.

102570,Chile,"Rubbery and hard on the nose, but with solid berry and cassis aromas lying in wait. The palate is solid, fresh and good, with raspberry, plum and herbal flavors. Finishes dry and herbal but there's enough fruit and clarity to push it up a notch or two.",Reserva,86,14.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Merlot,Caliterra
102571,Spain,"Colorful and pretty to look at, but a little sweet. The nose has a sweet, maple syrup element along with dry berry fruit aromas.

102572,US,"Tastes soft and a little tired at the age of six-plus years, with pie-filling raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. A certain dry complexity makes it interesting, but its lifespan is largely exhausted.",Hillside Estate,86,36.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Collier Falls
102573,US,"No it's not a mistake—this is Columbia Valley Washington Pinot Noir. A rare beast, but one that delivers an interesting bottle at this modest price point. Earthy, tannic, even a bit rough, but showing genuine varietal character and enough tart red fruit to provide a counterpoint.",,86,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Pinot Noir,Castle Rock
102574,Spain,"A warm, aggressive wine with baked berry aromas, kirsch, bacon and rubber. The palate has hard, astringent tannins but the flavors are good once they air out; there's blackberry, plum and brown sugar. Firms up on the finish as the tannins do their thing. Tasted twice with divergent findings; this note reflects the common traits from both wines.",Crianza,86,14.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Condado de Oriza
102575,Israel,"Black berry and plum aromas keep greener notes from dominating the bouquet, along with accents of stale burnt coffee that lingers in the back.

102580,Chile,"A bit rough at first, with aromas of burnt field, corn and haystack. It gets fruitier with time, and the palate is smooth despite offering a lot of citrus and pineapple flavors. Finishes both lively and a touch creamy, with tang and vitality.",Falaris Hill Vineyard,86,18.0,Leyda Valley,,,Chardonnay,Leyda
102581,Chile,"Floral smelling but also leafy and rubbery, with an overriding set of cheesy, leathery aromas. It's crisp, tart and acidic in the mouth, with lean, generic red plum, aged cheese and vanilla flavors. Medium in weight, with choppy crispness to finish.

102582,New Zealand,"Light in body and frankly a little skinny, this is nevertheless a pretty wine, its tannic structure of skillfully woven silk. Subtle cherry and sous bois notes aren't overly powerful, but persist nicely on the finish. Drink now.",Tom's Block,86,28.0,Nelson,,,Pinot Noir,Neudorf
102583,Spain,"This is the first Las Brisas rosado that's come to us, and it's good in a tangy, tropical sort of way. The nose delivers mango along with light citrus and berry, while the palate is tangy, jumpy, citric and tastes mostly of orange and tangerine. Good but fairly monotone in aromas and flavors; made from 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Las Brisas Rosado,86,12.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Rosé,Naia

102587,New Zealand,"A decent value in New Zealand Pinot Noir, the 2008 Wild Rock displays aromas of bright if somewhat simple cherry fruit.

102589,US,"Harmony is a good word to describe this spirited Bordeaux blend, with its perfumed black cherry nose accented with menthol and fresh-cut herbs.

102594,Chile,"Sweet oak and toast are the lead aromas; underneath you'll find regular cassis and berry notes. The palate is healthy but low in depth and complexity. Tastes woody, spicy and infused with vanilla, while the fruit character is average and the finish a bit resiny.",Classic Series,86,12.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Montes
102595,Italy,Cetamura is a consistently excellent value wine from Tuscany that shows bright berry and forest fruit nuances backed by a crisp but thin mouthfeel. Those qualities make it an ideal choice for cheesy pasta.,Cetamura,86,11.0,Tuscany,Chianti,,Sangiovese,Badia a Coltibuono
102596,US,"Arctos is more Cab-centric than its sibling Ursa, but in 2007 it must take second place. The blend is about two thirds Cab Sauvignon, with the other four Bordeaux grapes also represented. It has scents and flavors of fruit that seems just on the verge of spoilage—both leafy and fat, and there is a bitterness to the finish that overtakes the ripe, raisiny berry fruit.",Arctos,86,41.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Baer
102597,Italy,Avignonesi's Riserva Grandi Annate is designed as an icon wine from Tuscany but doesn't quite deliver the goods. The issue has to do with the aromas that recall sweet pumpkin contrasted against intense blue flower or violet.,Riserva Grandi Annate,86,85.0,Tuscany,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,,Prugnolo Gentile,Avignonesi

102601,Italy,"This is a milky, dark and deeply concentrated Barbera with soapy, floral notes and loads of blueberry and blackberry at the back. The quality of the fruit is sweet and chewy and although there is bright acidity here, the closing note delivers a blast of black cherry. A great value too.",Vobis Tua,87,11.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,,Barbera,Cantine Volpi
102602,Italy,"Here is a plush and elegant Barbera d'Alba with bright fruit tones followed by graphite, a dash of exotic spice and pretty earthy nuances.

102603,Italy,"This Barbera opens with meaty aromas that resemble smoked bacon or beef jerky but you'll also get whiffs of blackberry, prune and plum.

102604,Italy,"La Roera is a light and fresh expression of Barbera with bright fruit intensity and cooling crispness. The wine would work with wintery appetizers of cold cuts, salami, capers or olive paste on garlic toast.",La Roera,87,18.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,,Barbera,Cascina Roera
102605,Italy,"Masaréj is Castello del Poggio's top expression of Barbera d'Asti, but this vintage shows warm characteristics of earth, smoked bacon, bresaola, prunes and plums.

102607,US,"An interesting white wine, with crisp acidity and dry flavors of apricots, tangerines, peaches, lemons, limes and white flowers. If you can't tell what variety it is, that's because it's a blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Viognier.",Champ des Fleurs,87,26.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,White Blend,Venge
102608,US,"The aroma of charred oak dominates this Malbec, while oak tannins rule the palate. The underyling wine is soft and fruity and tannic in itself, with blackberry and currant flavors.

102609,Chile,"Floral, fresh and just big enough to make it worth a go. There's a bit of everything to this nice-priced Cab, including leafiness, red fruit, toast, chocolate and cassis.

102611,Chile,"This is yet another wine from the Santa Carolina portfolio that shows vast improvement over previous vintages. The nose offers perfectly nice and easy raspberry and cherry aromas, and there's nothing off about the palate, which gives warm black cherry, plum and buttery flavors that morph into cocoa on the finish.",Reserva,87,13.0,Maule Valley,,,Pinot Noir,Santa Carolina
102612,US,"Dry and very tart in the mouth, with a mouthfeel that remains acidically severe despite rich flavors of cherries, black raspberries and Dr. Pepper cola.

Now–2012.",Blue Jay,87,32.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Roessler
102613,US,"A very dry, acidic, rather severe Pinot Noir, made in a tighter, leaner style than most. If you find California Pinot too fruity, you'll like the streamlined raspberry, pepper and mineral flavors.",,87,30.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Paul Dolan

102618,US,"Tannins and acids make for a hard, resistant mouthfeel on this three-year-old Merlot.

102622,Australia,"With this wine's lifted aromas and candied fruit, it's frankly a bit confectionary.

102632,US,"There's a reason PG has become so popular in America, and this new one from Napa-based Benessere shows why.

102633,Spain,"The first whiff yields mostly raisins, but subsequent sniffs force up lush caramel and malt notes along with a blast of molasses.

102637,US,"This Sauvignon Blanc comes from two areas, the Arroyo Seco, which is such a great home to dry whites, and the warmer San Lucas appellation. Blended with small amounts of the Musqué clone and Semillon, the wine is bone dry, refreshingly crisp, and a close approximation of the famous wines of New Zealand's Marlborough.

102641,Spain,"Really good and interesting Syrah, with chocolate, campfire, menthol and prune on the nose. With airing the wine quickly settles into a deep, smooth berry and chocolate groove, while the finish deals pure tannins and comfort.

102644,US,"The Arroyo Seco is a rocky bench between the Salinas Valley and the Santa Lucia Highlands. It's really great terroir for white wines because the conditions allow for extraordinarily long hangtime, while cool, foggy nights preserve vital acidity.

102751,Argentina,"An opening of lightly baked black fruit aromas and graham cracker is pleasant and ready, while the palate has size, a cushioned feel and herbal, spicy berry flavors and a swatch of oak on the back end. With oak and toast on the finish, it comes to a nice conclusion. Good Malbec with some pedigree.",Felino,88,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Viña Cobos
102752,US,"Rather heavy and super-fruity now, with fruitstand flavors of blackberries, cherries and plums. It's a ripely delicious wine, but a bit one-dimensional, not showing much elegance or subtlety. Could develop bottle nuance over the next 4–6 years.",,87,32.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Syrah,Cuvaison
102753,Spain,"Maturing fairly well, with brown edges to the wine's earthy hue. The nose is rooty and deep, but there's a definite cheesy, mildly bretty accent to it.

102755,Argentina,"Different than most, with reduced, rubbery aromas that also bring graphite and olive into play. Very thick and syrupy in the mouth, with low acidity leading to chewy plum and blackberry flavors. Licorice and baked fruit notes control the finish, which is short and chunky. Ready to drink now.",Obra Prima Reserva,87,22.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Familia Cassone

102758,Spain,"Slightly prickly on the nose, but there's balancing melony sweetness to keep it on line. The palate is fresh and snappy, with citrus flavors, particularly grapefruit.

Drink now.",,87,25.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Sangiovese,Rivino
102768,US,"New oak dominates the aromas and flavors, with buttered toast, buttered popcorn and caramel overwhelming the underlying fruit, which suggests pineapples and green apples.

102769,Spain,"Firm, earthy and rubbery aromas lead to a tight, focused palate with robust black cherry in the lead and black tea and coffee notes along the side.

102771,Argentina,"A little heat early on, and also aromas of pepper, fresh fallen leaves and dry berry fruit. It's more traditional in style, meaning it isn't pitch black, sweet and thick.

102774,US,"Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with a drop of Cab Franc, this blend shows the type of tannins that Rutherfordians like to call dusty, and those tannins do have a finely ground latticework. But they're also astringently dry, and the underlying fruit flavors, of cherries and blackberries, don't seem rich enough to stand up to extended aging.",,87,75.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frog's Leap

102782,Chile,"Good if you like a big-boned red wine with plenty of extract, tannin and depth. The dark color gives this one away: it's chunky and grabby but also ripe, flush and receptive to airing. Hints of the herbals confirm that it's Carmenère.",,85,18.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Carmenère,Arboleda
102783,Chile,"You can literally smell the oak, right down to the wood's grain and resin. The palate is full and dense, with sweet, chewy berry fruit and lots of oak in support.

102804,New Zealand,"Hmmm. This has plenty of intensity, strident grapefruit flavors and crisp acids, but the aromas are marked by onion or garlic scents that make the wine perplexing to evaluate.

102926,US,"Dry, tough in tannins and acidic, this Merlot isn't offering much now. Despite a rich, concentrated vein of cherries, it's a hard, almost old-fashioned wine. Your best bet is to age it, but no guarantees. Try after 2012.",,86,35.0,California,Mount Veeder,Napa,Merlot,Mayacamas
102927,South Africa,"A solidly made Shiraz from power-producer Neil Ellis. Wild strawberries, white pepper and game notes appear on the nose, while red plum and sweet spice fill out the palate. Balanced acidity and dusty tannins with a satiny texture make this an easy-to-enjoy, ready-to-drink wine. Try pairing with loin lamb chops or wild boar stew.",Sincerely,86,14.0,Western Cape,,,Shiraz,Neil Ellis
102928,South Africa,"Medium-intense aromas of pear, red apple skin and delicate sweet spice appear on the nose, while accents of toast and limey citrus unfold in the mouth. Vibrant and easy to drink with a clean, softly wooded finish. Try with grilled steak fish like swordfish or mahi mahi.",Isabella,86,24.0,Stellenbosch,,,Chardonnay,Muratie
102929,Italy,"Beautifully aromatic Moscato grapes offer loads of honey, sweet peach and passionfruit on the nose. This is a delicate and feminine wine with soft, foamy bubbles capped by generous fruit flavors and natural sweetness.",,86,11.0,Piedmont,Moscato d'Asti,,Moscato,Gancia
102930,US,"The fragrances of lemon blossoms and honeysuckle hit your nose as soon as you pop the cork on this seductive white wine. It's so flavorful, so long in fruit and exotic in spices, and finishes mercifully dry. Twenty percent of barrel fermentation adds the perfect touch of creaminess.",,90,26.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Grigio,Terlato
102931,Portugal,"A rich, robust blend of Aragonês and Alicante Bouschet, this wine offers red fruits, spice and vanilla from wood aging. It is certainly rich, but there is elegance here as well; the exuberant fruit is tempered by acidity and some intensely firm tannins. Age for 4–5 years.",Callabriga,90,17.0,Alentejo,,,Portuguese Red,Sogrape
102932,US,"Far richer and more concentrated than the winery's regular '05 Pinot, this is a true reserve. It shows the same dryness and silky texture, but the spicy fruit is more intense in cherries and black raspberries, veering into cassis and anisette. Drink now for its extravagent flavors.",Dionysus,90,55.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Perbacco Cellars
102933,Australia,"The Pfeiffer style emphasizes freshness, and this wine reflects that in its floral and ripe berry aromas. Hints of raisin, honey and pineapple add richness and sweetness, balanced by peppery spice notes on the finish.",,90,18.0,Victoria,Rutherglen,,Muscat,Pfeiffer
102934,US,"Likeable for its balance and varietal richness, this 100% Cab is rich in blackberry and cherry fruit, while considerable oak adds a savory jacket of vanilla, toast and cedar-spice. Really defines the elegance and polish of its terroir, and should hold and improve for eight years.",,90,46.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sawyer
102935,US,"The lightest of Sea Smoke's trio of Pinots, the '05 Botella starts with ravishing aromas of red fruit confections like cherry pies and raspberry tarts, with notes of gingerbread and cinnamon sugar. Tastes as good as it smells, just a deliciously gentle, pure Pinot Noir. Good now, but the grippy tannins suggest midterm ageability.",Botella,90,40.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Sea Smoke
102936,US,"It's rare to get a white wine from Cabernet-centric Rutherford, but Voss does a good job with this dry, crisp, low-alcohol Sauvignon Blanc. You can taste the coolness of the vintage in the tangy acidity and the gooseberry-accented citrus, fig and white pepper flavors.",,90,20.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Voss
102937,Germany,"A soft, lush, sweet Riesling, but one that lacks the precision and cut of crisp acidity. The avalanche of honeyed fruit—nectarine, peach and pineapple—ends up being merely very enjoyable instead of transporting. Drink now–2015.",Bernkasteler Badstube Beerenauslese,89,44.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler
102938,US,"Ripe and expressive, with a gentle, velvety mouthfeel, this is marked by some firm, dry tannins that suggest moderate aging. There's some good spicy cherry and blackberry flavor, along with the sweet vanilla and cedar from considerable new oak.",Tietjen Vineyard,89,80.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Elyse
102939,US,"More tannic than in previous vintages, and not as immediately rich, this Cab-dominated Bordeaux blend will benefit from decanting. It needs some air to open up and reveal its heart of cassis. Will develop with six or so years of aging, but doesn't seem like a longterm cellar candidate.",,89,75.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,J. Davies
102940,Portugal,"From a winery that only started operations in 2001, one of the new wave in the Alentejo. This Reserva is in a modern, smooth style, big and powerful. But there's one welcome wrinkle in all this smooth fruit, and that is a dash of Cabernet Sauvignon which gives just the right amount of tannins and interestingly fresh acidity.",Reserva,89,,Alentejano,,,Portuguese Red,Herdade de São Miguel
102941,US,"Ripe and fleshy in young fruit, this Cab, with minor amounts of Cab Franc and Merlot, shows black currant, plum, cherry and cedar flavors, with a dry-sweet dusting of crushed brown herbs and spices. Fairly tannic and tight now, it's balanced enough for mid-term aging. Best 2008–2012.",Reserve,89,95.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frank Family
102942,US,"Not only extremely drinkable, but shows real varietal elegance and class.

Best now.",Reserve,89,24.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Frei Brothers
102943,Spain,"It's easy to throw high scores at almost any well-made P.X. because the wines are so viscous and overwhelmingly sweet. And while this one fits that bill, it has a couple of holes in it, namely a nose that stumbles out of the gate and a mouthfeel that's almost too thick and rich. Very nice but not at that ultrahigh level.",,89,15.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Pedro Ximénez,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
102944,South Africa,"Pinotage, with its often rustic, eccentric character, is typically a hard sell outside of South Africa. But producers like Lindhorst are proving that the variety can be just as appealing as any other red. This shows appetizing aromas of spiced meat and soft red berry, and on the palate, it has a round, velvety mouthfeel that is atypical of the sometimes prickly Pinotage. Pretty and full of dimension, the wine is a great introduction to the grape.",,89,29.0,Coastal Region,,,Pinotage,Lindhorst
102945,US,"Softer and gentler than a Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine, from one of the best but least known of Napa's mountain appellations, offers a wealth of oak-influenced cherry flavors. It finishes dry and spicy and complex.",Yates Family Vineyard,89,45.0,California,Mount Veeder,Napa,Cabernet Franc,Napa Redwoods Estate
102946,US,"Lots of richness in this smooth, complex Cab. It shows real quality in the depth of blackberry and spice fruit and the balance of ripe, sweet tannins and acidity.

102950,Portugal,"It's called Assemblage because the wine is a blend of Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon. This big wine, with its dense structure, texture and superripe fruit, is certainly rich. The tannins and the acidity do hold everything in check. But it's not a wine for aging.",Assemblage,89,12.0,Estremadura,,,Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon,Quinta de Pancas
102951,US,"Starting out as a very tannic, closed wine, this is one for the cellar. The question is how long. It's a big, dry, ripe Cab, with extracted blackberry, blueberry and cedar flavors, and while it should soften over the next five years, it doesn't have the stuffing for the long haul.",Bronze Label,89,42.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,W.H. Smith
102952,Portugal,"The local version of the Spanish Tempranillo, this is a firm, but wood- tinged wine, a core of acidity and black skin flavors giving a dense concentration to the wine, and contrasting with the great finishing acidity.",,89,18.0,Alentejano,,,Aragonês,Herdade do Esporão
102953,France,"Fresh and juicily fruity, even after its 4 years of aging, this wine has a good southern warmth and ripeness, full of blackberry flavors and a subtle touch of tannin and dryness under the sweet fruit.

102955,Portugal,"Freshly aromatic, this is a Portuguese equivalent of a Gewürztraminer. It has all the lychees and spice as well as a thick, almost viscous texture. Good acidity helps the balance.

102958,Spain,"Merlot, Cabernet and a splash of Syrah are brought together in solid, inspiring fashion by this Catalonian winery.

103021,US,"Soft and a bit hot in alcohol, this Cab has luscious flavors of blackberry jam, licorice and smoky oak. It's pretty tannic now, with a sandpapery mouthfeel. Doesn't seem like an ager, but nice now through 2011.",Estate,88,55.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frazier

103023,US,"Good for Hendry for going with this Spanish variety. It shows the new trend toward higher acid, drier white wines that appeal for their directness.

103024,Italy,"This fragrant Sagrantino di Montefalco offers slightly muddled aromas of spice, mature fruit, tobacco and tealeaf.

103025,US,"There's something old-fashioned but richly satisfying about this Pinot Noir. It's a bit heavy and quite ripe, with flavors of cherry preserves, black raspberry marmalade, cola, sweet heirloom tomatoes and new oak, wrapped into a sturdy mouthfeel. A bit soft, and ready now with a grilled steak.",Ferguson Block,88,45.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Robert Stemmler

103029,US,"Here is a good value effort, smoky, chewy and dense, with strong flavors but solid Merlot varietal character. There is unusual smokiness in the wine—presumably from barrel toast—but enough ripe fruit to offset that and the substantial tannins. The spicy finish suggests American oak barrels were used.",,88,15.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Merlot,Whidbey Island Winery
103030,New Zealand,"Shows some slightly flinty notes on the nose, while the bulk of the flavors run more toward citrus and nectarine.

103033,US,"The best of the 2006 McKinley Springs reds, this overcomes a fairly heavy dose of vanilla-flavored oak and moves into mixed cherry, plum, mocha, coffee and spice.

103037,Italy,You don't see many wines made from the Bovale grape;  it once faced extinction but is now being slowly replanted in Sardinia.

103039,France,"White, almost jammy fruits, mingle with acidity, minerality and tight tannins. This is a wine that offers spice, superrich fruit and intensity of flavor.

103040,France,"Very perfumed Pinot Noir aromas, a wine that offers more than usual weight for a red Sancerre, as well as ripe plums and some sweetness.

Very refreshing and clean.",,88,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Viognier,William Church
103050,Argentina,"Jammy strawberry aromas are alluring but light, which suggests more of an Old World style compared to most of the beefy, brawny Malbecs out there today.

103057,Spain,"Dark, roasted lead aromas frame secondary baked black fruit and leather scents, while the palate is oaky, stocky and tannic, with creamy, barrel-led berry flavors and more than adequate balance and freshness.

103064,Australia,"A solid effort, the 2007 Chockstone is a balanced, accessible red. There's ample cherry fruit, touches of cedar, vanilla and woodspice and modest tannins.

Pithy and biting late, with ample fruit throughout.",,87,15.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo-Viura,Esperanza
103070,US,"This is a dependably good, satisfyingly sweet wine from Eberle.

103071,US,"Very good, but could be firmer in tannic structure, with a soft, melted mouthfeel.

The softness seems to limit ageability.",Peters Vineyard,87,48.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kokomo
103072,US,"Arroyo Seco is an iffy place to grow Pinot or any red wine. Cool and windswept, it needs a warmer vintage, which 2007 wasn't. Rochelle's new bottling is very dry and acidic. It lacks a bit of generosity, in the green mint edge to the cherries. But it's very elegant, with an appealing minerality. Drink now.",Classic Clones,87,40.0,California,Arroyo Seco,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,La Rochelle

103077,Italy,"Here's a pretty Barbera d'Alba with cheerful aromas of blackberry, sweet spice and cinnamon. The wine is soft, round and smooth and that touch of sweetness on the close makes it a good candidate for roast tomatoes with chèvre chaud.",,87,14.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Pelassa
103078,US,"It was probably the vintage, which was less than spectacular, but this wine, while a good, elegantly structured Cabernet, doesn't justify its price. It's bone dry and tannic, with flavorful blackberries, black currants, minerals and oak. A fine wine to drink with upscale fare, but the sharp finish suggests against aging.",Home Ranch,87,75.0,California,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Steven Kent
103079,Italy,"Sleek and focused, with well-defined cherry fruit and red flower notes. The full-bodied palate is tightly wound with accents of orange peel and black cherry.

103081,Australia,"Pear and melon aromas are pleasant enough, followed by tart fruit and peppery spice on the palate.

103083,US,"Oak is the star of this Chard, to judge by the butterscotch and spicy caramel flavors that take center stage.

103088,US,"The grapes are from the Green Valley. The 2006 vintage was very cool, and this wine doesn't seem entirely ripe.

103094,Chile,"In some vintages Primus, a blend of Merlot, Cabernet and Carmenère from the cool Casablanca Valley, seems up there in ripeness.

103111,Spain,"A top-flight Toro that knows how to step on the gas but keep the car centered.

103112,US,"Imagine a Sauvignon Blanc with the weight of Chardonnay, and that's what you get with this single-vineyard wine. It's amazing, because the wine never saw oak. Still, it has a vanilla richness on top of pineapple, peach, anise and honeysuckle flavors. Maybe the correct comparison is of a white Cabernet Sauvignon, with the complexity that implies. What a great value.",Dutton Ranch Kylie's Cuvée,93,17.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dutton Estate
103113,US,"This is always a drily tannic wine in its youth, but it's also one of the most ambitious Cabs produced from Dry Creek Valley, and is worth attention. With a drop of Petit Verdot, it's young and jammy, explosive in black currant and chocolate flavors, with plenty of smoky oak. Although the tannins are big, they're completely ripe and sweet. Four-plus years of age have softened them. Drink this Cabernet Sauvignon now with very upscale foods, and it should hold and soften for a decade.",Endeavor,93,55.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dry Creek Vineyard
103114,Italy,"Cabreo is a bulldozer of a wine with brawny power, solid dimension and hearty aromas of smoked bacon, black ink, tar and chocolate fudge.

What we can tell at this early point of development is that it is saturated, healthy, balanced and clean. There's vibrancy and full tannins, with lip-smacking acidity.

It's a huge load at 15%, so be prepared.",Lui Selection,93,27.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Abelis Carthago
103119,US,"This 100% Cab will strike some cult Cabernet addicts as old-fashioned. It's  bone dry and firm in tannins, with an herb and olive tapenade taste to the riper currants and blackberries.

103128,US,"Give this dramatic young Pinot time to grow up. It's super-young in jammy cherry, raspberry, licorice, cola and smoky new oak flavors, and while the tannic-acid structure is first-rate, it's a little too unresolved for full enjoyment.

103132,US,"This is a gorgeous Cabernet, but it's pretty young, and while it's delicious now due to the ripe fruit, it really needs time. Wrapped in fresh, tight tannins, it displays powerful red and black currant, blackberry, cherry, chocolate and vanilla oak flavors, and shows the elegant, important mouthfeel of a top Napa Cab.

103204,US,"The Tempranillo has an agreeable entry, with pretty violet scents leading into tart raspberry and cherry fruit, amplified with a bit of barrel spice. It loses steam quickly, and the tannins turn chewy and a bit rough, but more bottle age may help smooth it out.",Les Collines Vineyard,86,35.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Tempranillo,Tertulia
103205,US,"Not the most successful Rosella's Pinot ever. The flavors are rich enough, suggesting raspberries, cherries and cola, and the wine is dry and silky.

103206,Chile,"Herbal and slightly volatile on the nose before it settles on meaty, herbal fruit aromas.

103207,Italy,"Here's an easy-going and traditional expression of Barbera that is not overstated or exaggerated in any way.

More pepper rides the finish along with mocha and coffee.",Reserva,86,13.0,Maipo Valley,,,Carmenère,Chono
103222,South Africa,"Cherry-centric throughout with supporting elements of wild forestry, fennel, sweet spice and blood orange.

103228,Australia,"Shows some rather riper-than-expected fruit flavors, hinting at peach or nectarine as well as the standard apple and lime. The result seems a touch off-dry, although the actual residual sugar is only 3.5 g/L. Despite being lightweight in the mouth, it turns a bit honeyed and weightier on the finish. Drink it over the next few years.",Hanlin Hill,86,20.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Riesling,Petaluma
103229,US,"Bone dry, with crisp, mouth-cleansing acidity and flavors of citrus fruits, minerals and vanilla. There's a touch of gooseberry and muscat. Turns almost sour toward the finish, but it's zesty and alive.",,86,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Picazo

103234,Spain,"It's not easy assessing this blend of Monastrell and Petit Verdot from a warm vintage. It's fiery and almost citric on the nose, while the palate is ripe as can be, with spicecake and blackberry syrup flavors. It's not missing any potency or ripeness, but the longer you work with it the larger and more medicinal it gets.

103235,South Africa,"From small-batch, handcraft producer Stark-Condé, this unfiltered Cab offers personality and elegance. Berry, herbs, fennel and spice on the nose lead into a red that's extremely pretty in the mouth.

103238,Italy,"Thanks to its vertical aromatic delivery, you can enjoy this sparkler's upfront fresh notes of green apple, peach, crushed white pepper and mineral.

103244,Portugal,"A soft, but spicy wine made from the Portuguese version of Tempranillo, giving rounded, silky tannins, balanced with fresh red berry fruits.

103252,US,"Bonterra's wines are always so crisp in acidity and so clean. Maybe that's because of their intense organic and biodynamic practices.

103256,US,"This is very good wine, showing total dryness, richness of tannins and herb-laden blackberry fruit.

103285,Argentina,"Spearmint and soft berry aromas turn toward raisin. This feels wide and flabby, with a lot of oak and resin notes in its frame. This is quite oaky, spicy and minty for Pinot Noir.",,82,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Noir,Alfredo Roca
103286,Mexico,"Waxy smelling and gritty, with an oily overtone, this feels O.K. but sort of wayward, with flavors of bitter grapefruit and matchstick. Simple and somewhat sour on the finish.",Equinoccio,82,21.0,Valle de Guadalupe,,,Chardonnay,Lafarga
103287,US,"A hard Cabernet to like, with a rough texture and sweet-and-sour cherry flavors.",Pedregal Vineyard,82,20.0,California,Paicines,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Shale Canyon
103288,Argentina,"A green and herbal style of northern Argentine Cabernet Sauvignon, this smells like tobacco, green bean, bell pepper and oregano. Quite tannic in feel, it bears a roasted herb flavor, finishing savory but green.",Don David Finca La Urquiza #8,82,20.0,Other,Cafayate,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Michel Torino
103289,US,"A simple, rustic wine, this is fairly sweet and tannic, with blackberry and raisin flavors. A burger or sloppy Joe on a bun will be just fine as a pairing.",,82,12.0,California,California,California Other,Petite Sirah,Pennywise
103290,US,"A decent wine, but pretty linear and with lots of divots. More proof that Cab Franc on its own is very difficult to make whole and complex. The wine is drily tannic, with cherry and oak flavors and cherryskin tannins. Drink now.",,86,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Franc,Coniglio
103291,Spain,"Some Barbier wines, depending on when you catch them, are fresh, pleasant and overdeliver. Others are dull and dead. This one falls into the first category with its melon, apple and Asian pear aromas and flavors. It's lithe, light in body and clean. Good as it gets for $6.",Mediterranean White,86,6.0,Catalonia,Catalunya,,White Blend,René Barbier
103292,Italy,"Try this refreshing Prosecco with crackers and cheese; the crisp acidity and floral freshness will keep your palate clean, bite after bite. Aromas here include acacia, honeysuckle and peach blossom.",Brut,86,19.0,Veneto,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,,Glera,Toffoli
103293,US,"Brawny just begins to describe this Zin. It's dry, tannic and full bodied, with powerful wild berry, currant, tobacco and spice flavors that finish in a reprise of tannic bitterness. Nothing shy about this born companion to barbecued ribs.",Old Vine,86,13.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Zinfandel,Truscott
103294,Germany,"This wine starts out with a serious ethyl acetate (nail polish remover) problem but cleans up with aeration. Aromas here are sweet and a bit candyish—sour apple, spiced pear and watermelon flavors that lead to a pleasant, flowery palate. Quite off-dry, with a shortish finish of orange blossom. Drink now.",Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Kabinett,86,26.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Vereinigte Hospitien

103296,Spain,"This seems like the best bet among the Tempra Tantrum lineup. The nose has vibrancy and good fruit content, while the palate is sizable and shows solid balance. Flavors of cherry and red plum are good, and the finish has some length.",,86,10.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Tempranillo-Shiraz,Tempra Tantrum
103297,US,"Spicy and exuberant, if not particularly subtle, a big, juicy wine to drink with steaks and roasts. Bone dry, and pretty tough in tannins, it has flavors of blackberries, leather, cola, coffee and pepper. Ready now.",,86,35.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Terlato
103298,US,"Dryness and herba notes mark this wine. Despite some rich oak influences, it comes down on the mineral and sage side, only vaguely suggesting fruitier notes of pineapples and peaches.",Stuhlmuller Vineyards Reserve,86,32.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Summers
103299,US,"Tastes very oaky, with vanilla and caramel flavors dominating the earthy pineapples and green apples. That earthiness shows up in the form of sage-like herbs. Ready now.",,86,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Oakville Ranch
103300,Spain,"Applesauce aromas are open and inoffensive, and the palate is wet and refreshing, with crisp, dry green apple and generic white fruit flavors. As a brut nature, it makes sense that the finish would be wet, lean and taste like lime-infused soda water.",Brut Nature Gran Reserva,86,16.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Sabartés
103301,Spain,"Light raspberry and plum aromas feature a side note of citrus peel, while the flavors are pure but rudimentary dark berry, plum and herb. Good body and structure, but not complex or layered. Finishes peppery and a touch bitter, with short-lasting fruit.",La Vendimia,86,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Palacios Remondo
103302,New Zealand,"Off-dry in style, with forward aromas of fresh pineapple and a touch of chalk dust, this is a medium-bodied Pinot Gris with plenty of ripe melon and red currant flavors balanced by a touch of apple skin on the finish.",,86,24.0,Nelson,,,Pinot Gris,Waimea
103303,France,"A fresh wine, its tannins attenuated initially, although they do then broaden into red berry and plum flavors. The tannins are soft and the wine is ready to drink.",Château des Proms Cuvée Bellevue,86,,Bordeaux,Graves,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Yvon Mau

103306,France,The nose displays some funky notes alongside pleasant mineral scents while the elegant palate is crisp and lemony. The short-to-medium finish ends on a grapefruit tone. Terrific choice for shellfish. Drink now.,Les Princes Abbés,85,15.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Blanc,Domaines Schlumberger
103307,Germany,"A charming wine at a fair price, with jump-out-of-the-glass potpourri scents backed up by lilies and a cut grass back note. It's a bit monotone in the mouth and has no great density but the pretty note of faded flower petals hangs around just long enough to make you forget all that. Drink up.",Noble House,85,13.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler
103308,France,"A direct wine, its acidity very linear to go with the dark tannins. The fruit is juicy, very black currant, with a stalky character. This is classic food-friendly Bordeaux, with a bright but dry finish.",Clos de la Vieille Eglise,85,,Bordeaux,Côtes de Castillon,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,D & R Dubois
103309,Spain,"Emilio Moro's first foray into the land of value-priced wine is good but nothing special. The nose is brambly and dusty, like the inside of a Topps baseball card package. Meanwhile, the palate is tight and lean, with cherry flavors infiltrated by dry oak. Overall it's typical of a solid but average red wine.",Finca Resalso,85,15.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
103310,Spain,"Condensed, syrupy cherry aromas are a little candied, while the palate is acidic and angular, with juicy, tomatoey cherry and plum flavors. Fairly tight and lean in the mouth, with just enough oak to create a mocha/cocoa accent on the finish. For the price, there isn't much body, variety of flavor or pleasantries.",Horizonte de Exopto,85,37.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Exopto
103311,US,"There's plenty of acid in this tart, sleek Chardonnay, and no obvious flavors from barrel aging or even malolactic fermentation. It's simple, crisp, and tastes of green apples with a hint of cinnamon.",,85,20.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Southern Oregon,Chardonnay,Del Rio
103312,Spain,"A mildly baked wine with a touch of raisin, brine and stem on the nose. The palate is grabby, with firm tannins and core flavors of cherry, blackberry and dry oak. Beyond that, there isn't a whole lot else on offer, and the fruit breaks up on the transition from palate to finish.",El Primavera,85,14.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Agrícola Labastida
103313,France,"A few years of age have added some interest to this Pinot Blanc. Toasted nuts and butter are the dominant notes now, though some zesty lemon flavor emerges on the finish. Crisp, light and subtle; a good choice for a contemplative moment.",Cuvée Les Amours,85,17.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Blanc,Hugel
103314,Australia,"Fresh and honest, this unoaked Chard has got a zingy lemon theme that permeates nose, palate and finish. Medium-bodied and crisp, an excellent choice for flounder in a lemon sauce. Drink now.",Unwooded,85,18.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Chardonnay,Hugo

103316,US,"The palate impression is of oak, lees and acidity, which give tart vanilla, buttered toast and sour cream flavors to an otherwise simple wine. When the palate searches for fruit, it finds modest pineapples, peaches and green apples.",,85,22.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Freemark Abbey
103317,US,"The oak stands out, offering buttered toast, caramel and vanilla notes that swamp the underlying wine, which has flavors of blackberries and blueberries. Certainly has some fancy tannins, but that woody overlay is unbalanced.",Estate Vineyards,85,36.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Burgess
103318,Spain,"Strawberry and raspberry aromas are a little stalky and stemmy, while the palate is entirely regular in feel, weight and flavor. Speaking of flavors, things run a little tart and herbal, while the finish has an acidic yet fresh zestiness. Midlevel in every way.",,85,14.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Beronia
103319,US,"Deeply colored for a rosé sparkling wine, and full bodied, with raspberry and cherry jam, vanilla wafer and yeasty, baked dough flavors. Slightly sweet, too. Champagne fans won't like it, but millions of ordinary consumers will.",Rosso Red Spumante,85,10.0,California,California,California Other,Sparkling Blend,Ballatore
103320,Australia,"A solid example of cool-climate Australian Cabernet, Yering Station's 2005 boasts slightly lifted aromas of dried spices and wintergreen, easing into cassis and mint on the palate. It's a bit austere and firm right now, worth holding 2–3 years. To drink now, pair with rare beef or lamb.",,88,18.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Yering Station
103321,Chile,"Very nice, with aromas of olive, herbal plum, bacon, salami and leather. It's fresh and lively in the mouth, but with some weight and heft. The flavors of raspberry, plum have a controlled herbal element, and the finish is long, clean and alert. A very healthy, well-made wine.",Special Reserve,88,12.0,Maule Valley,,,Carmenère,Simone
103322,US,"As usual, the Nina Lee Syrah is dark, chewy, and hits the mid-fifteens with its alcohol. But it somehow pulls together an impression of balance, highlighted by sweet and tangy blueberry/blackberry fruit. The acids are not quite integrated, and the wine has lost some subtlety – it has traded its elegance for sheer fruit power.",Nina Lee,88,50.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Spring Valley Vineyard
103323,US,"Scents of prune, coffee and smoke lead into a chewy, substantial wine with plenty of concentration. The cherry fruit has a syrupy character, and it's loaded with dark layers of coffee, licorice and char. The best of the new releases from Lone Canary.",,88,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Lone Canary
103324,France,"It is the blend of Malbec (Cot) and Cabernet Franc that gives this wine its intense, dry, tannic core. It is, though, all fruit as well, crisp plum skin textures and smoky black berry flavors. Despite the cooler year, this offers ripeness as well as taut, fresh acidity.",L'Antique des Cabotières,88,18.0,Loire Valley,Touraine,,Red Blend,Domaine Joël Delaunay
103325,US,"A good, rich wine, with concentrated flavors of blackberries, currants, black cherries, dark chocolate and sweet caramelized oak. Feels lush and soft through the finish. Drink now–2013.",Elodian,88,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Eddy Family
103326,Australia,"Not quite as intense or concentrated as Burge's Filsell Shiraz, but made in a similar style, with notes of roasted coffee and grilled meat accenting raspberry fruit. The tannins are creamy, balanced by crisp acids on the finish. Drink now–2013.",Miamba,88,27.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Grant Burge
103327,New Zealand,"This is a plump and rounded Chardonnay that manages to deliver citrus and melon fruit alongside ample notes of toasted grain. It's harmonious and elegant, leaving it extremely easy to drink now and over the next year.",,88,18.0,Marlborough,,,Chardonnay,Grove Mill
103328,New Zealand,"Burgundy purists might turn up their noses, but that's their loss, as Forrest's 2007 Pinot Noir offers a lush, round mouthful of black cherry fruit, providing ample drinking pleasure. Coffee and vanilla nuances are testament to its oak-derived complexity, helping the wine go down easily. Drink now.",,88,20.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Forrest Estate
103329,France,"Spicy and minty, here is a wine full of fresh, soft flavors, but given a backbone by some dusty, warm tannins. It is perfumed, the fruit given a vibrant edge, and demanding food. Drink now and over two years.",Cuvée Suptil,88,,Loire Valley,Anjou,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,Domaine de Montgilet
103330,France,"The Aubance is part of the network of small rivers that eventually flows into the Loire in Anjou. The appellation produces gently sweet wines like this one, from Chenin Blanc. This is as much fresh as sweet, with light ripe apple flavors and pear juice acidity. Drink now, but it is worth aging over five years.",,88,,Loire Valley,Coteaux de l'Aubance,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine de Montgilet
103331,Italy,"This is a deep wine with rich notes of barbecue, smoke and hickory over black fruit and spice.

103335,US,"The Frederick is Spring Valley's Bordeaux blend  and it would be nice to see Spring Valley turn it down a bit and bring back some of the toasted grain nuances that set it apart from the rest of the Walla Walla AVA. Instead, this piles on the sweet, jammy black fruit and new oak, and blows past the terroir.",Frederick Red Wine,88,50.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Spring Valley Vineyard
103336,US,"Young and nervy, with mouthwatering acidity and primary fruit flavors of blackberries, sour cherry candy, licorice and smoky oak. Fine now with a juicy steak, and could develop in the bottle for a few years.",Il Re Reserve,88,38.0,California,Red Hills Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Cabernet Sauvignon,Nordby
103337,New Zealand,"Made in a bold, fruit-driven style, the 2007 Pinot Noir from Nautilus places black cherry fruit front and center, surrounding it with just enough cola, mushroom and gentle spice to make for pleasing complexity. Acids and tannins are a bit firmer than most Marlborough Pinots, so try pairing it with roast lamb or beef.",,88,25.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Nautilus
103338,Chile,"A good and lively bargain-priced Chard. Light toast, honey and pear aromas draw you in, and the balanced white-fruit palate is convincing. Sophisticated and with good acidity.",Classic Series,88,12.0,Curicó Valley,,,Chardonnay,Montes
103339,US,"A first-time red blend from Nefarious. It's a bit lighter and smoother than the varietal reds, but still carries the winery's signature of firm acids, stiff tannins, layered aromas and tightly wound fruit. Red berries, currant, pomegranate and stone are the most noticeable flavors, with some pretty chocolate in the finish.",The Spinner Red Wine,88,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Nefarious Cellars

103342,Italy,"This deeply garnet-colored wine offers a very perfumed bouquet of church incense and potpourri. You'll also get background tones of Indian spice, dried lavender and hickory smoke. The wine is supple and smooth on the close.",Ronco dei Ciliegi,87,33.0,Central Italy,Forlì,,Sangiovese,Castelluccio

103345,Australia,"Starts off promising, with some dark fruit aromas and an attractive tea-like nuance, then delivers simpler, somewhat grapy fruit flavors. It's full bodied, but with a certain reserve or austerity to its mouthfeel, finishing firm. Probably best in another year or two.",Mountain Estate,87,14.0,Australia Other,Central Ranges,,Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon,Inkberry
103346,Chile,"A little herbal and green-ish, but not too much so. The nose has varietal aromas of pepper, bramble and oregano, but the palate is smooth and medium in depth, with cola, licorice and creamy vanilla accents working off a solid core of plum. Finishes reasonably long and warm.",Las Mercedes Reserva Especial,87,16.0,Maule Valley,,,Carmenère,J. Bouchon

103350,US,"There's no oak on this Viognier, so the fruit stands out, and what fruit it is.

Drink now.",,87,24.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Viognier,Rivino

103355,Australia,"Despite some very ripe fruit flavors and ample (14.5%) alcohol, this full-bodied Shiraz isn't particularly lush. The tannins are rich and velvety, but the acids are elevated and tartness dominates the finish. Drink it over the next several years.",,87,25.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Yangarra Estate Vineyard

103357,US,"A really wonderful wine that's dry and robust and frankly super-drinkable.

Great as a by-the-glass pour.",,87,10.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Red Blend,Road i Red
103358,US,"A tough, rugged, tannic young wine, brisk in acids and pepper, and not showing much opulence now. There's a molten core of blackberries and grilled, meaty leather, leading to a bone dry finish. Should mellow with 1–2 years in the bottle.",De Luxe,87,27.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,Manzanita Creek
103359,Spain,"Slightly saucy on the nose, with jammy, baked fruit aromas hinting at cherry and raspberry.

103360,Italy,"A standout at the tasting, the Chiarlo was made to be enjoyed with food. A complex palate offers lime peel mingled with apricot and peach; and there is plenty of acidity that allows the flavors to come through to a fine finish.",,87,18.0,Piedmont,Gavi,,Cortese,Michele Chiarlo
103361,Spain,"Aromas of Christmas spice, pepper and dried fruit fall more into the traditional category than modern, while the palate is snappy, a little lean and delivers strawberry and raspberry fruit with a light buttery oak note.

103362,Australia,"Aged partly in new American Oak hogsheads and partly in used French Oak barriques, the barrel regime shows in this wine's obvious vanilla and caramel accents to its boysenberry fruit. Supple and creamy in texture before turning crisp on the finish. Drink now.",Single Vineyard,87,30.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Longwood
103363,Italy,The nose is all gardenia and pear enveloped by citrus. The crisp palate doesn't have a great deal of intensity but compensates with very pleasant flavors of pear drop and nettle. Enjoy with fish in a citrus sauce.,,87,20.0,Piedmont,Gavi di Gavi,,Cortese,Bricco dei Guazzi
103364,Australia,"Although based in the Hunter, Brokenwood has reached into South Australia for this Shiraz, which offers lifted, rather perfumed aromas of raspberries and strawberries supported by vanilla underpinnings.

103369,Spain,"Much more fresh and perky than previous years, with grapefruit, nectarine and other citrusy aromas.

Drink now.",,87,18.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Godello,Abad Dom Bueno
103370,US,"Although the winery describes the oak on this wine as neutral, it seems to stick out. The flavors are dominated by buttered toast and vanilla honey. Then the lemons and limes kick in, with their undergirding of minerals. Gainey has good grapes, but needs to develop a better delineation between their regular and Limited Selection Sauvignon Blanc.",Limited Selection,87,18.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Gainey
103371,Argentina,"Mossy and quite woody, and maybe even bretty, but also rich and stout, with concentration.

Finishes surprisingly quick.",Reserva,87,20.0,Other,Neuquén,,Malbec,Valle Perdido
103372,US,"This seductive Cabernet Franc opens up with aromas of cherry, vanilla and spice leading into layers of blackberry, plum, cinnamon and cedar on the palate. Fruit and spice are balanced here, and medium tannins means the wine can age. Paired with roasted duck or beef, the wine is a sure hit.",,87,21.0,Virginia,Virginia,,Cabernet Franc,Veramar
103373,US,"A nervy young wine, marked by fruity acidity and primary flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, cocoa and spices, wrapped into strong tannins.

103375,US,"This rich Cabernet starts with aromas of vanilla, nutty oak and mocha, unfolding into flavors of ripe red berries, cedar, pepper and toast.

103376,Argentina,"Recent ratings have been consistent for this pricey Malbec-Petit Verdot-Tannat blend. The nose is woody and the fruit seems baked, and along the route you encounter a cheesy, horsey quality. Thick on the palate, with good structure and buttery flavors of strawberry and raspberry.

103382,Chile,"Grassy and gassy at first, with green olive, eucalyptus and salty raspberry flavors.

103387,Chile,"Maybe it's the Aconcagua fruit, but this is one funky beast.

103397,Chile,"For several years running this wine has failed to show any improvement.

103646,Chile,"Burly aromas of mint, leather, shoe polish, olive and herbs all come together fairly well, and the palate is alive with fruit, especially red cherry and plum. A second layer of heat, chocolate and raspberry carry oaky remnants of toast and spice, and overall it comes across as a real wine waiting to be drunk.",,87,19.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Merlot,Arboleda
103647,Chile,"Rich, with thick but appealing tar, chocolate and blackberry aromas. The acidity, tannins and structure all seem right. Flavors of bright berry and plum are youthful and friendly, and there's a hint of vanilla to the finish. Decidedly not herbal or forced.",Reserva,87,18.0,Curicó Valley,,,Carmenère,Aresti
103648,US,"Very ripe, rich and full-bodied, a gutsy wine front-loaded with jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, plums, raspberries, mocha and anise. Young, and should age for a while, but luscious now with tri-tip.",Dreamer,87,23.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Petite Sirah,Clavo Cellars

103650,Chile,"Round and plump, but also noticeably saucy and herbal both on the nose and in the mouth. This has a baked, roasted set of aromas followed by herbal, modest red-fruit flavors and sticky tannins. Big, herbal and only just adequate.",Reserva,83,10.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Merlot,Veramonte
103651,Chile,"Quite ripe but also sort of flat and syrupy. The nose shows blueberry and licorice, while the saturated palate is creamy thick, with herbal/berry flavors. Both mocha and peppery notes sit on the chewy, borderline gummy finish.",,83,7.0,Maule Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Simone
103652,Chile,"Light and leafy Merlot is what this is, plain and simple. There just isn't a lot of substance to this besides a decent mouthfeel that wraps itself around tomato leaf, cranberry and carob flavor. Even some oaky vanilla and mocha can't push it.",Specal Reserve,83,10.0,Maule Valley,,,Merlot,Simone
103653,Chile,"A sweet, plump, candied wine. Viognier (19%) is blended into Chardonnay and the result centers on tropical guava and white fruits like pear and peach. It gets heavier and flatter as it goes along.",El Delirio Reserve,83,11.0,Central Valley,,,Chardonnay-Viognier,Botalcura

103655,Italy,"There's a dirty, earthy element to this wine that covers up the fresh cherry fruit and makes it difficult to identify the true personality of the otherwise delicate and vibrant Sangiovese variety. That earthy element does blow off with time in the glass to reveal fresh cherry, spice and pretty vanilla flavors.",,83,,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,I Fabbri
103656,Chile,"Slightly candied raspberry and cherry aromas don't last for long as the palate goes chunky, herbal and mulchy, with heavy, borderline green flavors. Olive, green herbs and berries leave a mild, grabby finish.",Winemaker's Selection,83,14.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,In Situ

103661,Chile,"Vanilla and pear aromas strongly hint at sweetness, and the palate delivers melon and pineapple flavors but not much balance or elegance. It's a fleshy, soft, overly fruity wine that stumbles to the finish line.",Reserva,83,12.0,Bío Bío Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Porta
103662,US,"Ripe and peppery, this rustic wine offers easy flavors of wild forest blackberries, blueberries and red berries and caramelized oak. It's pretty tannic, and calls to mind comfort foods.

103663,Chile,"The inkly purple color indicates a lot: this is a huge, overextracted type of blend that treads heavily from start to finish.

103682,Spain,"Aromas of rubber, smoked beef, syrupy berry and buttery oak are inviting enough, while the palate has edgy acidity that pushes the wine's black cherry element while cutting an obvious oak dosage.

Crisp and a good food wine.",Crianza,87,22.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Vallobera

103690,Australia,"The aromas of this Shiraz are surprisingly dark; they tend toward the blackberry and cola end of the spectrum, while the flavors are more reminiscent of stewed berries with a touch of cinnamon.

103698,Spain,"Dark purple in color, with can't-miss aromas of prune and raisin. The palate is predictably soft, with manageable heft but low acidity and thus very soft edges.

103829,Chile,"Light and airy, with red fruit and tea aromas. The palate is fairly acidic but not harsh or sour; flavors of pie cherry are balanced and sweetened by caramel, yet the finish is lean and quick, with citrus peel and zest.

103831,Spain,"For the most part this is smooth, ripe red wine. At 50% Cabernet and 50% Merlot the flavors and style should be familiar, but still this wine has its own Catalonian personality. It's concentrated and ripe but not all that heavy. Overall it's very Mediterranean/mountainous and not very New World at all. A fine match for good food.",Abadal Crianza,88,15.0,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Masies d'Avinyo

Verges on elegant.",Brut Nature Gran Reserva Cava,88,15.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Sparkling Blend,Sumarroca
103834,US,"A very distinctive 100% Cab that some might even find controversial. It's ripe almost to the point of supermaturity, showing powerful currant and licorice flavors that are very well oaked.

103838,Spain,"Savory mint and herbal aromas accent leafy, classic red fruit on the bouquet, while plum, berry, mineral, black olive and herbs work the palate.

103841,US,"Edmeades' longtime winemaker is Van Williamson, nicknamed “Vanimal,” and he makes big, bold reds. This may be his highest-alcohol ever.

103844,Spain,"Tempranillo and Cabernet Franc aren't often thrown together, but here the marriage works. The nose offers herbal, leafy aromas from the CF, while berry fruit and oak carry the rest of the show. The palate is slightly crisp and racy, but its lightweight character is welcome.

103845,Spain,"Darker red in color, with a dusty, full bouquet. Flavors of plum, raspberry and apple skins are appealing and on the money, as is the mouthfeel and the fresh, drying finish.

103851,US,"Fresh, clean and frankly delicious, this Sauvignon Blanc, which doesn't seem to have any wood on it, tastes like a romp through an orchard.

103857,US,"Shows the earthiness that often marks young Calera Pinot, which makes it less flashy but more elegant and food-friendly than many more expensive wines.

103858,Portugal,"It's the Antão Vaz, the Chardonnay of Portugal, that gives this such class. It is full, tasty and complex, with acidity and superripeness, but still elegant white fruits.

103860,Spain,"A barrel-heavy blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo? That's what this is, so expect popcorn and bland white fruit along with plenty of acidity.

103926,Italy,"Casale Triocco does a nice job with its 2005 Sagrantino di Montefalco but ultimately we like the 2006 Rosso di Montefalco just as much.

103929,Italy,Lungarotti plants a small percentage of new vineyards each year in order to renew the holdings of this historic estate.

103931,Australia,"Shows a dark, savory side of Shiraz in its aromas of blueberries, blackberries and black olives, then adds some espresso-like notes on the palate.

103935,Chile,"Mildly herbal black-fruit aromas carry notes of tea and bell pepper, but it's not decidedly vegetal.

103936,US,"This new, nonvintage version of McCrea's Cotes du Rhône-style blend is an interesting wine, with far more complexity than most inexpensive red blends from Washington.

103941,US,"Aged in barrel (mostly new) for 22 months, this 84% Merlot/16% Cabernet Sauvignon really shows the new oak and vanilla scents and flavors, but that is to be expected at this stage of the game.

103943,US,"The aging in 40% American oak shows in a somewhat pickley note; this still seems to be a bit disjointed, although it's been in bottle almost a full year. It's 100% Cabernet Sauvignon; along with clear varietal character, there are overly strong flavors of bark and herb, and the finish is austere and a little chewy.",,87,34.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Otis Kenyon

103952,Italy,"It took a few minutes to wake the Principessa up; but when she did, there were plenty of bright summer fruit aromas, which seemed to come rushing out as if to make up for lost time.

103954,Italy,"Fontanafredda's Moscato d'Asti is a cut above its competitors, with intense orange, grape and pear aromas that lead into a palate of white grapes and ground cherries.

103961,Italy,"This wine gives the impression of having been pushed just a bit too far, with a nose and palate dominated by vanilla and mocha notes imparted by small oak barrels.

103967,Italy,"Really charming, with a nose of green plums, red berries and earth that jumps out of the glass and curls up in your lap. The palate is lacking a bit in intensity but makes up for it with iresistable cassis flavor followed by fresh-roasted coffee.

103974,Spain,"Lean, focused cherry and raspberry aromas properly portend a snappy, fresh, edgy palate of semitart red plum and raspberry flavors.

103987,Chile,"For Odfjell, which normally puts out ripe, quality wines, this green, herbal Syrah is both surprising and disappointing.

103990,US,"The age of this wine, nearly 5 years, makes you wonder why Hawley held it back so long. Maybe to let the harshness resolve. If so, it didn't work. It remains a bitter wine, with overripe, Porty flavors.",,80,25.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Hawley
103991,US,"It's been an uphill battle for Pietra Santa with this variety, and the '05 doesn't help matters. The wine is harsh in acids, with modest cherry and herb flavors and an annoyingly astringent finish.",,80,18.0,California,Cienega Valley,Central Coast,Dolcetto,Pietra Santa

103993,France,"This is a powerhouse of a wine. It is driven forward by immense tannins as well as by superrich fruit that still keeps itself in check by a velvet texture. There is spice, acidity, some toast and vanilla, and finally a sunburst of warmth.",,98,138.0,Burgundy,Clos de la Roche,,Pinot Noir,Louis Jadot
103994,France,"A complete wine. As it starts in the mouth, there is a feeling of everything in its place.

103995,France,"A beautiful wine, smooth, polished, with rounded corners. Its intense fruit is balanced and harmonizes well with the sweet tannins, the layers of wood and the red berry flavors.

A straight line of pure flavor all the way to the finish.",,98,,Burgundy,Clos de Lambrays,,Pinot Noir,Domaine des Lambrays
103997,US,"The fragrance is almost otherworldly; sweet, dense and lightly lifted. This is a sinewy wine, that begins with compact power and focused, tart red fruits—predominantly raspberry and currant.

103999,US,"This very expensive release is one of the rare examples of Chardonnay that absolutely requires bottle age. Dry and leesy now, with a mineral compactness, it shows a rich core of baked peach, spiced apple, butterscotch and smoky honey. As it warms in the glass, it develops great flavor and textural complexities.

104000,France,"Beautiful, aromatic wine, with raspberry fruit floating above the spice and toast.

104001,US,"Bob Betz calls this his first-ever “reserve style” wine from Bordeaux varieties. It started with a single barrel of Red Willow Cabernet Franc and evolved into this six-barrel blend. Le Parrain opens with whiffs of smoke, gun metal and rock weaving through the dense red fruits. Pipe tobacco and licorice flavors come into play from the barrel aging. As the wine slowly opens, the flavors expand and blend, and the textural quality that Betz refers to expresses itself in a graceful, three-dimensional finish.",Le Parrain Red Wine,96,85.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Betz Family
104002,Spain,"Dalmau, the ultrapremium Tempranillo blend from Marques de Murrieta, is 65% pricier in 2004 than '03. And that might be justified. This is a spectacular wine in every sense of the word. The nose blends alluring scents of smoke, asphalt, rubber and black fruit. The palate is saturated and smooth, with black cherry and blackberry flavors leading the way.

104003,Austria,"Willi Bründlmayer uses the lyre canopy, open in the center like the ancient lyre of classical times, in part of the Heiligenstein vineyard.

104004,US,"If you know Goldeneye's new Gowen Creek bottling, this is a near identical Pinot, and little wonder, for the vineyards are right next to each other.

104006,Spain,"For the second vintage in a row, Vall Llach's signature red blend is out on its own. The bouquet is round and deep, with alluring cola, mint and blackberry aromas.

Delicious but also deft. 450 cases produced.",,95,85.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Vall Llach
104007,France,"Opulent yet so elegant, this wine has already achieved great balance. It comes from the soft richness of the generous fruit, the spice from both the wood and the fruit, and the roundness of the texture, which envelops you in its warmth and ripeness.

104099,New Zealand,"For under $10, this is a medium-bodied, slightly soft Sauvignon Blanc that's a good introduction to Marlborough.

104107,Chile,"A little earthy and leafy on the nose and palate, but we like the wine's balance and saturation as well as its flavors of herbal cherry and berry.

104108,Chile,"Forceful on the nose, with herbal, saucy, rubbery aromas. It's weighty in the mouth, with blackberry, herbal tomato and dry spice flavors.

104109,Italy,"The oak element is strong here—very strong—and one wonders if it will ever fully integrate even with more years of aging in the bottle. There's not much fruit left and what you do get is ripe and jammy. You can feel the alcohol at the back. Otherwise, the wine is dense and smooth on the palate.",Conca del Grillo,85,19.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Silvano Bolmida
104110,Chile,"Starts out kind of murky and pasty, with gummy black fruit and compost aromas. Airing helps it escape that shell, and in the mouth there's rubbery blueberry flavors mixed with mildly tart rhubarb and bramble.

104127,Australia,"Renowned for its restraint and fine-ness, Mount Mary is an icon of Australian wine, and one that seems to perplex many American critics, including this one.

104132,US,"The vineyard is in a cool area of this sprawling appellation southwest of Sebastopol, but the heat of the vintage shows in the wine's relative softness and ripeness of fruit.

104133,Spain,"Vionta aims for the racy, lively style of Albariño, and for the most part it nails it.

Some weight underneath hints at the Chardonnay.",Alvarinho-Chardonnay,88,,Estremadura,,,Portuguese White,DFJ Vinhos
104144,US,"Represents a big improvement over last year's Califa; this one returns to dryness thanks to the cool vintage. Edna Valley acidity brightens cherry, root beer, vanilla bean and oak flavors.

104147,Spain,"May be getting old but still welcoming and mostly fresh. Citrus, melon and mango flavors are flush and clean, and the finish is racy and fluid.

104154,US,"The vineyard is in the cool Edna Valley, and in this cool vintage, this wine has lots of bright, crunchy acidity. It's also bone dry.

104176,Spain,"For a Priorat red, this is lean and snappy, with hot, stemmy aromas and light-bodied, racy fruit flavors.

104187,US,"Distinctive, with a strong flavor of cherry—much beyond the usual cherry found in many red wines. The fruit is backed with stiff tannins, slightly herbal, and a streak of vanilla/caramel.

104189,Spain,"A touch stalky on the nose, but after that it gets things mostly right. The fruit aromas and flavors are subdued, with jammy raspberry notes leading the way.

104197,US,"A bold, muscular, striking wine with nerves of steel, this offers a dense, demanding array of black fruit threaded with veins of espresso, smoke, tar, tobacco and iron.

Really remarkable for the flood of golden mango, Asian pear and Key lime pie richness, which is grounded by a firm minerality.

104269,US,"Dry and tannic, with a hard mouthfeel and not enough richness to get past the goal line.

Not an ager, so drink up.",Narrative,86,30.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hans Fahden
104270,US,"A dry, tannic and severe Syrah. It's tart and sandpapery in the mouth, with a scoury mouthfeel, and although you'll find some cherries and currants, there's not enough richness to counterbalance the toughness.",Paradise Road,86,30.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,Jalama
104271,US,"This red has a fruity, jammy nose with a peppery kick. On the palate it's a mixture of spicebox, cherry, coffee and pepper. Approachable and well made—a good everyday drinking red.",Campania Rosso,86,30.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Red Blend,Waters Crest
104272,US,"Soft and fruity, a gently tannic, easy and slightly sweet Zinfandel to drink now with barbecue and beef tacos. It's filled with jammy blackberries, cherries, black raspberries, chocolate and spices.",Ellie's Old Vine Vineyard,86,32.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Wilson
104273,US,"Shows the hard, bigtime tannins of this important mountain appellation and also its tightly wound blackberry and currant flavors, with their dusting of herbs.

104276,Argentina,"For everyday consumption, this is good Cabernet with rousing fruit, body and pulse. The nose has smoke, rubber, pepper and cured meat to go with berry and cassis aromas, and the palate is very fruity, driving and loaded with flavorful cherry, raspberry and plum fruit. Not refined but good and honest.",,86,11.0,Other,San Juan,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tour 52
104277,Australia,"This ambitious offering from Two Hands is a bit of dissappointment. The bold black cherry fruit seems slightly cooked or raisiny, and there's a grassy, herbal element as well. But it's also nicely concentrated and weighty, with a mouthwatering finish that redeems it.",Max's Garden,86,60.0,Victoria,Heathcote,,Shiraz,Two Hands
104278,Spain,"Opens with tight black cherry and raspberry aromas, but also a whiff of pine and chemical.

104279,US,"A bit aggressive in tannins, with a sharp, sandpapery bite, and the flavors don't give enough richness to balance that roughness.

104282,US,"This is DuBrul vineyard fruit, and the wine is fine-tuned, round and fruity, with lovely toasty oak underlying ripe black cherry fruit.

104283,France,"For a Clos de Vougeot, this is at first surprisingly mineral. Only as the wine opens in the mouth do you find this beautiful ripe fruit, an explosion of red berries driven forward by black plum skin flavors and dark tannins. It is certainly powerful, but manages to wear its power lightly.",Clos de Vougeot,94,155.0,Burgundy,Clos de Vougeot,,Pinot Noir,Domaine de la Vougeraie
104284,Argentina,"Argentino is a Malbec made from two vineyards: Adrianna in Tupungato and Nicasia in Vista Flores/Altamira. Aged for two years in new oak, it's a dark, vibrant masculine wine with excellent depth of flavor, seductive berry flavors, and lots of length. It hits with force but also finesse, and it shows the extracted richness that comes from small-lot open bin fermentation.",Argentino,94,120.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
104285,US,"Several factors go into making this Chardonnay as extraordinary as it is. One is Carneros itself, which produces vibrant, crisp, fruit-filled grapes. Second is the Shafer approach of fermenting the wine in both stainless steel and oak barrels, giving a complexity of textures and brightnesses. The use of natural or wild yeasts may also contribute to complexity, while a firm decision against malolactic fermentation preserves vital acidity. The result is a compelling, layered wine whose tropical fruit, mineral, buttered toast and creme brulée flavors are in near-perfect harmony and balance.",Red Shoulder Ranch,94,47.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Shafer
104286,France,"The oldest property owned by the Drouhin family has produced a wine that is initially withdrawn, showing its herbal, earthy character, before releasing an explosion of sweet berries, spice and irresistible freshness and acidity.

104288,US,"Very full-bodied and rich, offering a wealth of ripe fruit and even some dry, gritty tannins, this will stand some time in the cellar. It's explosive in red and black cherry pie, currant, raspberry and cola flavors, with a rich edge of melted milk chocolate, and the vanilla spice and caramel of new oak. Just a tremendous palate experience.",Garys' Vineyard,94,52.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,La Rochelle
104289,France,"Full of coffee, wood, small black plums and chocolate, this is an exciting wine, with richness allied to round sweet fruits.

104290,France,"This wine's dark red color is a giveaway for its power.

104291,Austria,"You can hear the richness of this wine as you pour it. Then the richness, the sweetness and the intense acidity burst out of the glass.

Age for many years.",Zöbinger Heiligenstein Beerenauslese,94,99.0,Kamptal,,,Riesling,Bründlmayer
104292,Argentina,"Talk about a deep, luscious wine. The bouquet emits a magnetic blend of chocolate cake, fine leather and berry marmalade, while the midsection is downright delicious but also very pure and natural despite the wine seeing 20 months of new oak. ACrux catches and holds every note, and it should age well for another 5 to 8 years.",Alfa Crux,94,45.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,O. Fournier
104293,US,"This is an amazing wine. It's bone-dry and very high in acidity, one of the most distinctive white wines in California. The racy quality supports intense flavors of steely minerals, orange and lime zest and apricots, wrapped into a rich, oily texture. It accomplishes the magic of tasting honey-sweet but finishing thoroughly dry. Will age, too. A 2001, tasted alongside, was terrific.",,94,19.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Muscat Blanc,Navarro
104294,Argentina,"A big, floral, fruity wine with all the hallmarks of excellence. The fruit is exacting, ripe and healthy, the tannins are firm, and the acidity is just right.

104295,Austria,"The sweetness is initially overwhelming, like drinking syrup.

The finish is still sweet, but the spice gives a parting lift.",Ried Loiser Berg Trockenbeerenauslese,93,108.0,Kamptal,,,Grüner Veltliner,Bründlmayer
104296,Austria,"If Riesling is known to pick up tastes from its terroir, then this wine is a perfect example. The sandstone of the Heiligenstein hill gives such intense minerality that at this youthful stage it dominates all the fruit. The peaches, ripe tropical flavors are glints at the moment, but then this great wine is set to take its time.",Zöbinger Heiligenstein,93,42.0,Kamptal,,,Riesling,Bründlmayer

104298,Germany,"Hints of dried apricot mark the nose and palate, adding an additional layer of complexity to its standout notes of ripe apple, pear, honey and orange zest.

104300,Australia,"Part of what is supposed to be a global ultrapremium wine brand, Oriel's Sygnet Shiraz is a terrific effort, made with the help of John Duval (ex Penfolds).

Drink 2012–2025.",Sygnet,93,75.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Oriel
104301,US,"The bright berry fruit of  Merlot is beautifully matched to the structure and fragrance of Cabernets. There's a hint of volatility, just enough to give the wine lift and power. It's masterful how this is balanced and blended; every component enhances the whole. Spice, herb, tart red fruit, tannin, earth and rock all combine in a beautiful mix that resonates through a long, satisfying finish.",Red Wine,93,42.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Owen Roe
104302,France,"Intense and concentrated, this epitomizes the richness of 2005.

104304,US,"Shows the inky black color, thick sandpaper tannins and dryness that mark the best of North Coast Petite Sirah. Those qualities make the wine a bit hard and closed now, but the flavors are a real buried treasure. Blackberries, currants, licorice, beef jerky, cola, sweet leather, it's a tremendous swirl of complexity. If you must drink soon, decant. Otherwise the wine will effortlessly ride out the next 20 years.",Heritage Vineyards Orpheus,93,30.0,California,Redwood Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Petite Sirah,Lolonis
104305,France,"Made from the old vines of Clos de l'Arlot (average age 65 years), this is a wonderfully smoky, aromatic wine, with delicious raspberry fruits over dense wood and smoked bacon flavors.

104306,US,"This is superb, with honest, unadulterated flavors that reflect the power and precision of Yakima Valley Cabernet. The dominant note, apart from the cassis and cherry fruit, is tobacco, with hints of mint, herb and earth.

104307,US,"You'll want to give a few months in the cellar to this Pinot. It's dark and ripe, and shows the supple, silky tannins Pinot is known for. The flavors are enormously complex.

104311,Australia,"Despite being a 2004 vintage wine, this top-shelf Chardonnay from Penfolds is still embryonic in its development, shrouded in some smoky, tarry, coffee-like aromas that call for brisk decanting.

Drink now–2015.",Yattarna,91,66.0,South Australia,Henty,,Chardonnay,Penfolds
104312,Italy,"Green aromas of bell pepper, cracked peppercorn and leafy spinach give the Cabernet component away but are rendered manageable and less pronounced thanks to the wine's softer Merlot side.

104313,Italy,"A smoky, masculine Cab-Merlot blend with deep highlights of cigar box, old spice, black cherry and leather.

104314,Spain,"Méntrida is an island wine region in the middle of central Spain, and this blend of Garnacha and Syrah is lively, juicy and delicious. The nose is deep and luscious, with mounds of cassis and blackberry. The spunky palate shows big tannins but plenty of offsetting fruit and pulp. Finishing notes of chocolate and pepper leave a positive lasting impression. Should age for several more years; 400 cases produced.",,91,24.0,Central Spain,Mentrida,,Grenache-Syrah,Tres Patas
104315,US,"Fans of this variety will find something really interesting here. While the wine has the bigtime wild berry, chocolate, leather and spice flavors that Petite Sirah so dependably produces, it also boasts alcohol below 14%, giving it welcome balance.

104316,US,"The question is whether or not this wine will age, for it sure is tannic. Burns from entry to exit, and it's not the alcohol, which is modest. It's a very ripe, fruity Bordeaux blend, brimming with blackberry, cherry, licorice and cola flavors, and is flat-out delicious, except for those astringent tannins. Give it until sometime in 2008, and it should drink well for an additional six years.",,91,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Used Automobile Parts
104317,Italy,"Il Tesoro is a pure expression of Merlot.

It imparts deliciously soft, velvety tannins in the mouth.",Il Tesoro,91,43.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Merlot,Terrabianca
104318,Spain,"So thick and rich that it seems to fall apart in the mouth in pieces. There's rum raisin on the bouquet and then backing aromas and flavors of prune, orange rind, toffee, peanut and chocolate. It's rich, sweet and unctuous from start to finish, but with just enough balance and acidity to keep it upright. Sincere and delicious.",Premium Sweet Sherry 1827,91,20.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Pedro Ximénez,Osborne
104319,Spain,"A clear step up from the overdone 2003 Propiedad, this vintage is sweet and easy to like. There's a blast of hickory smoke on the new-oak nose, but also black fruit and molasses. The ripe palate deals chewy fruit, medium tannins and moderate length. It's a charming but blunt wine, and all in all it's probably not one to hold for too long. Drink now through 2009.",Propiedad,91,40.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Palacios Remondo
104320,US,"Few wines out of Napa Valley need age as much as this one does. That's due to its mountain origins and the cool vintage, which combine to make the tannins pushy and hard. But once they start to fall out, the blackberry and currant flavors should emerge, pure and sweet.

104322,Portugal,"The estate wine from Casal Branco is impressive and structured, with dried berry fruits, dark, dry tannins and a solid structure.

104323,Spain,"Having never tried this producer's wines, we can only heap praise on this medium-bodied, more modern style of Rioja. Bacon, rubber and raspberry work the bouquet, while the palate is ripe and full as it pumps forth with pure red-fruit flavors.

104325,US,"This marvelous vineyard has not been featured by Elk Cove previously.

104326,US,"Lush enough to drink now, with decanting, but this powerfully ripe Chard will benefit from limited aging. It's explosive in oak-infused pineapple, papaya, peach, green apple and Asian spice flavors, but right now the oak is not integrated with the fruit, making for a disjointed quality.

104331,Spain,"These are the kinds of Best Buys we love. In the case of Muruve's '04 crianza, the wine overdelivers by a sum and a half. The nose brims with cola, tar, menthol and other dark aromas, while the big but balanced palate delivers a belt of blackberry and plum flavors along with chewy, ripe tannins.

104344,US,"Griva Vineyard is supersensitive to the slightest vintage variation. The chilly 2011 harvest has given just enough sweet tropical-fruit flavor to balance out the tart gooseberry note.

104345,Chile,"This is burnished gold in color, with strong aromas of honey, noble rot and exotic spice.

104366,Portugal,"Showcasing the richness of 2009 without sacrificing fine structure, this is stylish and concentrated. Dark black fruit accompanies a tight, minerality and a fine shaft of acidity.

104388,US,"The concentrated apple juice aromas on this off-dry Riesling have a dark, caramelized sugar note that carries through on the palate as well.

104413,US,"Although this Cab is nearly seven years old, it's still hard and tough in tannins, and the tart acidity suggests it will remain unbalanced for the rest of its life.

104577,Spain,"Dark and powerfully oaked despite its 5-month pedigree. Mint, tar, shoe polish and blackberry work the bouquet, while the palate is structured and tight but also quite dark and woody.

104580,Germany,"Prospective purchasers should bear in mind that this wine was harvested at sugar levels far beyond the minimum spätlese requirements. This is more of a big auslese or small beerenauslese in terms of sugar and style, marrying dried apricot aromas with notes of candied pineapple and spice.

104585,Spain,"All three Vall Llach wines are stellar in 2005 and get Editors' Choice status. Idus is a big load that starts out sharp and toasty and then quickly settles into a saturated groove of black fruit, licorice, coffee and mocha.

104594,Argentina,"Never in its young history has the Clos 7 blend tasted this good right away. The '06 shows excellent young aromas of charcoal, black pepper and blackberry.

104597,US,"Though not as powerful and concentrated as the Spofford Station Syrah, this wine displays the same distinctive, complex flavor palette—a mix of earth, herb, compost, fungus, smoke, rock and, oh yeah, baby, oodles of fruit.

104696,US,"Albariño works in California when it's completely dry and minerally, because the variety's high acidity and citrus flavors make for a crisp, mouthwatering wine. The trouble with this one is that it's not dry. It has sugary citrus flavors, and that makes it acceptable but disappointing from this fine producer.",Las Brisas Vineyard,84,18.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Albariño,Mahoney

104700,South Africa,"The sweet edge to this sparkler makes it quite attractive and a pleasant alternative to the more common dry styles typically served today. The nose offers notes of toast, apple skins and pineapple core while the mouth shows riper flavors of peaches and cream and a hint of honey. Overall, a fun and well-balanced semi-sweet sparkler.",Bliss Demi-Sec,85,16.0,Western Cape,,,Champagne Blend,Graham Beck

104736,Spain,"Initially, lemony aromas and flower notes stir interest, while the palate has a medium-to-full feel and pumped-up melon and floral flavors.

104867,Argentina,"A strange set of aromas makes for an unusual bouquet: violets, black cherry, flower-scented air freshener and blueberry are all part of the picture.

104868,Spain,"No one says Verdejo is an ager, but this '08 is fading. The nose is soft and peachy, with weight and vanilla.

Brilliant winemaking.",Rosa Mystica,92,42.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Franc,Owen Roe
104923,France,"Mineral and initially austere, this is a reticent wine. The red berry fruits are there, but they are packed inside dry tannins.

104926,Germany,"This is a rather big and burly wine for a Mosel spätlese, weighing in at 11.5% alcohol. And while it shows plenty of power, it also shows nuance in its aromas and flavors, which range from baked fruit, honey and spiced marmalade to oily, mineral essences.

105042,Germany,"Lush aromas of mango and lychee are contradicted by the austere structure of this wine. The acidity is severe and the finish, though it shows some nice nut tones, ends on a drying note. Drink now.",Trocken,84,,Rheinhessen,,,Riesling,Weingut Liebfrauenstift
105043,Spain,"Straightforward and clean, with simple cherry and plum aromas. The palate is tart, juicy and a touch citric, with lightweight cherry skin flavors and a cleansing, fresh, somewhat acidic finish. Tangy and sharp, but not bad for the price.",,84,8.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Tempranillo,Vega Sindoa
105044,France,"The ludicrously heavy bottle must have cost more than the pleasant, fruity wine inside. The wood aging has had the effect of rounding the red berry fruits, while the juicy acidity points up freshness.",,84,10.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Vincent Saincrit
105045,Australia,"Zippy and zesty, with scents of fresh lime, cut grass and passionfruit, this is a nose that's firing on all cylinders. There could be more intensity in the mouth, but you'll be too distracted by the pretty pine and crisp lemon notes to notice. A great choice with light shellfish. Drink up.",,84,8.0,Australia Other,Australia-New Zealand,,Sauvignon Blanc,Yellow Tail

105047,US,"Old-fashioned Barbera, and seems pricey for a wine this dry, tannic and acidic. The coffee and black currant flavors are very tart. Needs superrich meats and cheeses to soften it.",Special Reserve,84,30.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Barbera,Latcham
105048,Australia,"A mineral-propelled style, with scents of wet stones couched in a bed of quince paste and brioche toast.

105051,Spain,"Not bad for a mass-produced wine. The nose has a distinct sweet, candied character that's like marshmallow, and there's also some burnt stem and bramble thrown into the mix.

105054,Spain,"For $7 this white blend from central Spain does about as well as can be hoped for. Transparent in color, with aromas of children's vitamin and apple, it's nothing special but it is wet, drinkable and tasty.

Decent, but not going anywhere.",Tondre Grapefield,84,28.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,De Tierra
105056,Australia,"The raspberry-inflected nose shows some farm aromas of manure and horse sweat.

Drink up.",,84,9.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Shiraz,Kilda
105057,Spain,"Catchy name but the wine is basic. The nose is lightly candied with a bit of green and brine.

105061,US,"The dryness hits you first, then the tannins. This is a Syrah that's hard and astringent, almost aggressive.

One to watch, if the winemaker can manage those bigtime tannins.",,87,30.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Syrah,River Star
105062,South Africa,"The smoked meat and spice on the nose of this consistently good Cabernet give it an exotic South African appeal, but the wine goes beyond merely unique.

105067,US,"There's a ton of Cabernet flavor here. The California sunshine of this warm appellation ripened the grapes to cassis and black cherry perfection.

105077,US,"Showing jammy blackberry and cherry flavors and lots of new smoky oak, this is a young, tannic Cab.

105083,France,"This late-harvest Gewürztraminer boasts hints of dried apricot on the nose to go along with scents of pineapple and spice. It's a gingery-peppery spice note that persists through the palate and onto the finish, joined by ripe pear flavors.

105160,US,"An interesting wine. It comes from a southerly part of Napa Valley many consider too cool for fine Cab. But this was a warm vintage. The result is very ripe fruit, wrapped in robust, hard tannins that make the wine too young to drink now.

105409,France,"A wine that is both fruity and almost approachable now, it is packed with the great structure of Pauillac Cabernet Sauvignon.

105429,Italy,"You'll encounter luscious fruit here with big flavors of peach, pear and passion fruit. Pinot Grigio from sunny Central Italy tends to show creamier structure and mature or sweet fruit aromas; this wine is a good example of that.",,86,15.0,Central Italy,Umbria,,Pinot Grigio,Lungarotti

105431,Chile,"Generally speaking we are big fans of Odfjell's wines, but not so much the Syrah. This vintage is a step up from the overdone, overoaked 2005. It has floral, high-toned berry and plum aromas and more than a kiss of vanillin and cream. The palate is tight, a bit lemony and woody, with forward flavors of red fruits, cola and mint.

105438,US,"The Merlot is blended with 10% Cabernet Franc, scented with black olive, herb and fresh berries.

105440,Chile,"Slightly oily and nutty on the nose, but mostly you get orange peel and citrus blossom.

105444,Chile,"The nose is dusty, with apple and banana aromas leading to a palate that's plump and tastes entirely of green apple and melon.

105446,US,"The nose is fruity and candied, with melon, apple, some sweet citrus.

105447,New Zealand,"The entry-level Chardonnay from Kumeu River gives just a taste of what heights its Chardonnays can achieve.

105450,Spain,"The wines of Abelis Carthago are enigmatic. The lowest-priced Lui is the most balanced and complete. This wine, William, is dark and dense, with shoe polish and raw crude oil on the nose. It's super strapping and tannic, with bitter chocolate and coffee notes carrying the racy palate to a fiery finish. It lacks nuance and subtlety but will augment a good steak with nary a problem.",William Selection,90,34.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Abelis Carthago
105451,Portugal,"Only the second garrafeira (the name means special selection) made by the Borba cooperative, this is a serious, complex wine that wears its tannins and rich fruits lightly.

105460,Italy,"For an entry-level wine, Rosso dei Notri is a sophisticated and compelling red.

105516,US,"This pure Syrah from Reininger's estate vineyard has the focus and also the tightness that often characterize single-vineyard wines.

105522,France,"A blend from several premier cru vineyards in Pommard, here is a wine that exhibits just the right firm but dusty tannins of the appellation.

105525,US,"Syrah and Dry Creek Valley have long been good partners, and this dry, rich wine shows why.

105531,Austria,"Bründlmayer makes a particularly felicitous brut, crisp, yeasty, with very pure green and white fruits.

105534,US,"Opulence is the winery's reserve Syrah, and it is a robust, tooth-staining wine that takes no prisoners. Dense scents suggest a pig roast on a pile of licorice sticks; the aromas are almost visceral. The fruit has been very well handled and the tannins, though full and powerful, have been polished to a satiny sheen. There's a little chalkiness to the finish, perhaps from acidification, but that may well resolve with a little more bottle age.",Opulence,91,40.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Syrah,Coeur d'Alene
105535,Argentina,"There is a select group of under-$20 Malbecs from Argentina that really do the country and the variety proud.

105539,Germany,"Made in a powerful, almost dry style with 12% alcohol, this is not a typical kabinett.

105665,Spain,"Hard and earthy, with black fruit aromas that are big but closed. The palate is short, stocky and blocky, with mammoth but basic flavors that turn rubbery. Not much of a finish to speak of.",Old Vines,83,15.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,El Curato
105666,Germany,"Aromas are redolent of a candy store—cotton candy, watermelon sours and candied apples. The palate is a sharp contrast, dry, austere and a bit thin. A few years in the cellar will help tame the piercing acidity.",Trabener Würzgarten Kabinett,83,19.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Max Wagner

105668,Hungary,"The often underrated Kefrankos grape performs well here, with toffee and coffee ground character interwoven with fresh strawberries.

105669,US,"Oak sticks out, dominating with smoky caramel and vanilla toast aromas, and things are pretty much the same in the mouth.

105671,Spain,"Disappointing given Telmo Rodriguez's overall track record. Dehesa Gago 2008 is jumpy, sweaty and stemmy smelling, with weedy, burnt, acrid flavors.

105673,Australia,"This Shiraz blend lacks the jammy aromas of many of its brethren, offering instead white pepper and brambly red fruit.

Drink up.",Peace Family Vineyard Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon-Grenache-Mataro,83,10.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Red Blend,Andrew Peace
105674,Spain,"Fairly green, a bit oxidized and old smelling. The palate is short and choppy, with hard leftover tannins and dry, herbal fruit flavors that push up against vegetal.

105675,Germany,"Light and pretty on the nose, with carnations, lemon and just a hint of candied ginger in the background. A tad watery in the mouth, with a short citrus peel aftertaste. Drink up.",Trocken,83,16.0,Franken,,,Silvaner,Castell-Castell
105676,Spain,"Briary, herbal aromas bring hints of tomato sauce and burnt leaves to the game, while the palate is fairly innocuous in feel.

105679,Spain,"Leafy, dry and mature, with baked fruit and aromas of dried oregano and basil flakes.

105680,Spain,"Banana and green herb aromas make for a challenging nose. The palate has verve and acidity but its flavors of dull white fruits, melon and peach are jumbled.

105693,Chile,"At first it almost smells too Port-like, but then peppery spice enters the picture and it takes off.

It's slowly picking up bottle character, with the primary fruit flavors of blackberries and cherries mellowing as it picks up olive and earth notes.

105716,US,"The chilly 2011 vintage was kind to Dutton-Goldfield's whites, including this racy, clean offering. This is bone dry and modest in alcohol, with bracing acidity.

105718,US,"Dry and briskly acidic, this is rich in cherry, mocha and spice flavors that are just starting to turn the corner and develop aged bottle notes.

105720,Chile,"Bold, rubbery, lively Cabernet, with plenty of color, tannin and body. The palate is a bit angular and sheering, with snappy red-fruit flavors that rank as good but generic.

105722,Chile,"Out of the chute it lays low in the glass, with heavier blueberry and jammy black-fruit aromas. The palate is full, tannic and medicinal, with chocolate mint notes and some raisin.

105727,Chile,"Fairly earthy and a little bit herbal on the nose, with aromas of tomatillo, oregano and light fruit that almost amount to a nice salsa fresca.

105729,France,"Emphasizing the stalkiness of Cabernet Franc, with some smoky flavors and tight, dry tannins, this wine needs a few more months to bring out the berry fruits underneath. The balance, though, is potentially good, with fine fresh acidity.",,86,16.0,Loire Valley,Chinon,,Cabernet Franc,Remy-Pannier

105733,US,"This is a regional wine, but don't dismiss it because it doesn't have a vineyard designation.

105734,Italy,"This is a simple red wine from the Mediterranean island of Sardinia that delivers ripe aromas of mature blackberry, prunes, plums and candied fruit.

105735,Chile,"Early rubbery aromas give way to purer black-fruit notes. The mouth is generous and shows good feel and structure, while the flavors of blueberry and blackberry are simple to like, modestly sweet and generally quite ripe.

105740,South Africa,"Aromas of clove and spice start this assertive, easydrinking blend of Syrah and Viognier. Forward blackberry and cassis flavors mingle with oaky spice and sturdy tannins.

105742,Chile,"Slightly dusty and fresh smelling, with cherry/berry aromas that should ring familiar. The palate is zesty, tight, crisp and driving, although the fruit is anything but gigantic or exciting.

105745,Chile,"Olive and herb aromas carry the bouquet, while the body and mouthfeel are big, bulky, a touch unfocused but definitely not miserly or wanting for power. Tomato and oregano are prominent flavors, and the tannins start to build right from the start. Solid as a block, but herbal like an old-school Chilean Merlot.",Armador,85,13.0,Maipo Valley,,,Merlot,Odfjell
105746,Chile,"A just-the-facts, bare-bones kind of Cabernet that delivers just enough fruit, balance and finish to make it fully worthwhile as a value special. The nose is complete but not complex, and that's pretty much the formula here. Flavors of red cherry and raspberry are simple but nice, and the finish is fresh and manageable.",Selected Terroir,85,10.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Ema
105747,Italy,"There's a pungent note here of overripe fruit or mature strawberry that takes away from the overall harmony and elegance of the wine.

105749,Chile,"A little funky and sweaty, but definitely a live-wire white with tons of lime, kiwi, citrus and grapefruit flavors.

Not run-of-the-mill; it's a bit wild and out there.",Secreto,85,14.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Viu Manent
105750,Italy,"This is an excellent vintage, with delicate licorice shadings laced over blackberry, coffee, chocolate and root beer. It's intense and concentrated with some animal- or meat-like aromas that are within acceptable limits.",San Martino,89,40.0,Tuscany,Bolgheri Superiore,,Red Blend,Cipriana
105751,US,"This wine seems a bit stretched—it has been pushed to its limits, and perhaps beyond. The flavors are complex, and dance up against the borders of over-ripeness, with prune, smoke, balsamic, tar and earth all in evidence. Right now this is a fascinating bottle, but it may or may not age.",Reserve Series Spirithouse,89,72.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Argyle
105752,Germany,"The Gunderloch wines are among the best from Rheinhessen, even their non-site-specific wines like the Diva spätlese.

It's not the most complex game in town, and maybe it's on its way to having seen better days even if 2005 was a benchmark vintage.

106041,Chile,"A touch stemmy on the nose along with hints of compost, leather and animal. But in the mouth, it rings true as Pinot Noir.

106044,Chile,"Not a demanding wine at all as it opens with simple plum and berry aromas accented by an herbal hint.

106051,Spain,"You wouldn't call this wine “clean and polished.” It has some old country brett along with fig, earth, mushroom and liqueur on the nose. That said, it's dishing up heavy servings of chocolate and baked berry pie flavors. A big, bulky wine that's already losing clarity.

106129,US,"The term Claret is used properly here, to represent a classic Bordeaux blend, in this instance including all five grapes in generous proportions. It's a sensational value, with the depth, detail and precision of a much more expensive wine. Spicy red fruits, wisps of herb and black olive, a hint of earth and tar, all tease and tantalize, without overpowering the wine's innate finesse.",Claret Red Wine,90,20.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Robert Karl
106130,Austria,"A balanced blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay gives a rich wine, with mineral, pear and layered wood flavors. There is some herbaceousness, but the wood and creamy Chardonnay give broadness and richness.",Impérial,90,35.0,Burgenland,,,Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay,Schloss Halbturn
106131,Germany,"Impressive for its minerality, this wine offers up aromas of petrol, honey and slate rather than the fruit-driven notes of many Rieslings. In the mouth, it's like drinking liquid rocks with just enough honey to help the minerals slide down smoothly, lingering sweetly on the finish.",Johannisberger Erntebringer Kabinett,90,19.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Schumann-Nägler
106132,Germany,"In really warm years like 2006, wines from the cool Saar valley often excel. This offering shows crisp, refreshing acidity to balance its residual sugar and classic flavors of green apple, lime and pineapple. Under it all is a firm foundation of slate-driven minerality and a fine, linear structure.",Ockfener Bockstein Spätlese,90,24.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Dr. Fischer
106133,Germany,"In a departure from Mosel stereotypes, this wine is missing the floral fragrance and vivacity so typical of the region. But it remains impressive, offering plenty of concentration and density, hugely mineral aromas and flavors that call to mind molten rocks and even an oily texture and viscous finish. How it will age is impossible to predict, so drink it over the next 2–3 years.",Brauneberger Juffer-Sonnenuhr Spätlese,90,29.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef)
106134,Austria,"An unfinished masterpiece, still dominated by youthful yeasty flavors, ripe with white peaches, pears and a crisp pink grapefruit element. The wine has minerality, but the juiciness is still to happen. Three to 4 years at least.",Gaisberg Riesling,90,46.0,Kamptal,,,Riesling,Hirsch
106135,Austria,"Taking their cue from the old name for the local vineyards around Deutschkreutz in Mittelburgenland, the Reisners, who run the Igler winery, have fashioned a traditional style of Blaufränkisch. It's impressive, the density of the tannins never overwhelming the ripe, juicy, black fruit flavors. It is certainly a ripe wine, but the richness never overpowers the structure and the acidity.",Biiri Reserve,90,34.0,Mittelburgenland,,,Blaufränkisch,Hans Igler
106136,Australia,"A good value in a more savory Shiraz, Juniper Crossing's 2005 features meaty, peppery—even mushroomy—aromas, while flavors of blackberry and black olive build to a spicy crescendo on the finish.

106137,Australia,"A strong effort for this Penfolds bottling, the 2004 Bin 128 features powerful aromas of chocolate and cassis, then follows up with slightly more nuanced flavors that add brighter berry notes to the mix. Tannins are silky-smooth, suggesting early drinkability, although it should age well until at least 2015.",Bin 128,90,23.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,,Shiraz,Penfolds
106138,US,"The '06 displays bright and crisp flavors of currant and cherry. Tannins are substantial, with a satisfying earthy streak underscoring notes of graphite and olive.

106142,Chile,"Like the winery's 2010 Corralillo Syrah, this comes across funky, more herbal and pointed than in prior years. The body is full but hard, with roasted berry, spice and herb flavors.

106148,Chile,"Although this wine has the darkness, density and body of a higher-level wine, it smells baked and balsamic, with an earthy flatness to the nose.

106152,Hungary,"Hints of baking spice, smoke and black coffee add kick to the sweet black-plum and cherry flavors on this full-bodied red blend.

It's devastatingly good, but also too young and fresh now to show its best. With its fine tannins and exquisite balance, this articulate young wine should be best after 2013.",The Narrows Vineyard,96,75.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Goldeneye
106227,Germany,"From a vintage not known for its supersweet selections, this wine is a revelation. Honey and bergamot notes mingle easily on the nose, while the palate unfolds to reveal layers of honey, dried apricots and orange marmalade. It's rich, viscous and concentrated without any heaviness, with a finish that's sweet and lingering. This should age through 2040 easily.",Leiwener Laurentiuslay Beerenauslese,96,175.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,St. Urbans-Hof
106228,France,"With only 795 bottles produced, this is a special treat. Although it's ready to drink now, it has the structure and pedigree to age for decades. Loaded with rich nut and rancio flavors, there's so much going on; aromas of dried orange peel, gingerbread, toasted macadamia nut and a drizzle of molasses lead into flavors of dried red plum and fig dusted with Nutella powder and soft white pepper. Complex, spicy and full, with an endless finish.",Legend Vintage,96,380.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Maury,,Red Blend,Gérard Bertrand
106229,US,"This dramatic, compulsively good Cabernet is the first Howell Mountain Cab ever from the winery. It's enormous and gigantic in volume, with blackberry and cherry pie filling, cassis and oak flavors that scream, yet the tannins are tight, and the wine is so dry, the rich fruit is cloaked in a veil of control. Really defines an important new step for this veteran winery. Drink now–2020.",Limited Release,96,120.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Charles Krug
106230,Spain,"Very strange from the start. Odd stuff, with a candied, spice-like set of aromas that go straight to sweet, dull gumdrop flavors. Feels o.k. on the palate but tastes and smells weird.",Reserva Brut,82,20.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Font I Jordana
106231,Lebanon,"There's an initial struck match note that floats away to reveal nice mixed berry and char notes, propped up by a sinewy tannins. Full bodied and rich, with a final note of plum jam. Try with barbecue. Drink now.",,82,12.0,Bekaa Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Heritage

106234,US,"This Claret combines Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc into a sturdy, tannic, slightly sweaty wine with only the barest hints of black fruits.

106235,Uruguay,"Judging by this example, Uruguay might have some potential for the notoriously difficult Pinot Noir grape. There's a good helping of rusticity here, but also some nice cherry fruit and an appealing earthiness. Drink up.",Reserva,82,20.0,Uruguay,,,Pinot Noir,Bodegas Carrau
106236,Spain,"Simple to the point of being boring. Aromas of generic white fruits don't stand out, while the palate is soft and tastes vaguely of kiwi and nectarine. Finishes flat. Similar to the 2007.",,82,13.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Xarel-lo,Sumarroca

106246,Spain,"Quite dilute, with gaseous, chemical aromas that subside with time but never really leave.

106254,Uruguay,"Straightforward and honest with aromas of Fernet Branca and bing cherries in a medium-bodied frame. Short, tannic finish.

106263,Spain,"Baked apple and spice aromas form a recognizable bouquet, while the palate oozes with grapefruit and tart apple flavors. This is zesty, clean, a little bit lean and fresh.

Imported by Freixenet USA.",Brut Reserva,86,10.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas

106266,Spain,"Fits the mold of traditional Rioja Crianza. The nose has oaky warmth and a slight mulchy quality that probably comes from the hot vintage.

106270,Spain,"Light citrus and a hint of baby powder is about all you get from the neutral nose.

106273,Spain,"From a hot year, this wine adheres to tradition. It's 85% Tempranillo with Mazuelo and Graciano, so it's straight from central casting.

106274,Portugal,"With its proportion of barrel-aged Trincadeira, this special selection has some pretensions, which are generally fulfilled.

106296,US,"Made in the classic Clos du Val style, this Cabernet is less ripe, drier and more acidic than many of its Napa Valley neighbors. It's also very tannic.

Shows the massively ripe character of the vintage, with a starburst of raspberries, cherries, cola, minerals and spices, while the acidity and tannins are just about perfect.

106505,US,"One sip is all it takes to understand that this is a vital, impressive and possibly profound wine. A blend of 96% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc, it displays the voluptuous richness of a Heidi Barrett wine, but also shows a firmness of character and a structural dryness that elevate it. Exceptionally flavorful in blackberries and cherries, it has tantalizing hints of herbs, olive tapenade and, of course, intensely fine oak.

106506,US,"An extraordinary Chardonnay whose complicated richness is balanced with tight acidity and a firm grounding of stony minerals.

Only 97 cases were produced.",Precioso,95,75.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller Estate
106507,Germany,"Hugely sweet and decadent, this is a tour de force of botrytized winemaking.

106510,US,"This is a huge, velvety, dramatic Syrah. With stunning tannins and depth of fruit, it represents the best of Howell Mountain red from a great vintage.

Really great now, and should develop in the bottle over the next six years.",,94,70.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Syrah,Arkenstone
106511,US,"A great success for this bottling. With extraordinarily high residual sugar, the wine is very sweet in wild honey, infused with the essence of oranges and apricots, folded into rich, buttery custard, and sprinkled with vanilla sugar and cinnamon. It's all balanced with a squirt of lime acid. If that sounds good, it is.

106512,US,"This is a Pinot Noir meant to be aged. No question about it, from the citrusy acids to the sandy tannins to the somewhat awkward primary fruit flavors that desperately want to resolve with the oak. Packed with raspberries and cherries, the wine is completely dry and firm in minerals, and seems easily able to age for at least six years. Only 120 cases were produced.",Quarter Moon Vineyard,94,100.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
106513,France,"There's a strong mineral backbone to this wine, which alongside notes of garrigue (think lavender and bay leaves) and purple violet florals highlight this fantastic terroir. Black cherry, plum, licorice stick and black peppercorns flood the palate, while hints of used coffee grinds, cocoa powder and graham cracker crust appear on the seriously long finish. Creamy and decadent but balanced; easy to drink now but will age gracefully.",La Forge,94,75.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Corbières-Boutenac,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Gérard Bertrand
106514,US,"A dry wine, companion to the winery's off-dry estate bottling. This does not give up its fruit as some dry Rieslings do; there is a pleasing mix of lemon, grapefruit, pineapple and apricot, full in the mid-palate, then turning more astringent and cheerily tart in the finish.

Delicious.",Laguna West,93,39.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fog Crest
106522,US,"The best thing about this Chardonnay is the acidity. It's brisk and clean, and gives a zesty finish to the extraordinarily rich pineapple, papaya, lime and Meyer lemon flavors that are almost sweet, but aren't.

Yields are extraordinarily low, as they are in these coastal ancient vineyards. The wine's concentration is impressive, spanning ripe, crushed raspberries through cherry pie filling to black currants, with all sorts of earthy, minerally, balsam and cedar complexities, not to mention the masses of spice.

106638,Chile,"A sweeter, richer, more confected wine, with aromas of buttered toast, butterscotch and apricots. The body is full but not what you'd call flabby; there's adequate acidity to cut the chunkiness.

106655,Spain,"Consistency is apparently not Fransola's calling card. One year it's pungent and green, and then in a warm year like 2006 it's fruity, ripe and sweet, with green apple, pear and tropical fruit flavors making their mark.

106844,US,"Don't even think of opening this Cab now. The tannins are hard, and they lock down the considerable blackberry, black currant, anise and dark chocolate flavors. It's a very fine wine. The 100% Cab grapes come from Howell Mountain, Atlas Peak, Mt. Veeder, Rutherford, St. Helena and Coombsville, making this a sort of international citizen of Napa Valley. 2011–2016.",,92,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Neal Family
106845,US,"The most massive, dense and ageworthy of all the Sparkman reds, this Kingpin Cabernet is a barrel selection of the darkest, deepest wines in the cellar. Almost pure cassis fruit is matched to a firm, steely spine. Tannins are strong but not heavy, and the aging in two thirds new wood has not turned the wine terribly oaky. Hints of rock, tobacco and earth promise more flavor development over the next decade.",Kingpin,92,56.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sparkman
106846,US,"This is the most citrusy of Testarossa's '07 Chards, brimming with Meyer lemon, lime and pineapple flavors. Smooth, smoky oak and lees add complex layers of butter, cream and tart yeastiness. Brilliant but immature, the wine should come into its own after 2009.",Bien Nacido,92,39.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Testarossa
106847,US,"Pure varietal, this captures the house style perfectly, with a ripe blend of brambly berries set against crisp natural acids. Almond candy and chocolate graham cracker flavors appear, reflecting 28 months in 75% new oak barrels. The transition to the silky finish brings a refreshing minerality.",,92,30.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Karl
106848,US,"A lovely Cabernet Franc, one of the best on the market. Shows classic Pride Mountain characteristics of ripeness, balance and immediate drinkability, although it will take a few years in the cellar. Dry and full-bodied, it's rich in black cherries, spices and oak, with firm tannins. Now–2013.",,92,60.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Pride Mountain
106849,Argentina,"Very impressive for a blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot. Starts with a rich, bacony nose that brings cassis and blackberry, while the palate is saturated, big and layered, with wild raspberry, chocolate and spice flavors. It touches all the bases while maintaining a rich, almost syrupy mouthfeel. Drink now through 2014.",Gran Corte VII,92,44.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Pulenta Estate
106850,Argentina,"Excellent value in top-flight Malbec. In the four years that we've rated this wine, it hasn't dropped below 90 points. This vintage, with its deep, smooth luscious nose and dark black fruit flavors mixed with spice and chocolate, is the best Piedra Negra to date. A pure, delicious Malbec to drink now and over the next four years.",Piedra Negra,92,22.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,François Lurton
106851,US,"An outstanding value, this Walla Walla Valley Cab is awash in black fruits and black flavors—toast, coffee, smoke, licorice, graphite, and black olive. Tannins are silky and the length suggests a wine that will age gracefully.",,92,26.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dusted Valley
106852,US,"Notable for richness and depth of flavor, the hallmarks of a well-grown and well-made wine.

Very fine now, but young, and should develop bottle complexity through 2012.",,92,38.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clos Pegase
106853,US,"This new Uriah is 60% Merlot, 28% Cabernet Franc, 6% Petit Verdot and 6% Malbec—all estate-grown. It offers more complexity and detail than the rest of the Spring Valley line-up, and carries its almost 15% alcohol well. Whiffs of wood smoke, tobacco, and marzipan lead into a lovely mix of red fruits, spices and barrel flavors. It's just a bit hot in the finish; and the tannins seem attenuated, but that may be due to its youth. A fine bottle.",Uriah Red Wine,92,50.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Spring Valley Vineyard
106854,US,"Native yeast, weekly batinage (lees stirring) in 50% new barrels, and, most importantly, a superb vineyard—Stillwater Creek—make for the best Chardonnay yet from Sparkman. Yeasty and young, dense and loaded with fresh pear, toasted nuts and butter, this is seductive and immensely enjoyable.",Lumière,92,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Sparkman
106855,US,"A successful Zinfandel that shows its Dry Creek origins in the classic Zinfandel flavors and structure.

106856,France,"A tremendously spicy wine with a complex nose that smells decadent. Notes of black cherry, blackberry and roasted espresso beans fill the nose and lead right through to the medium-weight mouth along with flavors of black plum skins and olive. The tannins are firmly structured among the crushed velvet texture, filling out the lush palate. Long and lingering on the finish; while delicious now, could also be held for a couple of years.",Le Pégourier,92,45.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Corbières,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Château de Sérame
106857,Argentina,"A purple monster with lovely aromatics of campfire, mint, blackberry and spice. Very deep in the mouth, but not overweight or even slightly out of balance. The flavors are robust and pure, with an emphasis on black fruit, cassis and chocolate. And the finish brings nuances of cardamom, nutmeg and peppercorn. By far Goulart's epic wine. Drink now through 2013.",Grand Vin de Goulart,92,60.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Bodega Goulart
106858,France,"Winemaker Pierre Jehan's interpretation of Corton-Charlemagne for Henri de Villamont is to retain great fruit, but not to produce a wine with too much weight. The advantage is rich wine, with spicy pear and ripe yellow fruits, but with a great bounce of acidity.",,92,102.0,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne,,Chardonnay,Henri de Villamont
106859,US,"Hard to believe this Sauvignon Blanc never saw oak, because it has a vanilla bean flavor that must come from the grapes alone, although lees aging surely contributes to the creaminess. The underlying flavors are complex, ranging from Meyer lemons and sweet limes to exotic tropical quince, kiwi and guava and just a touch of gooseberry. Best of all is the acidity, which brightens everything. A great Dry Creek Sauvignon Blanc.",,92,28.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Stephen & Walker
106860,US,"A Rhône-style blend of Mourvèdre, Syrah, Grenache and Zinfandel, this red shows classic Paso personality. It's soft and dry, with cherry-berry flavors that taste a little stewed. The dash of Zin really adds a punch of spice.",Moonraker,85,23.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,10 Knots
106861,Portugal,"A soft, full, creamy wine, with light acidity and a touch of green structure. The white version of one of Portugal's most famous brands, this has fresh flavors of peas, green fruits.",Marquès de Borba,85,,Alentejo,,,Portuguese White,J. Portugal Ramos
106862,Italy,"Vietti's 2006 Moscato has a lovely if slightly muted nose of white peaches and green plum. On the palate, the lack of concentration shows; it is pleasant and quite complex, but the flavors are a little wispy.",,85,15.0,Piedmont,Moscato d'Asti,,Moscato,Cascinetta Vietti
106863,Spain,"Jané Ventura is known for its sparkling cavas, but this table wine from Xarello, Muscat and the obscure Subirat Parent grape is appealing because it doesn't bite off more than it can chew. There's no oak so what you get is lean, tranparent lemon and lime flavors and a ready mouthfeel. Interesting but not for everyone.",,85,11.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,White Blend,Jané Ventura
106864,US,"From Carneros, this wine has tangy acidity that balances the sugariness of the tropical fruit and fig flavors. Lots of oak, too, but the wine should be drier.",Estate,85,30.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Hartwell
106865,US,"This is not really a dry wine, but it is a very nice one because the acids and tannins make it balanced. The flavors are of mashed ripe cherries and raspberries, sprinkled with cinnamon and powdered cocoa.",Old Vine,85,16.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Zinfandel,Klinker Brick
106866,Italy,There's less aromatic intensity here although you can catch whiffs of sweet fruit and peach. It does have body and length and a firmly tonic feel in the mouth. Pair with informal picking foods.,Cuvée Extra Dry,85,13.0,Veneto,Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene,,Prosecco,La Marca
106867,US,"If only this wine had greater structure, it would earn a higher score, but as it is, it's too soft and sugary, which makes it taste like the filling of a pie or tart. Raspberries, cherries and figs are the flavors, with the smoke and caramel of oak. Drink now.",Jensen Vineyard,85,60.0,California,Mount Harlan,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Calera
106868,Spain,"This vintage seems lighter on its feet than previous versions, but it's still a strange, atypical wine made from Garnacha Blanca and other Priorato white varieties. The bouquet is heavy and dusty, while the palate is thick and woody, with white pepper, peach and melon notes. Pithy bitterness weighs down the finish. Unusual but stirs interest.",Blanc de Montsalvat,85,45.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,White Blend,Francesc Sanchez Bas

106870,Italy,"This has everything going for it: good intensity, variety of aromas and fresh acidity. It would have scored higher, only it seems to lack that tonic, bubbly edge of other Prosecco—maybe because 15% of other grapes are used. Aromas include lemon zest, sweet basil, peach and white stone.",Uvaggio Storico Val d'Oca Extra Dry,85,,Veneto,Prosecco,,Prosecco,Cantina Produttori di Valdobbiadene
106871,Italy,Frizzante Proseccos are made with less atmospheric pressure and therefore taste extremely smooth and silky in the mouth.

106872,South Africa,"Gamy spice, cigar and tobacco notes make this a classic choice. It also has a touch of alkaline smoke—an indigenous spin that will attract or dissuade, depending on a person's palate. Overall, the wine has a facet of eccentric appeal, making it a poised choice for the cellar.",,85,41.0,Stellenbosch,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Thelema

106874,Spain,"Smooth, savory and spicy, but with enough red-fruit character to ensure that it doesn't taste dull.

106878,South Africa,"Subtle scents and flavors of dark berry, cedar and spice make this Pinotage both embraceable and friendly, though it's still full of the distinctive Pinotage smoke and rubber that tend to divide drinkers when it comes to this grape. The wine has ample body and structure and will age nicely.",,84,15.0,Coastal Region,,,Pinotage,Fairview
106879,Spain,"This seems to be an attempt to mock the Moscato d'Asti style from Italy, but it doesn't quite pull it off.

106881,Spain,"Nothing to swoon over but much better than the label's unpalatable 2005 and '06 wines.

Not a bad midlevel wine if you catch it on a good day.",Sombrero Rojo Crianza,84,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Barriosa
106882,Spain,"Opens with spice notes of cinnamon and anise before transitioning to fuller cherry and plum flavors.

106886,US,"Made in an exotic style, almost bizarre, with cherry-pie filling, candied ginger, red licorice and chocolate mint flavors that are not really Cabernet-like.

106888,US,"The opening scent of funky, sweaty leather is not promising, and indeed, it tastes overly soft and muted. You can sense some good fruit in there, but it's tamped down. The tannins stick out, making the wine awkward and common.",,84,65.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Miner
106889,US,"The underlying wine here is so good in fruity flavor and zesty acidity, you have to wonder why the winery piled so much new oak on top. The Chard is dominated by caramel, vanilla cream and butterscotch.",,84,16.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,York Mountain Winery

106897,US,"The grapes got a little too ripe, getting away from the winemaker's control.

106898,Spain,"Blackberry and bramble work the nose, with a medium-bodied, generously oaked palate to follow.

106910,Spain,"Freshness is in demand as the nose shows dampness, tobacco and wood more than bright fruit. In the mouth, there's oak-driven flavors of vanilla and tobacco accenting basic red fruit.

106930,Chile,"A little gritty and meaty on the nose, with vegetal notes of celery and beans sneaking onto the bouquet.

Reflective of the variety on one hand but generic on the other.",Reserva,84,13.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Carmenère,Ventisquero
106931,Chile,"A bit sweet, confected and fluffy on the nose, especially for Syrah. And it's definitely on the heavy side as the flavors lean toward raisin and prune and stewed plum.

106941,US,"This Syrah, as in 2006, is the best of the Airfield reds, opening with varietal scents and showing some gamy, herbal, minty notes.

106943,Chile,"Plenty of oak off the bat, which is what deviates this wine from the brand's standard $8 Cab.

107021,Austria,"True to its varietal character, this is earthy, on the rustic, farmyard side, but balanced with concentrated licorice and fresh black berries. There is a serious core of dusty tannins, but the other flavors dominate a wine that can be drunk now.",Alte Reben,89,60.0,Burgenland,,,St. Laurent,Pittnauer
107022,US,"This is spicy and varietally specific, with sharp, tight, bright red berry flavors and a peppery finish. Made in a forward, fruit-powered style, it should be enjoyed while the youthful exuberance is there in full bloom. In   the very back of the finish are hints of smoked meat.",,89,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Tamarack Cellars
107023,US,"Rich and 100% barrel fermented, this delicious Chardonnay is thick and luscious, with buttered nuts, pineapple and candied citrus; a really concentrated wine with exceptional depth and density for the price. The oak is present and accounted for, but not at all intrusive; it's really a generously fruity wine with a big mid-palate. Outstanding value.",,89,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Tamarack Cellars
107024,Italy,"Here's a sweet, candy-smelling Prosecco Cartizze with notes of exotic fruit, mango, papaya and lime. Those Caribbean aromas help this wine stand apart from the rest and underline its fun, frothy and sweet appeal.",,89,25.0,Veneto,Prosecco Superiore di Cartizze,,Prosecco,Villa Sandi
107025,Australia,"Full-bodied and firm, this dark-fruited Shiraz an be consumed now with rare beef or lamb, or cellared 2–3 years. Cola and blackberry fruit dominate, with notes of chocolate and cedar chiming in on the finish.",,89,17.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Shiraz,Wildberry Estate
107026,US,"Purple/black and compact, this wine needs plenty of breathing time to reveal its layers. Klipsun vineyard fruit brings power and tannic muscle. The aromas are intriguing; a bit overripe and raisiny, but also offering truffle, smoked meat and burnt toast.",,89,37.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Page Cellars
107027,Germany,"Light in weight despite 9.5% alcohol, this is a refreshingly off-dry Riesling with a mouthwatering finish. Green apple, lime and mineral notes round out the typical flavor profile.",Kabinett,89,20.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Schloss Vollrads
107028,Argentina,"Earthy, deep and true to its Uco Valley roots; this is a very good and fairly serious Malbec that doesn't try to overstep its natural limitations. It's not too extracted or oaky but instead delivers robust blackberry, plum and caramel flavors backed by a warm, mildly oaky finish with menthol and mocha. Drink now into 2010.",Reserve,89,20.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Salentein
107029,Spain,"A slightly heavier version of Verdejo, especially given 2007's cool conditions in Rueda. The wine has waxy peach and papaya aromas follwed by apricot, pineapple and mango flavors. It definitely opens on the palate and then finishes with a fleshy texture, additional fruit and even some nuts. Good complexity yet still a forward type of white wine.",Fuente Elivra,89,14.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Pedro Escudero
107030,Italy,"Bandarossa delivers prickly fizz and direct aromas of stone fruit, pear and Golden Delicious apple.

107031,Spain,"Dry, smoky and showing a touch of leather, this is a smooth crianza with bright berry flavors, a bit of heft, and well-applied oak that doesn't overwhelm. Black cherry and raspberry flavors are bright, and the vanilla and butter elements are controlled and should subside in due time. Drink now into 2010.",Viña Real Plata Crianza,89,21.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
107032,Austria,"Super-rich, this is an atypical wine, spice rather than fruit dominating. So enjoy the cinnamon, vanilla and cream flavors—the acidity is a minor element. The finish has exotic, spice-laden character. Screwcap.",Gaisberg Riesling,89,46.0,Kamptal,,,Riesling,Hirsch
107033,France,"Very fresh, very raspberry, this wine opens gently with sweetness and roundness. The tannins do come into play, but ever so gently, a counterpoint to the sweet, fine fruits that dominate this attractive, relatively early drinking wine.",Les Chouacheux Premier Cru,89,40.0,Burgundy,Beaune,,Pinot Noir,Louis Jadot
107034,France,"From its own estate, this Louis Latour wine is a ripe, strawberry- and juicy plum-flavored wine, sustained by a well- judged dry layer of tannins. It is sweet, the acidity showing through in the red fruits.",Domaine Latour,89,50.0,Burgundy,Aloxe-Corton,,Pinot Noir,Louis Latour
107035,US,"A nice Pinot, showing real complexity. Dry and medium-bodied, the wine's acidity is brisk, and highlights flavors of cherries, red currants, pomegranates, cola, Chinese five-spice and Provençal herbs. Might develop for a few years, although it's hard to predict, since it's a new brand.",Le Bon Climat Vineyard,89,45.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,La Fenêtre
107036,Greece,"A trio of elegant whites comprises this blend from the island of Santorini, and each lends a unique facet that is authentically Greek. On the nose, clean, friendly citrus flavors reign, with an appealing touch of sweet fruit, minerals and spice adding dimension. On the palate, the wine offers fresh but rounded flavors that linger  but leave it refreshed. Overall, an intriguing, food-friendly sip.",,89,13.0,Santorini,,,White Blend,Hatziyiannis
107037,US,"This is a dark, sappy, saturated wine, and the power and grip of the fruit belies its claim of 12.9% alcohol. The Malbec is plenty ripe without being over-ripe, and the fruit retains a certain muscularity, along with a mélange of cherries, plums, rum-soaked raisins and coffee liqueur. Thoroughly delicious and captivating.",Alice Vineyard,89,30.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Malbec,Tagaris
107038,Austria,"A rich, cherry- and black fig-flavored wine, layered with smokiness, some wood and a dry, firm core of tannins. There is a juicy quality from the blend's Blaufränkisch, while Cabernet Sauvignon lends the tannins. Aging over 3–4 years.",Impérial,89,50.0,Burgenland,,,Red Blend,Schloss Halbturn

107040,Argentina,"Full, chewy, doughy, spicy and intensely fruity. This single-vineyard Malbec offers a little bit of everything, and all in balanced, measured doses. The cherry and blackberry fruit is bold but pure, while chocolate comes in to darken things up. A textbook steak and potatoes wine with a bit of complexity, but mostly it's about easygoing fun.",Single Vineyard D.O.C,92,22.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Luigi Bosca
107041,Italy,"Run by the Castellani family, this is a promising estate and one consumers should keep an eye on. This vineyard-designate cru strikes all the right chords: It's traditional and clearly territory-driven, yet it remains lush, generous and pleasing thanks to 32 months in oak casks and native yeasts. Chocolate, spice, black pepper, almond, earth, ginger, apple and wild herbs characterize a complex wine with velvety texture.",Vigneti di Ravazzól,92,70.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Cà La Bionda
107042,Germany,"An affordable BA, presumably from a variety of vineyard sites, this is relatively light in body, but it's still a sweet little wine. Fresh apple and citrus aromas and flavors fold in touches of cinnamon, finishing clean and fresh. The bright acidity suggests this may work best as a foil for foie gras or cheeses rather than as a true dessert wine.",Beerenauslese,92,55.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Dr. Loosen
107043,Austria,"The 600-foot Schützner Stein broods over the Neusiedlersee, a great place to grow Blaufränkisch. Blended with Merlot, this is impressive, a powerhouse of dense tannins and black fruit. The acidity shows through, but the wine is as much about extreme concentration. It needs aging, over 5 years and more.",Schützner Stein,92,52.0,Burgenland,,,Red Blend,Prieler
107044,Germany,"Crisp and clean, with a long, delicately wrought finish, this is a throwback to the auslesen of earlier times, without heaps of sweetness, but instead playing off the fine balance between sugar and acid. Floral and citrus aromas weave around a core of green apple fruit, while a bass line of slatey minerality underscores the melody.",Brauneberger Juffer Auslese,92,24.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Willi Haag
107045,Italy,"Cecilia Beretta is the top line of the Pasqua estate and this wine delivers the heat and power you'd normally expect from Amarone. It also imparts expansive notes of maple syrup, earth, cassis berry and distinct peanut or cashew aromas. It's chunky and chewy in the mouth with good length. Pair with game meat or aged cheese.",Terre di Cariano,91,59.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Cecilia Beretta
107046,US,"Our favorite of the three J. Lohr cuvées is this one, based on Cabernet Franc. The variety's floral, herbal notes mark the aromas, then give way on the palate to broad, mouthfilling flavors of brandied cherries and baking spices. It's lush and soft in the style of the winery and the region, but retains a slightly greater sense of focus than the Cuvée Pom. Drink now–2012.",Cuvée St. E,91,56.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,J. Lohr
107047,US,"Opens with a burst of red cherry, plum and pomegranate aromas, and a smoky scent of charred meat bone that offers hints of bacon fat. Tastes beautifully ripe and supple, with complex fruit, spice and oak flavors that are supported by an intricate acid-tannin structure. A terrific wine, but I encountered some bottle variation in various tastings.",Redwoods' Edge,91,40.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Black Kite
107048,Italy,"La Giaretta is an up-and-coming winery in full evolution with a modern approach and excellent pricing. There are deep oak aromas here that thankfully do not overwhelm delicate notes of cherry cola, cough drop, Indian spice, herbal infusion and almond.

107049,Italy,"This historic estate on the shores of Lake Garda is one of Amarone's biggest ambassadors when it comes to foreign markets.

107050,Austria,"Velvet and smooth black fruits are on the surface of this Bordeaux blend. But underneath this softness is a dense, concentrated tannic wine, with wood flavors, dry layers and the power to age for several years. While this may not be a Burgenland blend, it has some of the herbal, spice character of the reds from this region.",,91,63.0,Burgenland,,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Ernst Triebaumer
107051,Germany,"Big and full-bodied, with just a touch of sugar in evidence, while the alcohol is up to 13%. Petrol and slate notes mark the nose, while the fruit features pineapple, nectarine and melon. Long, powerful and citrusy on the finish, with underlying minerality and spice that provides fascinating complexity. Great now, but there's no reason this shouldn't age well for five or more years.",Rüdesheim Berg Schlossberg QbA,91,55.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Georg Breuer
107052,Austria,"This is the Feilers' flagship red, a blend of Blaufränkisch, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, smooth, ripe and velvety. The tannins seem soft initially because of the new French wood flavors, but to finish, they become firm, dry and tough, promising some good aging. For now, enjoy the sweet blackberry fruits.",Solitaire,91,50.0,Burgenland,,,Red Blend,Feiler-Artinger
107053,France,"Aged in wood for 18 months, and made from old vines, this is a rich, botrytised wine, with wild flower honey, perfumed peaches and a deliciously piercing acidity.

107054,Italy,"This is a big, brawny, plush, “international” Amarone that sees 4 years of oak and delivers thick layers of espresso coffee, chocolate fudge, wood toast and honey nut. It has a chewy-viscous mouthfeel, rounded off by caressing spice flavors and very good length on the finish.",La Rosta,91,56.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Degani
107055,US,"The biggest of the winery's three '05s, this starts to approach Grenache in its voluptuousness and rich mouthfeel of cherries and cocoa.

107056,Argentina,"Since coming onto the scene with the 2002 vintage, this Chilean-run venture (Montes S.A.) has hit the right notes time after time.

Very modern, but done in the right way.",Ultra,91,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Kaiken
107057,US,"Dry and tannic compared to today's lush, over-the-top Napa style, this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend hearkens back to the old Inglenook and Martini Cabs, which were ready to drink on release, yet aged for a long time.

107059,Austria,"First created in 1992, this international blend is a fine contribution to Bordeaux-style wines around the world.

107060,France,"One of a range of three single-vineyard dry wines from Jo Pithon, this is the firmest, needing long aging as the Chenin develops its secondary flavors.

107061,US,"This is one of the best rosés in California.

107062,Austria,"With its 18 months wood aging, this is a velvety smooth wine, layering its fruits easily and with plenty of ripeness.

107063,Austria,"A blend of Zweigelt, Blaufränkisch and Merlot, this is Pittnauer's top wine, a smooth and ripe, with a brushed velvet texture. The surface softness only masks the power underneath.

107064,Italy,"The Recchia brothers, Riccardo and Roberto, are among the area's largest private owners. They sell fruit and juice but keep the best selections for their own production.

107067,Austria,"A big, wood-aged wine, which at this stage shows considerable flavors from the Burgundy barrel aging. But then there's the fruit—red berries, cherries and sweetness—merging into what will be a soft, velvet wine. Give it 2–3 years.",Grand Select,91,30.0,Vienna,,,Pinot Noir,Wieninger
107068,US,"You're going to be hearing a lot more about Pinots from Marin County, which is between Sonoma and San Francisco. It's cool-climate, as witnessed by the crunchy acidity that accompanies the cola, cherry and blackberry flavors of this three-vineyard wine. There's a lot of oak, but it works well.

It was partially aged in oak, on the lees, bringing a creamy, yeasty freshness to the citrus, tropical fruit and green grass flavors that are totally dry. Brisk acidity makes for a clean scour.

It's not terribly complex but it's fun and easy to like.",,84,10.0,Western Cape,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Blue Cove
107184,Spain,"Opens with scents of pine needle, citrus peel and punch-bowl generic fruit aromas, and it keeps those characteristics on the palate while adding olive and pickle notes. Has good size and texture supporting a mundane flavor profile.",Pintoresco,84,10.0,Central Spain,Extremadura,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Luis Gurpegui Muga
107185,South Africa,"Spicy berry aromas followed by smoke, tobacco spice and blackberry make this a good wine for pairing with hearty dishes or drinking on its own. A touch of acidity adds restraint and balance. Ample tannins mean it will age well, but it's good to drink now.",Organic,84,15.0,Robertson,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bon Cap

107187,US,"On the sugary, jammy side, this Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel blend offers forward cherry, raspberry, blackberry, blueberry and chocolate flavors, with some raisiny notes.

107189,US,"I think by “lust” they mean something like a decadent chocolate truffle with a gooey cherry liqueur filling. That's what this sweetish wine, which has 15.9% alcohol, tastes like. It is awfully tasty, but it's hard to imagine what you'd drink it with, except, well, a chocolate truffle.",Lust,84,49.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Zinfandel,Michael David
107190,US,"Nice and smooth, this Merlot is for early drinking. It's as plump as can be in cherries, cocoa, cola and tobacco, with soft acids and even softer tannins.",,85,23.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Simi
107191,South Africa,"With the lush nose of pineapple, melon and tropical fruit in this intriguing wine from Elgin's Thelema, you'd expect a wine that's sweet and slightly viscous in the mouth. This wine is actually bone-dry with a firm acidity; perhaps even a touch too tight for this reviewer, but its citric, clean flavors are pleasurable regardless. Try this with oysters or seafood salad and drink it young.",Sutherland,85,20.0,Elgin,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Thelema
107192,Spain,"A snappy, jumpy type of wine that delivers aromas of red fruit and spice, but there's something piercing about it, too. The palate is clean and tight, with lots of cranberry/raspberry flavors framed by citrusy notes. Best if you prefer a leaner, shorter, crisper type of red.",Crianza,85,20.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,San Gabriel
107193,US,"The winery says the grapes were “focused” in the Arroyo Seco, and while you'd expect something crisper, keep in mind the heat of the vintage. The wine is very soft and chocolaty, with blackberry jam and cola flavors, and the finish is a little sweet.",,85,22.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Syrah,San Simeon

107195,South Africa,"Lively citrus character with a balanced, elegant overall feel make this SB from Stellenbosch producer Le Bonheur a winner for those who want more complexity along with zesty lift. There's a flinty, grassy quality here, alongside richer tropical flavors that make it ideal with poultry and fresh summer dishes.",,85,14.0,Stellenbosch,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Le Bonheur
107196,Spain,"Black fruit and olive aromas vie for center stage on the nose, while in the mouth there's black cherry but not much nuance or background.

107197,Spain,"The muscularity and meatiness of the nose indicate ripeness, while the aromas veer toward drying oak and a bit of raisin. The palate is chunky and dark, with subdued berry flavors front and center. And the weight is up there, especially for a youngster that spent only four months in oak.",Cuatro Meses en Barrica,85,18.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Callejo
107198,US,"Nature seems to have condemned California Barbera to be a rustic, hard wine, at best and this is a prime example of the species. Black in color and very tannic, it shows ripe berry and coffee flavors accented with peppery spice. These wines live forever, without gaining much complexity, so best now through 2020.",,85,22.0,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Sierra Foothills,Barbera,Easton
107199,Spain,"Not sure why an '03 Joven would still be on the market, but since it is we'll review it. The bouquet deals cinnamon and rubber along with basic berry aromas, while the palate is tangy and racy as it pumps cherry and raspberry fruit. Full on the finish but modest in flavor and style. Still seems fresh and ready to go.",Joven,85,19.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Castillo de Urtau
107200,France,"A high proportion of Merlot in the blend makes this a soft, rounded wine. It is spoiled by rustic, animal flavors and by a streak of acidity to finish that is out of balance with the rest of the wine.",,85,,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Martinens
107201,South Africa,"Lively, bright aromas and clean flavors of citrus and tropical fruit make this a fun wine to sip on its own or pair with dishes like seafood or Chinese chicken salad. There's pineapple on the palate too, giving the wine a playful edge. It's not to be mulled upon—it's too lighthearted for such contemplation—but meant to be enjoyed on a hot summer day with some rays beating on your back. Good, clean finish.",,85,15.0,Hemel en Aarde,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Sumaridge
107202,Australia,"Fat and a bit oily in texture, this is neither as floral or expressive as Riesling can be, but it still makes for a goodd drop. Scents and flavors of peach, superripe apples and a touch of melon finish dry, with a slight hint of bitterness.",,85,14.0,Tasmania,Tasmania,,Riesling,Ninth Island
107203,Australia,"A bit angular and tart, but this is a suitable starter-type Chardonnay—crisp and clean, with a focus on citrus. There's kiwi, lemon, kumquat and tangerine flavors, finishing briskly.",dB Selection,84,9.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Chardonnay,De Bortoli
107204,US,"This is a 100% varietal that has been barrel fermented in French oak. It underwent full malolactic fermentation, which may explain the soft, buttery mouthfeel. The flavors are of apricots, peaches and honeysuckle, with a sugary finish.",,84,24.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Viognier,Domaine de la Terre Rouge
107205,US,"This is a grape no one really knows how to deal with, and the learning curve is steep. With the warm '04 vintage, the winery has achieved enormous ripeness. Cherries, cassis and milk chocolate star, but don't look for the balance of a South African Pinotage. This softly tannic wine retains the stubborn rusticity of the Sierra Foothills.",Grand Reserve,84,32.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Pinotage,French Hill
107206,US,"Nice, fairly elegant red wine, gently structured and dry, with a silky texture and bursting with the most intense cherry liqueur flavor. It's a bit of a fruit bomb, though, and could use greater complexity.",Premium Select,84,24.0,California,California,California Other,Grenache,French Hill
107207,Spain,"Plenty ripe, in fact it's on the edge of raisiny but not quite over the line. The palate runs surprisingly racy with a lot of acidity, yet the flavor profile is short and drying. Shows a flash or two but it's not a complete wine and not worth the high price tag.",Tinto Figuero 15,84,55.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,García Figuero
107208,South Africa,"Arresting aromas of orange peel and peach start this clean, fresh and minerally wine. A decidedly firm acidity keeps the wine crisp and refreshing, and its tropical flavors are appetizing, but it may be too austere and even on the lean side for palates that prefer a little more curve to their SB. Still, a delicious food wine and great for a hot day.",Unfiltered,84,16.0,Stellenbosch,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Fleur Du Cap
107209,US,"Classic Paso Cab, very soft, totally ripe and generous, with a plethora of blackberry, cherry and red plum flavors that are almost jammy. Yet the wine is dry, with some real elegance. For early drinking.",,84,10.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Grayson
107210,Spain,"Drier and lighter than this winery's Crianzas and reservas, Granate shows rubber and red-fruit aromas and then lean cherry flavors. It's rather chalky and grabby late, and by then some of the thrill is gone.",Granate,84,10.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fuentespina
107211,US,"A little salty and soft, but saved by blackberry, cherry, blueberry and mocha flavors. There's a rich texture and a nice coating of oak in this decent everyday Merlot",,84,14.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Merlot,Maddalena
107212,US,"This is a smooth, soft and rich Syrah, bursting with intensely ripe blackberry, cherry and cassis flavors that approach chocolate truffles. It's not showing much finesse or complexity, but it's dry. Be warned: The alcohol is a ridiculous 16.8%.",In-Circle Cellar Club Iris Estate,84,48.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,Rideau
107213,US,"This is an okay wine, dry and silky, but it's just too cooked or stewed. Even out on the coast, the vintage was brutally hot, and you can taste how those grapes shriveled into raisins. There should be better results in '05 and '06.",,84,29.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Peter Cellars

107215,Spain,"A very smoky, meaty, heavily oaked style of Ribera Del Duero, and one that never reaches a level where the fruit can escape the oak boundaries. Yes, the palate has berry flavors and snap, but there's also a ton of pepper, vanilla and burnt spices that keep it under wraps. And the bet here is that time will not make it better.",Prestigio,84,22.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Corona de Castilla

107221,Italy,"Here's a fresh and easy blend of Trebbiano, Chardonnay and Sauvignon (at an attractive low price) that offers clean, but not very intense, aromas of cut grass, field flowers and lemon. The wine renders a sweet, chewy sensation in the mouth with soft texture and a creamy finish.",Moma,84,11.0,Central Italy,Rubicone,,White Blend,Umberto Cesari
107222,Chile,"Fairly gritty and reduced at first, with aromas of grilled beef, leather and herbs. After some airing it rounds out to show flavors of raspberry and sweet red fruits, while the feel is chewy, full and candied.

107223,Chile,"Odfjell's new entry into the under-$10 category is Babor, and the wine has aromas of raspberry jam and a touch of bramble and vinegar.

Classic value wine in the sense that it delivers up to a point.",Babor,84,9.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Odfjell
107224,Chile,"Fairly warm and syrupy on the nose, with bits of earth, leather and baked plum. The palate is a touch underdeveloped and herbal in terms of flavor, but there's no shortage of size.

107227,Chile,"Falernia hails from the northerly Elqui Valley, and its wines are unconventional and frankly all over the map as far as baseline quality goes. This blend of Carmenère and Syrah is funky and baked, with soft, unctuous fruit and a cooked, herbal taste to it. Candy and raisin are part of the jumbled package, and there's heat on the finish.

107235,Chile,"Simple and sort of plastic in smell, taste and feel. Bubble gum and apple skin flavors infiltrate the palate, and the mouthfeel and finish are creamy, dry and seem to be flattening out.

107242,Chile,"Not many modern-day Carmenères are as overtly green and underdone as this, which is surprising given that it's from warm Colchagua and a good vintage.

107360,Italy,"Marinella Camerani's dedication to tradition (with organic and biodynamic farming principles) is legendary. Hers are delicate, sometimes difficult wines, yet they are always prized for authenticity.

107361,US,"Dark in color and full-bodied for a rosé, this dry wine is enormously concentrated in the ripest, sweetest red and black cherries.

107362,France,"Round, unctuous and honeyed but with dry botrytis, this is a dessert wine with great freshness. In the mouth, it feels smooth and rich, with supersweet pear jam. The aftertaste loses some of the freshness, but this is an impressive wine.",Les Varennes,90,,Loire Valley,Coteaux du Layon Saint Aubin,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine Cady
107363,Austria,"As with so many red wine producers in Thermenregion, Pinot Noir and its local derivatives (Blauer Burgunder and Blaufränkisch) do very well at Johann Reinisch's estate.

This is indeed a reserve-level wine (with 15% Cabernet and Syrah), and it's ripe, forward, powerful and mildly tannic. And there's lots of oak to offset the dark berry flavors. Finishes toasty and firm, with mocha.",Cruz Alta President's Reserve,90,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodegas Escorihuela
107365,US,"Here's a big, ripe, dry, complex, voluptuous Pinot that comes from a cool Monterey region better known for dry whites.

107366,Italy,"Here is a refreshing approach to Amarone only because this wine is not overextracted or concentrated.

107367,Italy,"You'll feel the heat in this sun-drenched Amarone that offers a chewy consistency and a pleasingly firm but smooth texture.

On top of those are coffee, bacon and cocoa.",,90,60.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Tommasi
107368,US,"Give this one some time to breathe, as it's a bit tight on opening. With a relatively modest 13.5% alcohol, it's not as ripe as some Napa Cabs, and it's also fairly tannic.

107375,US,"Terrific Pinot Noir—balanced, dry and complex, showing exuberantly delicious fruit.

107379,US,"With delicious texture and concentration, this Lake County blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre from the 3,000-foot-high Fore Family Vineyard is intensely good, a deep reddish-purple blueberry-tinged infusion of earth and clove spice with dry, tight tannins and even a little lavender that'll linger.

107380,US,"Made in a jammy, soft but enormously rich style, this Syrah is almost like Port, except that it's dry. You'll want to sip it slowly, over time, to let it shape-shift in the glass. It offers waves of cherry pie filling, blackberry marmalade and cassis flavors, touched with sweetly smoked oak. Calls for very rich and elaborate beef and lamb dishes.",Rim Rock,92,46.0,California,California,California Other,Syrah,Piedrasassi
107381,US,"The 2008 vintage was cool and resulted in lighter-bodied wines that also were lower in alcohol. That trend benefited wines like this lovely one from Regale.

107382,Argentina,"Full, dense and dark, with powerful berry aromas and hints of rubber and leather on the bouquet. The palate breathes complexity and style but also raw power, and the flavors of blackberry, fig paste and herbs are just lusty and rich enough to register as modern Mendoza.

107389,US,"This baby Cabernet plays tricks on the palate, showing appealing soft, delicious complexity, then retreating into a cloak of tannins, and then emerging again with sweet fruit and spice.

107449,US,"In a tasting of its 2004 Rutherford peers, this wine did not stand out particularly well. It smelled and tasted porty sweet, with charry oak and syrupy flavors of cherry and blackberry jam.",,84,65.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,John Robert Eppler
107450,Spain,"Dry and spicy on the nose, but also a little cooked smelling. The flavors of this 100% Pinot Noir, but the flavors seem confected as they conjure memories of cherry Coke. The finish is short and leaks flavor, and always does the wine seem a bit strained.",Brut Rosé,84,11.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Pinot Noir,Juvé y Camps
107451,US,"Made in an old-fashioned way, this is the kind of wine the immigrants probably drank. It's soft, fruity-raisiny and simple, with enough tannins and acids to combat tomato sauce and garlic.",,84,34.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Barbera,VJB
107452,US,"A little simple, but likeable for its complex array of berry-cherry fruit with leather, balsamic, coffee and mushroom nuances. Would benefit from a better structure, as it's on the soft side. Mainly Syrah, with Petite Sirah and Viognier.",The Triple Play,84,28.0,California,Yorkville Highlands,North Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,Wattle Creek
107453,Spain,"The bouquet seems nutty and salinic, and overall this extra dry (meaning fairly sweet) focuses on soft and sugary mango and melon flavors. It's not as lively as it needs to be to balance the sweetness, so ultimately the wine comes up a touch flat. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Aria Estate Extra Dry,84,12.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
107454,US,"You'll find plenty of the red cherry flavors that mark this variety, along with lots of smoky vanilla and caramel, from 70% new oak. That said, the structure is too soft and simple. The wine would benefit from greater acidity and tannins, the lack of which make it taste sweeter than it really is.",Hope Family Vineyard,84,42.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Grenache,Austin Hope

107457,US,"At 4-plus years, this Oakville Cab is still fairly tannic and hard, with a gritty astringency to the blackberry and oak flavors.

107458,US,"A blend of Zinfadel, Syrah and Viognier, this will appeal to those who like their reds full of fruit, soft and sweet. Tastes like a spicy mix of blackberry, raspberry, milk chocolate and mint jelly.",Harry's Patio Red,84,25.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Red Blend,Fralich
107459,South Africa,"Chamonix is known for its stylish touch and this offers all of the hallmarks of a good Cabernet—deep berry, menthol, layered smoke and spice—in an approachable style.

107460,Chile,"Firm and condensed, but with the potential to unfold over the next three years. Cassis, tobacco, eucaplytus and dry berry aromas are classy and convincing; the palate is firm and defined by powerful cherry and cassis. Fold in toast and spice on the finish and you have a serious Cabernet Sauvignon that defines good value.",Single Vineyard,91,21.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Errazuriz
107461,US,"The vintage was kind to Dashe's Zinfandels, and in the Louvau bottling, they've produced a balanced, classically structured Dry Creek Zinfandel.

107462,US,"Beautifully concentrated and textural, this Viognier mixes melon, white peach, nectarine and lemon fruit with pleasing minerality.

107463,Argentina,"Blackberry, ripe plum, mineral and coconut aromas blend well together, and the palate is warm, full-bodied and deep, with ripe berry, chocolate and warmth.

107464,US,"From the Los Alamos region, this young, firm Pinot wants a little time in the bottle to mellow. Tasted in January, it's unresolved in tannins, fresh acidity, oak (76% new) and primary cherry and raspberry fruit. Should be a very fine wine sometime toward 2011.",Highlands Estates Los Robles,91,30.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Kendall-Jackson
107465,US,"A curious wine. It's not tasting at all good now. So tannic, so new oaky, it feels clumsy and astringent and awkward in the mouth. Then you realize how rich the heart of fruit is, offering an enormous array of blackberries, blueberries and black currants. The grapes are from Rutherford. The gamble is if the fruit will outlast the tannins.",Wykoff Vineyard,91,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Neal Family
107466,US,"Unusually rich and concentrated for a Merlot. Shows classic structure, with firm, ripe tannins and good acidity, although the oak sticks out. A small percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon adds a blackberry depth to the cherries and raspberries.

107467,US,"Sineann's Champoux vineyard Merlot is barely out of barrel, tight, bright and spicy with sharply-defined flavors of red berries and red licorice. Though it passes 15% alcohol, it is neither sweet nor unctuous; the fine acidity cuts through beautifully. This will certainly benefit from a few more years of cellaring.",Champoux Vineyard,91,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Sineann
107468,US,"This is three quarters Syrah, sourced from Klipsun, Hedges Bel Villa, and Lewis; with a touch of Merlot from the Meek vineyard. Dark, spicy and lush, its sappy fruit has a lively snap to it, with a hint of licorice and smoke. Not the funky “in the rocks” Walla Walla style of Syrah, this is for those who want the fruit forward, front and center.",Ruckus,91,38.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Sparkman
107469,US,"Rich, smooth and balanced, with the sort of dusty chocolate mouthfeel generally associated with much pricier Bordeaux blends, this is the winery's salute to the Horse Heaven Hills AVA.

107470,US,"The vineyard is a very fine one that has been source to great Syrahs from Ojai as well as Rockroom. Their 2006 is a near copy of the 2005. It's ripe and soft, filled with blackberry jam, cherry liqueur and dark chocolate flavors that finish with pepper and cinnamon. Drink this very rich wine with roasted chicken or a grilled flank steak.",White Hawk Vineyard,91,39.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,Rockroom Winemaking Cooperative
107471,US,"Concentrated and stylish, this is a potent Merlot with sharp, ripe, tight fruit flavors.

107472,US,"From an excellent vintage, with 10% Merlot and 10% Malbec in the blend, this is Dusted Valley's first-ever estate wine.

107474,Chile,"Dark, sweet, subtle and smooth, with complexity that's unleashed with proper airing. There's minerality and perfume on the nose, and while it's rich and supple in the mouth, the blackberry, raisin and fig flavors are not saggy. Pillowy, but with good concentration.

107477,US,"Pure Cabernet Sauvignon, this concentrated wine captures the essence of the grape as interpreted through this hot climate vineyard.

107480,Argentina,"Brick in color and a bit Bordeaux-like in aromas, mouthfeel and flavors.

107482,Chile,"Opens with a good spread of herbs, perfume, black fruit and sauciness, while the palate is lively and healthy, with raspberry, plum and herbal shadings.

107486,Argentina,"Spice and clay notes grace this earthy Cabernet-led wine that sports black cherry, berry and earth notes. The palate is forward and grabby, with rubbery tannins to go with flavors of roasted berries, plum sauce, chocolate and savory spices.

107488,France,"Tight, taut steely in character, this tastes of its great chalk terroir. It has delicious layered crispness, green and fresh red apples, finished with a powerful citrus element. Without doubt, a wine for aging.",Montmains Premier Cru,91,35.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Simonnet-Febvre
107489,US,"Despite the high (15.4%) alcohol, this sleek and textural Merlot manages to seem elegant.

Astringent and polished tannins complete a sexy, seductive bottle.",Reserve,91,30.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Merlot,Hogue
107490,Chile,"Like the Chilean Merlot of olden days, this one is fairly mulchy and astringent. And it's also a bit old tasting, with some core berry fruit but mostly earthy flavors and forced spice. Some red fruit on the finish helps it, but still there isn't much essence to this wine.",Viejo Feo,83,11.0,Maule Valley,,,Merlot,Viña Tinajas
107491,Chile,"A hot and chunky wine with slightly chemical/medicinal aromas leading to gummy raspberry and strawberry flavors.

107495,Chile,"A decent attempt at a serious blended white wine, but age and other things aren't working in its favor. Lettuce and other green aromas draw down the nose, while the palate is creamsicle-like in texture and flavor. Some drying wood on the finish keeps it in check. Not improving, either. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC.",Special Reserve,83,23.0,Limarí Valley,,,White Blend,Tamaya
107496,Chile,"A bit aggressive and hot at first, and then mossy and earthy. The palate delivers weight and forceful acidity, while the berry flavors are robust but grating and weighed down by a lot of warm, woody overtones. Like a bucking mule; at $28 it seeks to be more than it is.",Altum Single Vineyard,83,28.0,Maipo Valley,,,Merlot,TerraMater
107497,Chile,"The aromas of baked apple and light spice are good, but after a bit of spritz greets you the palate does a fast fade. Along the way there's banana and mango flavors and then a soft but rather hollow finish.",Reserva,83,11.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Apaltagua

107502,Chile,"Just like the prior vintage, this wine may be organic but it's not all that good. The color is opaque purple and the nose is jammy like Jungle Juice.

107505,Chile,"Not too bad on the nose but tangy, jumpy and overexcited in the mouth, with exaggerated nectarine and citrus flavors. Aggressive after the bouquet, with no elegance. Year after year this wine is lively but fails to impress us.",Santa Digna Selection Rosé,82,11.0,Central Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Miguel Torres

107521,US,"This is a Cab-based Bordeaux blend, and it shows Paso's ability to produce a ripe, gentle red wine that's immediately appealing.

107522,US,"Rarely bottled on its own, Pinot Meunier is better known as a blending component for Champagne.

107528,Italy,"This Sangiovese seems older than it is because of the hard candy, mineral and brambly notes that offset its aromas of dark chocolate and sweet spice.

107537,Spain,"Inky dark, with deep berry, sandalwood and sawmill aromas. Color and potency are not lacking in this modern-styled Tempranillo, which hits like a hammer.

107620,Austria,"Vulcano is the German spelling. Quite a mix of grapes, here: Blaufränkisch, Cabernet Sauvignon, Zweigelt and Merlot. One of Austria's top red winemakers, Hans Igler revels in the power of this wine, taming it with smooth tannins, new wood and rich density.

107623,Austria,"Made from Zweigelt, this is Franz Leth's flagship red. It shows a much more serious, austere side to Zweigelt, one which needs aging.

107633,Italy,"Winemaker Romano Dal Forno fearlessly confronted the soggy 2002 vintage with high extraction techniques and barrique aging (36 months). This is an inky, dense wine (more syrupy than it is vinous) with black currant, peppermill, chocolate fudge and big firm wood tannins.

107745,Spain,"Saucy dark fruit leads toward a palate that's hard, tight and full of rambunctious cherry, raspberry and plum flavors.

107746,US,"This wine has a ridiculous alcohol of 16.3%, which makes it prickly, and the dryness makes it taste even hotter, since there's no sugar to balance and soften.

107752,US,"I really liked the past releases of this wine, but the '04 is not in the same league.

107760,US,"A barrel-fermented, single-vineyard designate, this vivacious Viognier brings suggestions of summer cocktails—specifically margaritas and gin and tonics. The spicy, pear-flavored fruit seems to be edged with salt and fresh-sqeezed lime, which is not to say that it isn't a beautifully crafted wine.

107761,Chile,"Gets better the longer it's open, but starts with perfumed aromas of bright berry fruit and mineral.

107762,Italy,"This is a difficult wine to understand, with a very specific philosophy behind it. Light, elegant and ethereal, the 60-40 blend of Nero d'Avola and Frappato is aged in terracotta amphorae in a studied attempt to present as pure a product as nature allows. It offers loads of bright fruit, wild berries, earth, spice and impressive complexity.",Pithos,91,40.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Cerasuolo di Vittoria,,Red Blend,COS

107764,US,"What's so delightful about this Cabernet is that it shows classic Oakville structure in a wine that's immediately drinkable. While it will take bottle age, it's elegant and enjoyable now, with refined tannins and a brisk hit of acidity framing dry flavors of blackberries and black currants that close an earthy hint of mint and herbs.

107766,US,"Tasted in January, this Merlot was still quite unresolved. Oak dominated, with its characteristic vanilla and caramel notes, while underneath was a substantial core of cherries, blackberries, currants, cocoa and roasted almonds, reminiscent of a granola bar.

107769,Italy,This “classico” interpretation of Nero d'Avola and Frappato from COS is every bit as enjoyable as the producer's top-shelf Pithos expression.

107780,US,"There's a funky note of old leather permeating this Pinot Noir.

107786,Chile,"Shows very nice fruit that's both jammy and firm, and then add in meatiness, leather and rubber and you have an intense, tannic middleweight with cassis, dark berry and plenty of chocolate in terms of flavors.

107787,US,"Shows the exuberant volume and power of most Santa Lucia Pinot Noirs, with strong, jammy cherry, raspberry and cola flavors and big, sturdy tannins, although the wine never loses its essentially silky texture.

107789,US,"The new oak sticks out on this Syrah, with caramel, buttered toast and vanilla dominating the underlying blackberry and cherry fruit.

107791,Chile,"A big-time dud given Torres' track record in Chile. This wine, no matter how you cut it, is flat, vegetal and smells and tastes of corn.

107796,Chile,"Powdery fruit and air freshener aromas are probably the best part of this narrow, unfriendly rosé. Sour citrus flavors rest on lemon, while the palate is piercingly acidic.

107801,US,"With this bottling Goldschmidt runs with the big Oakville dogs. Classic, a dry, tremendously concentrated and oaky Cab with massive flavors of blackberry tart, cassis, anise, cocoa and cedar.

107802,US,"This is taut, muscular, toasty, young and tight; the fruit is concentrated, pure and evocative, with earthy flavors that add notes of soil, spice and mineral.

107803,US,"The vineyard is in Fulton, a cool part of the southeastern valley heavily influenced by fog, and the vines are about 100 years old. This is great, classic Zinfandel. It should be in a museum. Despite high alcohol, it has a silky, Pinot-esque suppleness, balanced with crisp acids, and is profoundly rich in Zinny flavor.

107805,US,"Made in the Merry Edwards style, which is powerfully ripe and extracted, yet always balanced. Dazzles with enormous cherry pie filling, cola, sassafras, beef jerky, raspberry tart, anise, pepper and smoky cedar flavors that finish with amazing length.

107824,US,"The winery has struggled with Pinot made from this warm, sunny highland appellation, which is more suitable for Zinfandel.

107834,US,"It's terribly hard to make an expensive, upscale Cab Franc that succeeds. The variety on its own tends toward cherry fruit simplicity. In this bottling, von Strasser has added Merlot and even Zinfandel to perk things up with dark stone fruit and tannic depth.

107843,US,"This small production (200 cases) Pinot Noir is a mix of older and younger estate vines, a selection of lots given 22 months in 60 and 132 gallon French oak casks.

107845,US,"This Pinot Noir, named for a particular soil type in the Willamette valley, is scented strongly of the lumber smell you get at a building supplies store.

107851,US,"This is a spicy take on Cabernet, with some of the pepper and smoked meat character of Syrah coming through, despite the fairly small amount in the blend.

108045,US,"This displayed a medicinal aroma, and tasted like candied cherry cough medicine. That candied taste lingered into the finish, where the wine turned slightly harsh.",Reserve,83,100.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sullivan
108046,Spain,"Lots of charred oak and leathery fruit start it out, and then you get runaway berry flavors and screechy, almost grabby tannins.

The black and purple fruits dominate, as expressive and ripe as any Syrah in the state. It's still young, a bit oaky, and relatively high in alcohol. Give it some bottle age and all the complexity will come into focus.",RiverBend Vineyard,93,40.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Fielding Hills
108209,France,"92—94 Barrel sample. Great, solid wine, intensely structured, balanced with sufficient new wood. This has excellent potential, a wine with some freshness, but more weight from the ripe black fruits.",Barrel sample,93,,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Durfort-Vivens
108210,Austria,"Red plums and black cherries dominate this ripe, fruity wine, which brings in plenty of fresh acidity to balance the dry underlying tannins.

108211,Italy,"The Valpantena Valley produces hearty, structured wines that are usually priced more competitively than those from the Classico zone. Bertani's Villa Arvedi is a case in point. It delivers all the qualities you look for in excellent Amarone: intensity and diversity of aromas such as almond paste, currant berry, Indian spice and deep oak tones. It has polished tannins and a playful note of sour cherry on the finish.",Villa Arvedi,90,25.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella Valpantena,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Bertani
108212,Italy,"Cantina di Negrar is an ambitious, quality-minded cooperative with 200 members totaling 1,200 acres of vineyard.

108214,Germany,"This delectable kabinett starts off with amazingly pure scents of crushed stone, lime and apple, then follows up with flavors of strawberries to go with more apples and limes.

108215,US,"Morgan's '05 Rosella's is a very fine and enjoyable Pinot, but it has a brittle, slightly unripe sharpness that defines its limits.

108218,US,"Drier, tarter and more minerally than usual, this elegant Viognier-Marsanne blend comes from a vineyard in the northern part of the Santa Lucia Highlands.

108219,Italy,"Dark tones of black cherry and raisin are immediate and upfront but are soon followed by fresh notes of blackberry, mulberry and almond amaretto.

108221,US,"Few Cabs smell more inviting, with come-hither scents of wild blackberries, freshly brewed coffee, raspberry pie and toasted vanilla cream.

108227,US,"This is a very concentrated and intense young Sauvignon Blanc. With 43% new oak, it shows a rich creaminess riding over the laser-like gooseberry, grapefruit and lime flavors.

108228,France,"Maybe this lacks the stylistic minerality of Savennières because of the hot vintage, but it replaces that with richness, creamy opulence and developing flavors of vanilla and almonds, leaving the acidity bringing up the final taste. Screwcap.",,89,22.0,Loire Valley,Savennières,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine des Baumard
108229,Austria,"This very spicy, new wood dominated wine, tastes initially only of toast. It's hard to find the fruit, but underneath all that wood is a lively, berry fruited wine waiting to get out.

108296,US,"This wine immediately wows the palate, bursting into full flavor with an explosion of apple and pear fruit.

108299,US,"Produced from this famous cool-climate vineyard, the wine is zesty in acidity and dry, but enormously rich and impressive in pineapple and pear flavors, with a distinct minerality that makes it feel drier and earthier.

The finish is more earthy, suggesting the wine still needs time in the bottle.",Vaillons Premier Cru,90,32.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Simonnet-Febvre
108331,US,"This is a Merlot-dominated Bordeaux blend. Along with pleasant, strawberry fruit you'll find scents of candied roses and hints of fresh herb.

108334,US,"Hogue's Genesis bottling is far more limited than the winery's other Rieslings, and offers extra dimensions in terms of concentration and grip. Though just 12.6% alcohol, it tastes dry enough, with juicy acidity and green apple flavors.

108335,US,"As with all Dusted Valley wines, the focus is on varietal purity, and the careful blending (an addition of 10% Merlot) enhances it, by expanding the midpalate and adding complexity.

108336,US,"Clearly varietal from the first whiff, this elegant Cabernet Sauvignon sets out a smorgasbord of flavors: plum, cassis, smoke, loam, a hint of the barnyard.

108337,Chile,"A big step up from the first time we tried this wine in 2007. Aromas are pure and fruity, while the palate is ripe and acid-rich, with juicy but tight plum, herb and berry flavors.

108338,US,"Pure varietal, just 13.5% alcohol, and priced in the low $20s—that would seem to be a recipe for a thin, wimpy red. Not here. Scents of bramble and baked bread, smoke and crushed rock, mingle with strawberry/cranberry fruit. The smoke has a wood fire penetration, but it works here, as the wine opens into a finish of caramel and buttered nuts.",,90,22.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Merlot,Robert Karl
108339,US,"A classic Meritage, with all five Bordeaux grapes in the mix. While stylistically in line with other Powers reds, this is the most graceful in its handling of the fruit and application of new oak.

108340,US,"One of the best Sangiovese out there, mainly due to the ripe balance. Avoids the unripeness or excessive ripeness that can mar this variety in California.

108342,Canada,"With over 80 apples used to produce each bottle, there's no question as to what the dominating fruit character is here. Aromas of apple skins, clove and ginger on the nose transition to flavors of candied apple, white grape and honeyed apricot in the sticky, viscous mouth. Long and lingering on the finish; a dessert wine sure to please those with a sweet tooth.",Ice Apple Wine,89,33.0,Canada Other,Canada,,Apple,Domaine Pinnacle
108343,Italy,"Here's a brightly saturated Pinot Grigio with toasted notes of almond, freshly baked bread and creamy butter.

108344,Argentina,"Consistently a very good Cabernet, with big, broad roasted aromas backing solid black fruit. The palate is rich, rugged and powerful, with mildly baked plum and blackberry flavors.

There is a delicious final acidity.",Les Belles Vignes,89,27.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Fournier Père et Fils
108349,France,"This wine might start off a touch medicinal but that blows off rather quickly, allowing the beautiful bouquet full of red cherry and raspberry with soft touches of cocoa to shine through.

108351,France,"There is good density of fruit tannins here, boosted by wood. The wine has dried fruit, spice, perfumed blackberry and lively acidity. It could well age for 1–2 years.",Réserve,89,19.0,Loire Valley,Chinon,,Cabernet Franc,Domaine du Grand Bouqueteau
108352,US,"Banana fruit flavors are somewhat mitigated by old vine character and the inherent acidity of Yakima Valley grapes.

108353,Chile,"A powerful, dark and alluring specimen with chocolate, olive paste, road tar and blackberry aromas.

Not spectacular but very good.",Single Vineyard Alto de Piedras,89,30.0,Maipo Valley,,,Carmenère,De Martino
108354,US,"Though it lacks the broad, sweet fruit of the 2005 reserve, this is a fine reflection of the vintage. It's compact, tannic, and a bit unyielding, but structured with enough density to age for a few years.

108359,France,"Aromas of anise and black plum flesh along with hints of eucalyptus and leather abound on the nose, while flavors of fresh-picked black berries fill out the medium-weight mouth.

108388,Spain,"Cheerful at first, with bubble gum and berry drink mix aromas. The fun pretty much stops there; what follows is astringent berry flavors and a lean, choppy finish. Juicy but lacks sytle and finesse.",Cosecha,82,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Valcortes
108389,US,"There's a sharp, minty smell and taste in this as well as hard tannins and cutting acidity, all of which hint at less-than-ripe grapes. The wine is fully dry, but lacks the sensuality you want in Merlot.",Estate,82,18.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Wellington
108390,Argentina,"About five years into its existence and Colomé has found its groove in this excellent, luscious Malbec-Cabernet blend.

Good now through 2013.",Reserva,93,90.0,Other,Calchaquí Valley,,Red Blend,Colomé

108392,Argentina,"Inky dark and an outstanding example of high-end Malbec. This is the finest Alta we've tried; it is ripe as can be but not raisiny. The palate is creamy and lush, but with good acidic balance. And the flavors of black fruits, chocolate and spice make it a league-leader. Drink now through 2012.",Catena Alta,93,57.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
108393,US,"The vineyard is the source of fantastic Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays for several wineries, and Barnett scores big points with this lush, rich but balanced wine.

108394,US,"It's nice that they've held back this wine for a few years before releasing it, because it's beginning to meld together in a very delightful way. The tannins, oak and alcohol are coalescing with the cherries, pomegranates, cola, tangerine, vanilla and spices, giving the wine a silky, complex, mellow mouthfeel. Beautifully dry and lush now, and should develop through 2012.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,93,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Affaire de Coeur
108395,US,"Collaboration Series III is also Syrah, a blend of four clones, giving a meatier, less toasty wine than the Series II Syrah, but with the same imprint of Ciel du Cheval fruit.

108406,US,"Young and thick in tannins, this Pinot will benefit from some time in the bottle.

Better after 2011.",Pommard Clone,92,55.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Fess Parker
108407,Germany,"This terrific dry Riesling features a complex interplay of mineral notes, honey, peach, citrus and dried spices.

108410,US,"This new vintage offers the same blend as the 2005—62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc.

108414,Spain,"Astrales has really nailed it the past couple of years, and while the '06 isn't quite as good as 2005, it's still an excellent wine.

108418,Australia,"To me, Glen Eldon's Dry Bore Shiraz exemplifies many of the positive attributes of Barossa Shiraz. The blackberry fruit is powerful, complemented by copious vanilla and toast notes from oak maturation. There's plenty of weight and concentration, but no excessively dry or hard tannins—in fact, it's almost silky.

108420,US,"This is quite light, almost ephemeral, with tart raspberry and red licorice flavors and a strong metallic/mineral streak.

108431,US,"Another lovely wine from Chaddsford, with both class and a delicate touch.

108434,Italy,"This is a light and breezy blend of Sangiovese and Merlot that doesn't have huge intensity but that does have a nice focus on fruit.

108436,Spain,"A lean and peppery style of Rioja that's very much from the old school.

108439,Spain,This Macabeo (Viura) blend is neutral on the nose but fairly big and bulky on the palate. Flavors of lemon-lime and banana are spritzy at first and then stickier late. The rest of the composition (Macabeo and Parellada) dictates that the flavors will be short; but what's on display is nice and creamy.,Proyecto Cu4tro Blanco,86,10.0,Catalonia,Catalunya,,White Blend,Bodegas Concavins

108443,Spain,"A powerful berry-based wine with no oak is what's on offer. The nose exudes rubber and leather at first, and then comes a wave of rambunctious black fruit.

And once again: no oak!",,86,10.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza
108444,Spain,"Persistently murky and leafy on the nose, this traditional-style Rioja brings juicier, brighter fruit to the palate along with some tangy, somewhat sharp acids.

108456,US,"The winery calls this unoaked Chardonnay “Homage to Chablis,” presumably because it's a high-acid, low alcohol wine whose main flavors are of minerals, with subtle elements of citrus zest and pear.

108461,US,"Sharp, minty-peppery and tannicly dry in its youth, this Syrah is rich enough in fruit to warrant some years in the cellar.

108465,Spain,"During the harvest last fall winemaker and owner Vicki Pariente said 2007 would be a lean year in Rueda with some great wines. Hers is very pungent and full of nettles, sweat and other cool-climate symptoms. Which doesn't make it a bad wine; just tight, lean and green.

108474,US,"It's quite different from the winery's inaugural 2005 Sangiovese, with more sweet cranberry fruit and chewy, peppery tannins.

108475,Argentina,"Big and strong, with full but easy black-fruit aromas.

Along the way there are hints of herbs, coffee and cherry cough drop.",Select,87,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trivento
108476,Argentina,"Ruca Malen's wines never taste manipulated or tweaked. This Malbec-Cabernet blend has a robust, meaty nose with licorice in the rear.

108478,Germany,"From a little-seen village of the Middle Mosel, this is a solid effort.

108479,Romania,"An intriguing nose of lemon, orange and flowers leads on this balanced white from Romania.

108482,US,"This is the biggest, most tannic and closed of the winery's three new 2007 Syrahs, and also the one most likely to improve in the cellar. It's intense and concentrated in pure blackberry and black cherry fruit, with the pepper, bacon, earth and smoky oak notes you want in a good 100% Syrah. But then, there are those big tannins. Give it a good 4–6 years.",Unti Vineyard,93,38.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Olson Ogden
108483,US,"Titus's regular '06 Cab is a wonderful wine. Their Reserve is even better, showing a more dramatic structure of smooth, complex tannins and a more intense, fruity profile.

Delicious now and through 2013.",Reserve,93,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Titus
108484,US,"Succulent, liquorous, dense and tart—this is superb Washington Merlot.

108488,US,"The 10th vintage of Eroica may be the best ever. It's supremely fresh, spicy, and mineral-driven.

108492,US,"This is a limited production 100% Cab from the winery's estate vineyard. It's much more tannic than Cohn's extraordinarily fine '04 Estate, which was released a year ago. Even at the age of five-plus, it stings with sandpapery astringency. Should easily negotiate the years, with its massive core of blackberries, black currants, olives and 100% new oak.

108494,US,"Not ready for drinking now. Shows youthfully aggressive tannins and forward flavors of blackberries, currants, herbs and unintegrated new oak, making it the least satisfactory of Stonestreet's impressive new releases if you're looking for something now.

108496,US,"This is a big, powerful and still young Cabernet blend that's not ready to drink yet. The massive blackberry, black currant, violet and dark chocolate flavors haven't meshed with the smoky oak, while a cut of fruity acidity makes for a tart mouthfeel.

108505,US,"There's tons of cherry, cola and licorice flavor in this vigorous young Pinot. It also shows an earthy streak of herbs and mushrooms, suggesting a sautéed Portobello splashed with balsamic. The result is complex and fascinating, yet vigorous tannins and keen acidity warrant time in the cellar. Give it through 2011.",Olivet Lane,93,60.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards
108506,US,"You could enjoy this Chardonnay now, because it has lush pineapple, pear and mineral flavors, and smoky oak adds delicious notes of vanilla, honey and buttered toast.

108507,US,"Extremely dark, inky, black, impenetrable; dense in every way, this highly extracted wine is a real tongue-stainer.

108508,US,"Feels a bit thick and heavy now, with jammy raspberry, cherry, mocha and sandalwood flavors, but so good, so pure that a few years in the cellar have to benefit.

108511,Italy,"This producer buys wine to age and bottle under the estate label.

108512,Argentina,"Like its little brother Calvulcura, this wine is Cabernet Sauvignon mixed with Merlot. It's a big boy with stewed berries, prune and licorice on the bouquet.

108515,Argentina,"Movie popcorn, baked fruits and plenty of toast and vanilla work the entry, while forward flavors of apple and pear are kicked up a notch by full acidity.

108517,Italy,"Despite its deep concentration and evident power, here is a food-friendly wine (think pheasant stuffed with mushrooms or polenta with wild boar) that balances brawn with soft tones of vanilla, nut and bright fruit.

108521,Germany,"Intensely sweet, as you might expect, with scents of honey, dried apricots and clover.

108649,Argentina,"Tight and rubbery at first, but with time it settles to show jammy wild-berry aromas and density.

108652,US,"A sound, rich Syrah whose deep flavors are wrapped into a fine, sturdy structure.

Now–2012, for fresh fruitiness.",Larner Vineyard,89,42.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,Jaffurs
108653,US,"Tastes more like a Zinfandel than a Cabernet, with a briary mouthfeel and flavors of black pepper and weedy green nettles. But there's lots of blackberry and black currant richness, and the wine is totally dry, with full-bodied, thick tannins.

108654,Argentina,"Floral and fruity on the nose, with a strong bouquet of cassis, blackberry and ink.

108699,US,"A classic combination, this pits earthy, muscular Cabernet Sauvignon against a roughly equal amount of spicy, peppery, audacious Syrah, taking the best from each.

108702,US,"Cedary and tight, this young, sappy wine has exceptional concentration and weight.

108704,US,"Delicious and immediately appealing with fresh strawberry and Bing cherry fruit, leading into sweet toasty oak and the precisely detailed tannins that characterize John Abbott's winemaking.

108707,France,"An absolute gem from respected Languedoc produer Gérard Bertrand. The aromas draw you in immediately with intense, brooding notes of coffee, black fruit preserves, cocoa and tea leaves.

108709,Germany,"This wine's initial aromatics come across as rather subdued, but give them some time and they begin to unfurl into minerally billows of slate and citrus.

108713,US,"This is the winery's flagship red; in this vintage it's 64% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot and 14% Syrah. Sturdy and structured to age, the Syrah component pops in the pepper and spice, while the Cab and Merlot give it muscle and verve.

Hard to exaggerate the depth and length, the sheer opulence of this 100% Cab. It was aged in 80% new French oak, which adds even richer notes of wood smoke and sweet vanilla.

It's light years away from the Leonetti's of the 1980s—compact and loaded with black fruits, pepper, fresh herbs, rock, earth, toast and smoke. It's so tight that it's almost impossible to dissect.

A triumph.",To Kalon Vineyard Reserve,95,35.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Fumé Blanc,Robert Mondavi
108935,US,"This wine is so loaded with glycerine, it actually pours slow from the bottle, like honey. With 17.4 grams of residual sugar, it's decadently, deliriously sweet, but sugar is not its only charm. There's a fabulous flood of apricots, pineapples, peaches and limes, concentrated to their essence and geléed, enriched with pure vanilla and clover honey and dusted with cinnamon.

108938,France,"From a relatively open vintage, this is a wine that is generous, rounded, full of green fruits, and balanced with a ripe texture. It has weight, but has more to do with sheer pleasure.

108941,US,"A dark, rich wine, this opens with ripe, sweet aromas of fresh blackberries, cedar, cigar box, pencil lead and cinnamon.

108945,US,"This is surely the most ambitious Cabernet Franc/Conner Lee wine ever made, and it's priced accordingly. I love the purity, the focus and the way it plays across the palate; it's a real high-wire act. Cab Franc does not lend itself to either elegance or completeness as a varietal grape, which is why it is almost always blended. But here it is the whole show, and it's razzle dazzle all the way. Ripe blackberry and black cherry fruit is framed in spice and tannin, with a sweetness rarely found. The finishing notes of fresh roasted coffee and mocha linger sensuously in the back of the mouth.

108947,France,"Yes, at 12 years this is now mature, but it still has plenty of life.

108953,US,"They say the vines are 85 years old, and I can believe it, because these authentically old Zin vines are intense. It's not just intensity of cherry-berry fruit, but of substances that seem to exist deep in the soil, like stones and minerals and organic matter and decomposing volcanic litter and old compounds washed down from the mountains over time. I like this dry, tannic, complex Zinfandel a lot.",Old Vine Gaddis Vineyard,93,28.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hawley
108954,US,"A dark and spicy wine, with streaks of mineral and herb buried within very tart, acidic black fruit. This is complex, quite youthful and tightly woven. I think it will require some years to pull itself together, but the balance is here, in a medium-bodied style, showing some herb, some citrus and plenty of muscle.

Its quality is evident thanks to the velvety and rich feel the wine imparts in the mouth and its bright aromas of peach and apricot. This wine has extraordinary length on the finish too.

108993,US,"A beautiful example of a fine Alexander Valley Cab, with dusty tannins and an herbal, thyme and sage note to the ripe blackberries, cherries, currants and cedar.

108994,US,"Nothing shy about this powerhouse Syrah. A barrel selection from Morgan's cool-climate vineyard, it's bone dry and strong in acids and tannins, with underlying flavors of blackberries, sour cherries, tobacco, mint, anise and spices, especially crushed black peppercorn.

108996,Portugal,"A serious, impressive wine, packed with the dark tannins of Touriga Nacional. It also has an elegance that gives it shape, structure and surprising poise for such a rich, juicy wine.

108998,US,"Few winemakers in California understand acidity better than Randall Grahm, and he provides plenty of it in this brilliantly clean, bone-dry wine.

109001,Argentina,"Smoky and sultry smelling, with berry jam aromas and ample subtleties. The palate is tannic and lively, like a good, masculine youngster should be.

109002,Australia,"Greenock is a highly regarded subsection of the Barossa, and this is a fine example of Shiraz from that region.

109003,Spain,"The nose is all dense blackberries, while the palate is deep, flashy and ripe, with flavors of black cherry and blackberry.

Drink now through 2012.",Élite,91,36.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Muruve
109004,US,"This is quite a good Pinot Noir, and one to drink now for its silky deliciousness.

Hard to imagine anyone not liking it a lot.",Coster Vineyard,91,42.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Vision Cellars
109005,Australia,"The aromas of this wine are undoubtedly complex: meaty, stewy, cedary and jammy—there's a lot going on, just not all going in the same direction. Yet it seems to come together on the palate, where it offers a creamy, mouthfilling texture, turning chewier on the finish.

109006,US,"There's a lot of oak on this Chard, sourced from multiple vineyards, and the barrel influences currently dominate, with the vanilla, butterscotch and caramel flavors many people confuse with the taste of Chardonnay itself.

109007,US,"Herbal, peppery, tannic and slightly green, but very flavorful and interesting. Green coffee bean flavors are pure varietal; the tannins are tight and compact, with penetrating flavors.

109008,Portugal,"Made from the vineyards of Casa de Santar, this is the result of an exercise in old-style white wine making, but without the oxidation.

109009,Hungary,"A beautiful, aromatic nose of honey, orange, apricot and spice unfolds extravagantly in this elegant dessert wine.

109010,Germany,"Right now the aromas are a bit tight—even steely—with just modest hints of apple and lime, but the fruit comes to the fore on the palate, exploding with baked apple and spice flavors, balanced by zippy acids.

The listed alcohol remains under 14%.",Reserve,91,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Waterbrook
109014,Australia,"A large, relatively new winery in Western Australia's Margaret River GI, Watershed has turned out an admirable 2004 Shiraz, boasting a cool-climate note of cracked pepper that accents its raspberry and mint aromas and flavors.

109015,Portugal,"Many see the Touriga Nacional in the Dão as superior to the same grape in the Douro.

The structure is solid, with a firm, spicy elegance.",,91,32.0,Dão,,,Touriga Nacional,Quinta dos Roques

109019,US,"The 2005 Ursa is similar in style to the previous blends – 55% Merlot, 28% Cab Franc, 7% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Malbec and 3% Petit Verdot. A nice ripe vintage, it's a beefy version of this popular Bordeaux blend, with more black fruits than red, and somewhat rugged, substantial, lightly earthy tannins.

109025,Israel,"Fairly young and needing some time to flesh out, this blend still has much to offer now.

109029,Italy,"As much as Tuscany and Syrah seem to be a match made in heaven, this wine is lower in overall intensity and rather neutral in aromas.

109032,US,"This is 100% Pinot Noir, tart and young and juicy, and at this price it's a pretty fair value.

109033,Spain,"A little baked and flat smelling, with licorice and stewed fruit aromas. Sounds kind of dark and heavy, right?

109034,US,"Barrel fermented and aged on the lees for almost a year, this is a nutty, slightly oily wine that shows the influence of the barrel, but lacks the fruit density to match it.

109074,Austria,"Very light, elegant, fresh wine, crisp in the extreme, deliciously perfumed with its white flower aromas and hedgerow fruits.

109075,US,"It's silky and gentle in tannins and rich in cherry, tobacco, pine and spice flavors that finish dry. It's also sharper in acids than many other red wines, but that's what helps Sangiovese cut through rich cheeses and meats, and stand up to tomato sauce.",Brunello di Sonoma,87,60.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sangiovese,Petroni

109078,Argentina,"By far the best wine in the El Fogón lineup is this Torrontes. The nose is clean and harmonious, with light flower blossom scents.

109079,Italy,"This Prosecco Brut (made with 5% Chardonnay for extra smoothness) delivers floral aromas of dried lavender and rose backed by mineral tones and pulpy peach.

109084,US,"This is a deeply ripe, authoritatively structured Syrah of great power and finesse. It's drinkable now for the velvety texture and massive flavors of grilled blackberries, blueberries, currants, dark unsweetened chocolate, leather, black pepper and lots of sweet, smoky new oak.

109085,US,"A beautiful sparkling wine, and a rare release from this winery that usually produces multi-county blends.

109093,US,"A strongly flavored blush, forward and bold in cherries, raspberries, vanilla, smoke and spices, and even suggestions of exotic mulberries. Dark in color, too.

109094,US,"An interesting Pinot Noir marked by the acidity and primary fruit of extreme youth.

109095,US,"Here's a big, rich, extracted Cabernet, filled with fruit, yet balanced with a bracing minerality that must come from the earth.

109106,US,"A big, thick, heavy Pinot Noir, showing the ripe flavors that a good Santa Lucia Highlands Pinot Noir usually has.

109107,US,"A bit ungainly now, with massive red and black cherry flavors that burst out in jammy richness. But this is Mayacamas, whose Cabernets are built to last.

This is a tour de force of Australian winemaking that should be consumed 2010–2025.",Astralis,98,325.0,South Australia,Clarendon,,Syrah,Clarendon Hills
109161,Australia,"One of the more obviously ageworthy offerings from Clarendon Hills, the 2004 Hickinbotham Syrah boasts a wonderfully perfumed bouquet of flowers, minerals and spice. Then it backs up those captivating aromatics with rich blueberry fruit shaded with mint and cracked pepper and a long, firmly tannic and minerally finish. Drink 2010–2020.",Hickinbotham,96,100.0,South Australia,Clarendon,,Syrah,Clarendon Hills
109162,US,"Over many years Dolce has established itself as one of the top dessert wines in California, and the '02 doesn't disappoint. Enormously rich in apricot, tangerine and roasted coconut flavors, with plenty of botrytis notes, the wine was aged in 100% new French oak, and oozes in sweet vanilla char and crème brûlée.",Late Harvest Wine,96,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,Dolce
109163,US,"This is a gorgeous wine, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. It's light and delicate, but powerful, and boasts delicious cherry pie, cassis, cocoa, char and spice flavors. It possesses the kind of tannins that are soft and sweet now, but firm enough to hold the wine for many years. Best now, or anytime through 2015.",T-bar-T Benchmark,96,70.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Blend,Iron Horse
109164,US,"What a wonderful Pinot Noir, a joy to sip as it warms and changes in the glass. It's a very young wine, dry, sappy and acidic, with a tremendous depth of cherry preserves, licorice, cocoa, oaky spice and something wild and mushroomy that comes from the earth. As good as it is now, it should improve for a decade.",McDougall Vineyard,95,52.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
109165,US,"Four things define this wine. Extraordinarily ripe fruit, high acidity, a terroir-driven minerality, and lots of new French oak. The flavors are of tropical fruits, the ripest white peaches and vanilla cream, baked into spicy pastry crust. The impression is of impossible richness, California Chardonnay at its most opulent, flamboyant limit.",Dutton Ranch Rued Vineyard,95,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton-Goldfield
109166,Australia,"If the Liandra is Bratasiuk's Côte-Rôtie, this is the wine he calls “more Hermitage.” And it does have some iron-like, minerally notes to it. But there's more New World suppleness and flesh as well, featuring lush plum and cassis fruit, some hickory-smoked bacon and layers of coffee and cream on the lengthy finish. Approachable now, but should be even better in five years and will easily last for 10–15.",Brookman,95,100.0,South Australia,Clarendon,,Syrah,Clarendon Hills
109167,Australia,"Cropped at a measly half ton per acre, this is Clarendon Hills' top Grenache bottling. It's tighter and denser than the other, more flamboyant offerings, needing time in the bottle to develop. For now, it's loaded with wonderfully pure blackberry and cassis fruit, but it promises to develop more complexity over the years; try from 2008–2020. Long and softly tannic on the finish.",Romas,95,100.0,South Australia,Clarendon,,Grenache,Clarendon Hills
109168,US,"I always think of Francis Coppola's Cask Cabernet as his hommage to the old Inglenook. It's 100% varietal, grown at the Rutherford estate, and a spectacular wine. Enormously oaky now, with an explosion of char and vanilla, it shows an underworld of black currants, and is huge in sweet, youthful tannins. Yet those tannins are so polished, so refined. This is a glamorous wine, tremendous now, and will hold and develop through 2020.",Cask,95,65.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rubicon Estate
109169,US,"In the wine's youth, the aroma of new oak dominates, with that smoky, minty, spicy-char note. But in the mouth the fruit explodes in intensely ripe black currants and milk chocolate. The tannins are rich and softly complex. A complete Cabernet that is luscious now,  but has the balance to develop, if you can keep your hands off it.",,94,115.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Far Niente
109170,US,"Very big and rich and extracted, offering massive flavors of cherries and raspberries, enriched with caramelized oak. Very delicious, if a little obvious.

109172,Argentina,"Here's a Bordeaux-style blend to snap up if you're lucky enough to find it. It's a definite re-issue in that it was first released at $25 in 2006 but was put back on the market last year at $15. And what a bargain it is: Earth, tar and tobacco vie with dried cherry and raspberry on the nose and palate; the finish is long, elegant and dry. A mature, classy wine to drink now.",Serie Magno Gran Reserva,90,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Fantelli
109173,France,"An intensely black-colored wine, with dark, smoky tannins to match. It does have a juicy, ripe sweet berry fruit element, laying under the surface tannins. With this power, it needs several years to develop.",Château de Mercuès,90,,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Georges Vigouroux
109174,US,"Very rich and ripe in fruit, and also rich in new oak. The combination makes for mouth-filling blackberry and cherry pie filling, currant, licorice, dark chocolate and spicy flavors that are frankly delicious.

109176,Germany,"Slight hint of sulfur at first, but it blows off and the nose opens to reveal a rich medley of ripe orchard fruit tinged with dried tarragon and savory spice. Crisp, bright and laden with a patchwork of flavors: ripe apples, pears and stone fruit against a backdrop of earthy minerality. Broad yet only medium bodied, with a moderately long finish.",Trocken,90,25.0,Pfalz,,,Chardonnay Weissburgunder,Knipser
109177,US,"A delicious Pinot Noir to drink now with upscale fare. It's very fruity, offering a burst of raspberries and cherries, together with a coat of sweet, smoky oak. But crisp acidity and smooth, silky tannins provide a balanced structure.",Falcon's Perch,90,17.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,J. Lohr

109179,US,"A real success in a challenging vintage, this is a meaty, flavorful, well-built Pinot Noir. The fruit is a mix of berries, especially strawberry, with accents of peach, cola, earth, sassafras and cinnamon. The wine keeps on going; it doesn't wimp out or turn bitter. It's interesting now, but should develop even more flavor with some years of cellaring.",SV Estate,90,40.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Stoller
109180,US,"A rich, extracted Syrah that treads the line between simple lusciousness and complex authority.

Drink now.",Originals,90,38.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Stolpman
109181,Argentina,"Plenty of mocha and vanilla combined with racy berry aromas give this an ice cream sundae-type of bouquet. The palate is healthy and snappy, with lively acidity pushing black cherry and meaty plum flavors. Whole and toasty on the finish, with touches of excellence throughout.

109182,US,"This limited-production offering pays tribute to Bill Fuller, founder of Tualatin Vineyards and one of the pioneers of Oregon's modern era wine industry.

109184,US,"Tart and slender, this is deceptive; at first it seems a little thin, but as it opens in the glass into a succulent, well-defined, racy wine with citrus and peach, mineral and herb. It's not delicate, but its muscularity is concealed behind elegant styling.",Her Silhouette,90,22.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay,Amalie Robert
109185,US,"This deceptive wine looks almost Pinot-like in color, but packs a myriad of flavors into its compact and raw frame. Rose petals, pomegranate, sour cherry, hints of cumin and nutmeg—it just keeps on going. Tannins are beautifully polished and the wine slowly unfolds, adding layers of flavor. Should improve for six to eight years and cellar for even longer.",Estate,90,35.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Southern Oregon,Tempranillo,Abacela
109186,US,"Good blackberry, cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors in this rich, dry wine, but it's also tight in tannins and brisk in acidity. Too hard and unsupple for drinking now.

109197,US,"This is a blend of grapes from Calistoga to Carneros. The wine shows Cabernet's full-bodied character and rather fierce tannins, although it has an enormous soul of blackberries, black currants and dark chocolate, as well as plenty of new oak.

109206,Hungary,"Though this dessert wine is already excellent, it's quite exciting to imagine how good it will be as its delicate flavors mingle over time. Made by the Szepsy family, whose roots go centuries (perhaps 1,000 years) deep in Hungary, the wine starts with a dense, slightly musky but floral nose. On the tongue, apricot, honey and spice mingle in a rich, opulent union, buoyed by a sparkling acidity that keeps the wine light and pretty.",Aszú 6 Puttonyos,93,,Tokaj,,,Tokaji,Szepsy

109211,France,"It is appropriate that Duval-Leroy has Femme as its top wine, since the company is run by one of the legendary “Champagne widows” Carol Duval-Leroy. This wine is an indication of the great quality now coming from this producer. It's an elegant wine, dominated by Chardonnay, with intense green fruits, a fine structure, no sign at all of aging. With the wine this fresh it could probably age another 5–10 years.",Femme Brut,93,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Duval-Leroy
109212,US,"Just delicious, a fascinating counterpoint to the winery's '01 Brut Chardonnay, with which it was coreleased.

109214,Italy,"This is a genuine, powerful wine that fully embodies the fundamental aromatic tenets of Amarone: cherry, chocolate and spice.

109217,US,"This has rich tannins, dense fruit and overall deep flavors. This is a dark wine, just this side of brooding, with ripe blueberry and cherry fruit, softly chalky tannins, whiffs of smoke and splashes of pepper. The dark fruit flavors are bold and seamless, melded with smoke and chocolate, dotted with ground espresso, and finished with a nice lift.

109219,US,"Production was 10,000 cases, amazing when you consider how good this mountain wine is.

109223,US,"This is just about perfect Sémillon— the gorgeous fruit has more flesh and breadth with flavors suggesting ripe fig, melon and citrus.

Most of the rest is Merlot—a Right Bank style. The concept works. It captures the sleek minerality of the site, and puts the fruit into tight, laser-like focus.

109235,US,"Bob Cabral's Chardonnays sometimes get lost in the brilliant glare of his Pinot Noirs, but he has spent years exploring the rich, flamboyant side of the variety, with great success. This bottling represents William Selyem Chardonnay at its best. It's ultra-decadent in apricot and pear flavors, with a strong oak influence, and yet an underlying minerality and fine acidity balance it so that it doesn't tire as you drink. In fact, you want more.",Heintz Vineyard,96,50.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
109236,US,"This is 100% varietal, from the Loess, Seven Hills, Pepper Bridge, and Mill Creek Upland vineyards. A deep, intense take on Merlot, it's so dark and concentrated that it dances on the )edge of bitterness, but in a style reminiscent of the finest Italian Merlots, that use that flavor to define and elucidate a dark and potent wine. In the mouth it fills out with luscious cherry and plum and blackberry fruit, baking chocolate, coconut and nougat.

109238,US,"Violets and compost dance through the aromas, leading into an intensely fruity palate loaded with sappy berry richness, nuanced with scents and streaks of cured meat, garrigue, earth and graphite. Blending 77% Syrah with 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, it strikes a perfect balance among fruit, earth, and rock.

Start with earth, seaweed, compost; bring in ripe berry fruit, vanilla, tobacco. That is the nose. In the mouth you get perfect fruit—bright, tangy, a mix of berries and cherries and cassis—highlighted with sharp, defining acidity and polished tannins.

109244,US,"A unique version of Andrew Will's Champoux, this is more than half Cabernet Franc, with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot filling in the rest. Thick and tannic, yet perfectly ripe and almost silky, it coats the palate with black cherry, graphite, slate and a bit of chalk.

109252,US,"Bring this bottle straight to the cellar. Don't even think about opening it before, say, 2013. All you'll get is a mouthful of hard, sandpapery tannins. But it's a very deeply flavored Cabernet, packed with massive blackberry, black currant, plum and cedar flavors, and there's a granitic minerality that must come from the soil. Very finely crafted.",Estate,94,125.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vineyard 7&8
109253,US,"DeLille's take on a first-growth Bordeaux Blanc really shines in this excellent vintage. Toasty and firm, it captures the lushness of the Sémillon fruit while mixing in bright citrus.

109312,Spain,"The excellent 2005 Azul is stout and secure, with a ripe, clean and modern bouquet that's backed up by a chewy, toasty flavor profile that pours on the black fruit and character.

109314,US,"Pure Red Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon fruit brings sexy flavors of wild berry and cassis.

109315,US,"This 100% varietal Merlot is a blend of three top Red Mountain vineyards: Klipsun, Ciel du Cheval and old vine Kiona.

109400,US,"This bottling, an extended lees Chardonnay, has been an innovation by the winery. The experiment is augmented by holding the release date back longer than usual. The 2006 vintage was not a great success, but this is an interesting, complex wine that should further develop in the bottle.

Inky black in color, it leads with a blast of toasty, mentholated oak on the nose, backed by waves of blueberries and mint.

It has the classic balance, complexity and flavors of that region, showing cherries, cola, rhubarb pie, pomegranates and spice, with a full-bodied dryness and long, ageworthy finish.

It's a fat, sweet, fleshy wine, instantly appealing for its delicious blackberry, blackstrap molasses, cherry, violet and sweet oak flavors, yet it's a cellar guarantee.

109440,Austria,"When Silvia Heinrich, Johann Heinrich's daughter (whose name is on this bottle) pushes the alcohol up to 14%, she somehow loses the intense varietal character.

109441,Austria,"For Johann Heinrich, this wine is a celebration of Blaufränkisch.

It's worth aging for 2–3 years.",Vitikult,88,24.0,Burgenland,,,Blaufränkisch,Johann Heinrich
109442,US,"What an easy-drinking Zin, and it has real complexity, too.

109456,Germany,"Light to medium in body, this is a clean, fresh auslese, not a big, sugary blockbuster. Pineapple and honey aromas lead the way, adding green apple, mint and citrus flavors as the wine crosses the palate. To some, it may seem a bit green and underripe despite the ample residual sugar, while to others it will a welcome respite from many of the overripe ausleses that are actually declassified BAs.",Valwiger Herrenberg Auslese,88,29.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Dr. Zenzen

109458,Argentina,"After you chop your way through the black forest of char, roasted berry and coffee aromas, you'll encounter a pretty large mass of flavors that include blackberry, cola, root beer and cinnamon. It's a fairly packed and saturated wine at 14.9%, and the finish of mocha and chocolate accentuates the wine's oak elevage. Best for those who like ripeness and size.

109464,Italy,"As far as Amarone goes, this version delivers general satisfaction and good quality but is also muddled by ripe flavors of strawberry comfiture, mushroom and wet soil that is probably due to overly mature fruit.

Another two or three years in the bottle will really bring this into focus.",JV Estate,90,25.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Stoller
109472,US,"Great entry, soft and seductive, with cherry and chocolate, but it dies quickly, fading into a delicate malted milk flavor. Re-tasted after being open for several hours, it had gained a little flesh, retained the milk chocolate flavors, but still seemed to need more bottle age to soften up the finish.",Estate Cuvée,90,50.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Sokol Blosser
109473,US,"The Goosepen bottling is distinctive, elegant and spicy, with a mix of baking spices, soft fruits, chocolate, coconut and butter. Certainly the barrel program is a success, but it supports pretty fruit flavors of blackberry and sweet plum, and the tannins are soft and seductive. A very pretty, approachable wine.",Goosepen Block,90,60.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Sokol Blosser
109474,US,"An easy to drink Pinot for its dryness, exceptionally low alcohol, and cleansing acidity. It has cherry, red plum, cola and herb flavors, framed with sweet, smoky sandalwood. Decant for a while.",Sterling Family Vineyard,90,32.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Old World
109475,Austria,"Aromas of peach and mango waft from the glass. This is a rich wine, although dry, with a smooth, almost oily texture. Its ripe fruit is intense, with the yellow fruit flavors dominating acidity and pepper. It could age for several years.",Von Stein Reserve,90,55.0,Kremstal,,,Grüner Veltliner,Salomon-Undhof
109476,Germany,"Classic Mosel nose of fresh blossoms, delicate stone fruit, slate and hints of flint.

109479,US,"Like the winery's “Fuller” Pinot Noir, this special, limited-edition offering honors some Oregon wine industry stalwarts, the owners of Elton Vineyards. It clearly reflects the flavors of the Eola-Amity Hills AVA—no tricks or attempts to hide the natural earthy, herbal character. Herb and sassafras, pine needle and sour cherry, spice and even a hint of pickle barrel (American oak?) mingle pleasantly, and the alcohol remains at a comfortable 13.3%.",O'Brien,90,100.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley Vineyards
109480,Germany,"Mid-gold color. Pronounced aromas of ripe yellow fruits, honey, with hints of warm earth, savory fresh root vegetables and spice. Sweet, richly textured, but refreshingly crisp.

109482,Germany,"Sweet, verging on honeyed, this lush wine features plenty of superripe apples balanced by just a dash of citrus and a hint of bitterness on the finish. Could use more complexity.",Wehlener Sonnenuhr Auslese,89,40.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler
109483,Italy,"This is a particularly well-balanced edition of Benuara (a 70-30 blend of Nero d'Avola and Syrah) that boasts a very nice quality and integrity of fruit followed by fresh aromas of blackberry, cherry and a shading of exotic spice. The low price will also win you over.",Benuara,89,16.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Red Blend,Cusumano
109484,US,"Very soft and smooth—like a Michel Rolland version of a Pinot Noir. The berry/cherry flavors are velvety and clean, the tannins supple, the palate seamless. The tang to the finish, showing some unintegrated acids, is the only jarring note.",Estate Selection,89,36.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Erath
109485,Argentina,"Dark and heavily oaked on first blush, but give it time to unwind or let it sit in the bottle for a year or two and this will satisfy any Malbec lover. Early on, it's dense and full of shoe polish, mint and coconut; later it spreads out to show sweet dark-berry flavors and finally a rich, almost sticky finish of woodspice, brown sugar and lushness.",Reserva,89,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Domaine Jean Bousquet
109486,South Africa,"This is a gorgeous Sauvignon Blanc with notes of sweet pea, honeydew, gooseberry and lemon rind citrus. Medium weight with assertive acidity and a vibrant, mouth-watering finish. Try with lemon roasted chicken or grilled swordfish.",,89,20.0,Western Cape,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Ataraxia

109488,US,"A lovely dessert wine in almost every respect. It's crisp in acidity and has complex, somewhat oxidized or Madeira-like flavors of oranges, tapioca and vanilla.

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Debit,Gypsy Canyon
109489,US,"Beautiful, classic blackberry and currant fruit in this polished Cabernet, along with a rich, tasteful coat of sweet oak. The tannins are thick but refined.

109490,Germany,"Pale gold color wine, with attractive floral nose hints, honey, slate and some obvious sulfur. Racy with a crisp juicy texture, lemony and moderately taut.

Reasonably long length.",Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Spätlese,89,20.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Joh. Haart
109491,US,"Searing acidity marks this wine, which tastes like it has a lot of Edna Valley fruit in the blend. It also shows bright, strong, long hangtime flavors of limes and pineapples. It's actually quite a fine Chardonnay, dry and low in alcohol. A great value at this price.",,89,15.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Bishop's Peak
109492,US,"Marked by dryness and some heat from alcohol, this wine also has a rich core of ripe cherries. It's very strong and powerful, not a Zinfandel that's shy or apologizes for its brashness. But that's the essence of Rockpile. Drink this sturdy wine now, and the ideal food pairing is barbecue.",Rocky Reserve Florence Vineyard,89,33.0,California,Rockpile,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Carol Shelton
109493,US,"This is a very rich Chardonnay, almost too elaborated and overworked. It's tremendous in oak-infused fruit, with dominating buttered toast, crème brûlée and pineapple pie flavors.

109498,Germany,"Pale gold color. Broad and aromatic, showing ripe yellow peach and nectarine, hints of honey, dried herbs and an earthy minerality.

109499,Germany,"Slightly closed at first, but slowly opens to reveal ripe stone fruits, hints of white flowers and an earthy minerality.

Moderately long, juicy finish.",Trocken,89,25.0,Rheinhessen,,,Riesling,Wittmann
109500,US,"An absolutely beautiful, first-class Cabernet that drinks really well now, and has the balance to ride out quite a few years in the cellar. Marked by near-perfect balance, it has ripe, sweet tannins and just enough acidity to lift the complex flavors of blackberries, blackcurrrants, anise and smoky cedar. This is a really great restaurant wine.",Estate Bottled,94,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tudal
109501,US,"An absolutely delicious Pinot Noir. Hard to exaggerate the drinkability factor. Supremely ripe cherry and raspberry fruit is highlighted by brilliantly crisp acidity to make it all bright and lively. Oak plays second fiddle, contributing rich, tasteful notes of smoke, vanilla and buttered cinnamon toast. Just gorgeous for drinking now and for the next 5–6 years with your best fare.",Cedar Lane Vineyard,94,35.0,California,Arroyo Seco,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Mercy
109502,US,"A beautiful, lush Chardonnay, made in the ripe California style.

109505,US,"This Two Blondes is the best ever—powerful and ripe, with a plush mix of raspberry and strawberry fruit, tart and tangy and mouthfilling. This wine has a huge midpalate, but doesn't stop there; as it slowly winds through a full-throttle finish, threads of chocolate, coconut, caramel and coffee appear. The flavors go on for several minutes.",Two Blondes Vineyard Red Wine,94,46.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Andrew Will
109506,Portugal,"Inky black in color, this is the top wine from Apegadas, a big, chunky wine that is characterized by dark tannins, bold berry fruits, sweet plums, but also a serious, more austere character to allow it to age. The final fruit is richly juicy. Age 3–4 years.",Grande Reserva,94,,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Apegadas Quinta Velha
109507,Spain,"Another winner from Emilio Moro. The nose is a touch minty and very spicy, but the black fruit element is there and overall the bouquet sings of integration.

109508,US,"Quite a distinguished Cabernet. Shows its pedigree in ultra-refined tannins and an overall mouthfeel of lushness and finesse.

Thirty-five dollars isn't cheap, but this is as good as it gets in this price bracket.",,94,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Crossbarn by Paul Hobbs
109509,France,"The name of the wine, the Romans, reminds us that Sancerre was once a Roman hilltop stronghold.

109513,US,"Buty's Right Bank-ish Merlot/Cab Franc is wild and slightly brambly, with dark streaks of iron and pencil lead, moist earth and herb.

109514,US,"At first blush this reserve seems more oaky, more open and more overtly alcoholic than the just-released Leonetti 2008 Merlot and 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon.

109515,US,"Nothing small about this Pinot Noir. It's almost as good as the 2007, which was terrific. Dry and elegant, it shows massively concentrated cherry, raspberry and cola flavors, with a rich coating of smoky sandalwood.

109550,US,"In the blend of this intensely fragrant young wine is 14% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot. I like the complexity, the way the primary fruits mix in unusual notes of pineapple along with the black cherry. It's resonant and tangy, with good, long flavors and lots of new oak. This was a year of winemaker transition, and may be the last of the real chocolaty wines from Northstar. Give this plenty of airing, or cellar it for another 3–4 years.",,92,41.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Northstar
109551,France,"As it ages in bottle, this Champagne is showing real class. It remains as delicate as when reviewed last year, but it is now showing much more mature toastiness and bread flavors, and less of the green fruits. Elegance is still the main character; a fine, pure wine.",Cuvée Louise Brut,92,185.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Pommery
109552,Canada,"Many Okanagan wineries turn out respectable Gewürz, but this one has more precision, focus and complexity than the rest, with a detailed mix of citrus and apple fruits, immaculately set against bracing acids. There is some sweetness, which serves to pump up the midpalate, but the acids rule.",,92,18.0,British Columbia,Okanagan Valley,,Gewürztraminer,Quails' Gate
109553,France,"This is certainly rich, packed with youthful green- and white-fruit flavors, but it still has that seductive elegance that is the hallmark of Deutz.

109554,US,"This is the first Pinot from the Napa house of Pahlmeyer, the result of many years of effort in his vineyard in the Fort Ross area of the true Sonoma Coast. The result is rich in cherry pie, raspberry liqueur, cotton candy, licorice, vanilla and cinnamon flavors that captivate from sip one, but there's a certain young vine simple directness that limits the score. As the vines age, the wine is one to watch.",,92,65.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Jayson
109555,US,"This is pure Cabernet from older vines, and has a meaty, herbal power to it. Streaks of tar and some lively cinnamon spice add life to the fruit, which is solid and earthy. I pick up black licorice, vanilla cream, and still more interesting flavors wrapped into the tannins, which seem dusty and smoky and a bit grainy. This has some real substance to it, and shows some of the herbal side of the grape. The best so far from SYZYGY.",,92,32.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Syzygy
109556,Italy,"If you love Italy and love elegantly oaked Chardonnay, this is your wine. Deep gold in color, Elena Walch delivers generous notes of apple, nut, spring flowers over lavish honey aromas.

109558,US,"Probably the most expensive unoaked Chard out there, this is a stunning wine, showing the laserlike purity and bright acids that this northwestern part of the Highlands coaxes from the grapes.

109559,US,"This Pinot shows the ripeness and richness that Testarossa is known for. Grape yields were evidently low, to judge by the concentration of cherries, raspberries, blackberries, cola, root beer and pomegranate flavors. Fully dry, the wine also is somewhat tight in tannins and acids. It should benefit from a few years in the cellar.",Brosseau Vineyard,92,54.0,California,Chalone,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
109560,Italy,"Here is a luscious and generous white wine from northeast Italy with a slightly more saturated color and golden highlights.

109564,Chile,"Aromas of sweet berry fruit and cherry lean toward medicinal. The palate is juicy due to bold acidity, and the flavors settle on main street cherry.

109565,US,"Solid and varietal, this puts the fruit up front, a substantial, mouthfilling plum and black cherry combo.

109567,US,"A mélange of sweet and spicy berries—like delicious pastry—is front and center here.

109570,US,"With very slight oak, but aged on the lees, this Sauvignon Blanc has richness that outshines the underlying fruit, which suggests lemons and limes.

109571,US,"This semi-dry Riesling is a classic, with a gorgeous lime cordial and petroleum nose topped off by delicate notes of white flowers.

109582,US,"The pedigree of this 100% Cabernet shows in the finely crafted tannins that are rich and voluptuous, and in the ripe blackberry and cherry fruit, which marries so well with sweetly caramelized oak.

109586,US,"Blueberry and red currant fruit flavors, augmented with streaks of gravel and pencil lead, give this Malbec a firm spine.

109594,US,"The Camille is a Merlot-centric Bordeaux blend, dense, liquorous, smoky, and loaded with chocolaty goodness—a truffle in a bottle.

109602,US,"The outstanding Elerding vineyard provided the fruit in 2006.

109605,US,"This is a pure Cab Franc, stylish and varietal. The new oak was limited to just 30%, giving a kick to the natural toastiness of the grape.

The tannins have been beautifully managed.",,90,32.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Franc,Hard Row To Hoe
109606,US,"Very rich and full-bodied, very voluptuous, this soft wine shows massive tiers of well-ripened black currant, plum sauce, mocha and cedar flavors.

109607,Italy,"There's a soft, creamy quality to this Sauvignon (with 10% barrel-fermented Picolit added to the blend) that recalls aromas of peach, passion fruit and papaya.

109613,US,"Tastes immature now, with the toasty oak not yet integrated, and the tannins also stick out in all their sticky glory.

Better sometime after mid-2010.",,90,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Phelan Vineyard
109614,Spain,"Full and boisterous red wine, with a ton of natural ripeness and a high pleasure quotient. We have always liked the Abadal wines, and this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend gets both sides of the Old World/New World argument right.

109615,Australia,"In an unusual twist, Yalumba's m/g/s gives Mourvèdre preeminence in the blend (60%), followed by 22% Grenache and 18% Shiraz. The result is a wine that lightens some of Mourvèdre's dark fruit and tree-bark tendencies with a dash of raspberries. The wine's alcohol level is restrained (13.5%), while still being ripe and round in the mouth yet finishing with some grip. Should age well, but there's no need.",Hand Picked m/g/s,90,30.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Yalumba
109616,Argentina,"Immediately this one shines. The nose offers deep bacon, crusty mineral and hefty, perfectly ripe dark-fruit aromas.

Ready to drink now.",Corte B,90,27.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Vistalba
109617,US,"This is essentially a mirror image of the 2004 Donedei Merlot. It brings the same dark, smoky, espresso-loaded scents and flavors, but it is sleeker, the acid more apparent (though actually a bit lower) and the tannins left to hang in the finish.

109618,Germany,"At 9.5% alcohol and with plenty of residual sugar, this is rather broad, but it still boasts excellent intensity and complexity.

109625,US,"Not one of the best Cabs from this venerable winery. Despite a cool vintage, there's a burnt edge to the blackberry pie filling flavors.

109627,Spain,"White raisin and touches of lettuce and celery give this multigrape blend some richness but also a bit of green character.

109628,Spain,"Matchstick, mushroom and licorice nib aromas add character to this fading but textured wine that struggles to offer peach and nectarine flavors.

109629,US,"With a honeyed edge of sweetness to the pineapple and lime flavors, this wine also has a zesty acidity that makes it finish with mouthwatering cleanness.

109634,Spain,"Dry black cherry and berry fruit shows some early chemical accents, and the wine stays sort of thin and hard all the way to the end. It's peppery and tight, with a simple dark-fruit personality. A little awkward at 14.5%.",Crianza,84,16.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Barzagoso

109636,US,"At first pass, this feels a little tired, with a somewhat feeble nose and flavors that could tend toward bitter.

109669,US,"This is warm and loose, with fruit that is very ripe and just on the verge of pruney. The ripe fruit flavors seem to soften the tannins, which are also quite ripe and smooth.

109673,US,"The blend here is the classic Bordeaux mix. It's a difficult vintage,  and this wine hits a wall of disjointed, chalky acid about midway through.

109720,US,"All the parts aren't even close to coming together yet on this immature Cabernet. You have strong, dusty tannins, prickly acids, lots of toasty new French oak, and fine cherry and blackberry fruit. All they need is six to 12 years to figure out how to get along with each other. When they do, the wine should be a beauty.",Reserve,92,95.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clos du Val
109721,US,"This is a new winery for me, and it's produced quite an impressive wine. It's big, thick, mouth-filling, with creamy pineapple custard and spice flavors and a firm, acidic minerality that is clearly a function of terroir. Impresses not only for power but finesse.",Reserve,92,35.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Pendleton
109722,US,"With its Landslide bottling, Simi brings to the table an important, affordable single-vineyard Cabernet. It typically shows a beautiful balance of sweet, ripe fruit and firm tannins, backed by crisp acidity, and is big enough to handle considerable oak. Young and juicy, it's delicious now, and should develop through 2012.",Landslide Vineyard,92,33.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Simi
109723,US,"Rich as sin, the '04 Rockpile Zin got enormously ripe but has been fermented to dryness, at the cost of very high alcohol. The flavors are a wonder. It's all about chocolate, crème de cassis, anisette, and the most wonderfully rich, spicy buttery, toasty vanilla bean.",Rockpile Road Vineyard,92,35.0,California,Rockpile,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Rosenblum
109724,Australia,"Winemaker Roman Bratasuik calls Kangarilla “quite a warm spot,” and that character is evident in this wine's dark blackberry and plum flavors, soft, open-knit texture and warmth on the finish.

109725,US,"Owner Kenny Kahn reserves the “Best Barrel” designation for his best wine. This year it's a Malbec. Pours inky black, and explodes with blackberry pie filling, chocolate, plum sauce, licorice and cedar aromas. Drinks as powerfully rich as it smells, offering immense flavors and luxuriously smooth, velvety tannins. Very soft. Drink now through 2009 before the fruit fades.",Best Barrel,92,75.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Malbec,Blue Rock
109726,US,"Immensely ripe, just explosive in young Cabernet flavors, and wrapped in those Howell tannins that require extensive cellaring. The wine, nearly 100% Cab, is totally dry and very oaky, from 100% new, small French barrels. But it's easily big enough in black currant, cherry and cocoa flavors to handle all that wood.

109727,US,"Dark, ripe and tannic, it's an ager, but there's something about it now that's instantly appealing. It is a dry wine but with a honeyed sweetness and glyceriney richness. Oozes blackberry, lead pencil, currant, cedar and mocha flavors leading to a long, balanced finish.",Reserve,92,70.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frank Family
109728,US,"This is a very fine Cabernet Sauvignon-based wine. It's immense in extracted black currant and chocolate flavors that are framed in soft, luxurious tannins. Acidity is soft, too, but adequate. The overall impression is of high quality. Despite the mountain origin, it doesn't seem like an ager, though, so drink now through 2009.",Elivette Reserve,92,90.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Blend,Spring Mountain Vineyard
109729,US,"There aren't a lot of wines coming off this appellation, and most of them are red. But this is a wonderful Chard. Ripe and detailed, it combines tropical fruit, mineral and oak flavors, and is dry and tart in acids.

109730,US,"The vineyard is in the Green Valley, and the acidity is very high, giving a bright purity to the kiwi, Key lime pie, pineapple custard and crème brûlée flavors.

109731,US,"Juslyn's top wine is just under the legal limit to call it Cabernet Sauvignon. It's surprisingly soft and accessible for a Spring Mountain Cab, offering immediate pleasure with its juicy, upfront blackberry liqueur and cocoa flavors. It's certainly a complex, balanced, elegant wine, and quite drinkable now. But it should hold and even improve for a decade.",Estate Red Wine,92,90.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Blend,Juslyn Vineyards
109732,Australia,"It's nice to know that some Australian wineries and importers have kept a lid on prices. Reilly's 2003 Old Bushvine is a 75-25 blend that showcases Grenache's soft, caressing texture.

Drink now.",Old Bushvine,92,17.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Grenache-Shiraz,Reilly's
109733,US,"Shows all the hallmarks of great Mondavi Reserve. Ageworthy and complex, with enormously ripe, rich fruit, classic chocolate, cassis plus cream and spice from new oak.

109735,US,"Plenty of richness here, mangoes, pineapple custard, Key lime pie, not to mention smoky, caramelly, butterscotchy oak, but there's also a streamlined, sleek minerality that leaves a lip-smacking steely feeling behind. Part of that is acidity. Really fine wine.",Bien Nacido Vineyard,92,28.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Steele
109736,US,"Here's a young Cabernet that's rich in complex, sweet tannins. The fruit shows all the hallmarks of the vintage, wonderfully ripe in blackberry, cherry, blueberry and chocolate flavors with an extravagant coating of toasty new oak. It's awfully good now, and should be opened by 2010 or so because of the softness.",Bell Mountain Vineyard,92,42.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Medlock Ames
109737,US,"The winery's Calistoga Cabernet is lush and opulent. This one is much firmer in acids and tannins, a more structured wine, although equally oaky, but it needs cellaring to show its best.

Alberto,91,38.0,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Malbec,Bodega Noemía de Patagonia
109740,Italy,"Started in the Soave region, this producer bought vineyards in Valpolicella to include hearty reds in its portfolio. In some distant way, those white winemaking techniques seem to be behind this Amarone. Its aromas are floral and soapy—wild rose and lavender—and very fragrant with undertones of scented candle or incense. The tannins are firm and the finish is long.",,88,55.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Ca' Rugate

109744,US,"A silky, delicate, almost lightweight Pinot Noir, this is a pretty wine, the antithesis of full-bodied and lusty.

109745,Austria,"Thermenregion, just west of Vienna, is getting a reputation for its international varietal red wines.

109748,US,"Like many of Jess Jackson's high mountain Cabs, this is extremely tannic and dry, at least by Napa standards. So is it ageable? Probably, given the rich heart of blackberry, cherry, violet flower and coffee flavors. But it's a new brand, unproven. Give it until 2009, then try again.",,88,40.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pelton House

Nice with a grilled steak.",Gregory Vineyard,88,36.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,VJB
109750,Argentina,"A good effort by Cavas Weinert. The wine is starting to mature, and along the road you get ripe berry aromas that broaden and improve with time. The plum, blackberry and red apple flavors are right, as is the tannin-to-acid balance. The only complaint is a mild chemical-paint thinner note at the base of the bouquet.",,88,23.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Weinert

Drink now.",Estate,87,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Girard
109755,US,"There's a minerality to this pleasantly dry Chard, a stony tang that dominates, although you'll find pineapple underpinnings. It's a leaner, more elegant style, and the winemaker has tried to enrich it with oak, sur lie aging and 50% malolactic fermentation.",Fiorella,87,36.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
109756,US,"This is a new, reserve-style wine from veteran Ferrari-Carano. It shows its cool-climate origins in the brisk acidity that boosts well-ripened pineapple tart, green apple sauce, and Key lime pie flavors. It's also extremely oaky, and would be a better wine if it had less barrel influence.",Tré Terre,87,36.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Ferrari-Carano
109757,US,"I found the winery's regular '04 disappointing. This commemorative bottling is oakier and much riper in tropical fruit flavors, with non-malolactic crisp acidity and a buttercream texture.

109775,Argentina,"Woody and smelling of sawdust early, this four-grape blend eases toward roasted berry, cassis, herbal plum and molten chocolate.

Big, fiery, saucy and lusty, but short on refinement and elegance.",Atemporal,89,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Alta Vista
109776,US,"A challenging wine. It's rather strong and dry and extracted now, lacking delicacy, and makes you want to stick it in the cellar for a while.

109791,South Africa,"Strong aromas of cassis, cocoa nibs, fresh mint sprigs, black currant leaf and licorice are the first things you experience with this wine.

109794,South Africa,"With 16 months in French and American oak, it should not be a surprise that this wine is as rich and wonderfully wood-spiced as it is.

Try in 2012.",Art Series,90,35.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Shiraz,Leeuwin Estate
109873,Italy,"We are extremely pleased with this vintage of Confini. The wine (a blend of Pinot Grigio, Traminer and Riesling) offers enormous aromatic intensity with layers of passion fruit, peach and citrus. Yet, this wine does not play all its cards on the nose. The texture it imparts in the mouth is smooth, creamy, rich and decadent overall.",Confini,90,45.0,Northeastern Italy,Venezia Giulia,,White Blend,Lis Neris
109874,Italy,"This is a gorgeous blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon, Moscato Giallo and Picolit (each undergoes a separate fermentation) with complexity and intensity.

109876,Germany,"A creamy-textured, medium-bodied kabinett, Haart's 2007 features some leesy complexity upfront, then focused pineapple fruit on the midpalate.

109877,Australia,"This soft, creamy-textured Shiraz features slightly lifted and peppery aromas and a suggestion of mint, then subdued flavors of cola, olive, earth and spice. It could use more obvious, expressive fruit, but there's no doubt this delicious wine shows complexity and elegance to spare. Drink now–2015.",,90,30.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Murray Street
109878,Portugal,"Coming from the Alvarinho region of Monção in the far north of Portugal, this is a rich wine, its creamy apple character brought out beautifully by its tight, steely edge. This has style, ripe fruit, a green plum skin edge to it, finished with vibrant acidity.",Portal do Fidalgo,90,16.0,Vinho Verde,,,Alvarinho,Provam
109879,Portugal,"A blend of Alvarinho and Trajadura, this is relatively full-bodied Vinho Verde. The creamy texture is the most apparent, always freshened with lively citric acidity, a very light prickle on the mouth. The wine is fragrant and crisp. Drink this summer, but also possible to age.",Varanda do Conde,90,12.0,Vinho Verde,,,Portuguese White,Provam
109880,US,"A terrific Chardonnay. You won't miss the oak at all. Offers a wealth of pineapple pie, Meyer lemon sorbet, green apple jam and vanilla flavors, brightened by clean, crisp coastal acidity.

109881,US,"What a great Syrah for twenty bucks. It's as dry, full-bodied and peppery as a fine Northern Rhône bottling, with impressively deep flavors of sour black cherries, plums, violets and cedar. An outstandingly good buy, but only 174 cases produced.",Wolff Vineyards,90,20.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,TreViti
109882,Australia,"Vasse Felix's 2005 Shiraz offers up a powerful, pungent blend of stewed fruit, cedar and dried spices, resulting in a wine that impresses more for its power and intensity than its elegance. It's the right match now with a grilled steak, but should mellow and become more civilized by 2012.",,90,30.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Shiraz,Vasse Felix
109883,US,"This may be the only Oakville-appellated Sangiovese, and it's quite a good wine.

An elegant wine to have with roasts.",Penny Lane Vineyard,90,32.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Sangiovese,Venge

Pleasant, warm and long on the finish.",Carrascal,90,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Weinert
109885,US,"This has appealing earthiness, and it's slightly chalky, with chocolaty tannins. Very dry red fruits suggest raspberry, pomegranate and cranberry.

109889,Portugal,"A rich wine, spiced with wood, tannins and sweet, ripe, black plums. The tannins give a granite, mineral edge of dryness, a core of strength in this impressive, structured wine. Wait another year for the black fruits to show through even more strongly.",,90,,Dão,,,Portuguese Red,Alvaro Castro
109890,Chile,"A nice wine with lean, agile citrus aromas that suggest grapefruit and passionfruit.

109893,Chile,"A recommended Chardonnay that's a step or two up from this country's norm. Vanilla, toast and apple aromas set the stage for lively apple, peach and melon flavors.

109894,France,"“Les Faisses,” meaning “terraces” in Occitan, refers to the vineyards overlooking the Heurault from which this wine was sourced. 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah, this is a vibrant, fruit-forward wine with ripe fruit characteristics of blueberry, raspberry and cherry along with accents of garrigue herbs and soft pepper.

109897,Chile,"Dark, smoky and loaded with olive, berry, earth and leather notes. The palate is dense and packs punch, with spiky tannins supporting boysenberry and spice flavors.

109898,US,"A nice, full-bodied Cabernet with some fancy features. It's a bit tight and tannic now, with the ripe blackberry fruit unintegrated with the 40% new oak, but a few hours of decanting should help. Contains all five Bordeaux varieties, which adds complexity.",Limited Release,87,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Conn Creek

109903,US,"An interesting blend, including significant amounts of Malbec, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon.

It tastes like a wine that was intended to be more expensive.",,87,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Boomtown
109904,France,"Delicious and inviting with notes of eucalyptus, chocolate-covered cherries and wild raspberries on the nose.

Made mainly with Monterey and Santa Barbara fruit.",Vintner's Reserve,87,18.0,California,California,California Other,Pinot Noir,Kendall-Jackson
109906,Italy,"This is a terrific wine with an attractively low price. Aromas include vibrant red fruit, forest berry and light shadings of Christmas spice.

109907,Argentina,"Floral fruit aromas are neither heavy nor concentrated, but they are a touch medicinal and chocolaty. Flavors of clove, cherry, plum and oak are racy, while the finish is a bit resiny and weighted down by vanilla. Good wine for the price.",,87,12.0,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,Ombu
109908,US,"Very dense and layered in grilled cherry, raspberry, cocoa, spice and cola flavors, this full-bodied wine needs rich barbecues and stews to tame its bigtime tannins.

109910,US,"Kind of clunky now. Bigtime tannins make it astringent, and the fruit flavors, of blackberries and sour cherry candy coated with oak, feel ripely heavy on the palate. Yet it's a clean wine, and could surprise down the road. Try after 2012.",Perspective,87,80.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tres Sabores

109912,US,"Vigorous and tannic, this young Pinot is hard right now. It also seems a little unbalanced, with some raisins and mint bracketing the cherries. Could just be going through an awkward youth. Try in 2011.",Graham Family Vineyard,87,54.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
109913,US,"A very pleasant, if a bit too young, Pinot Noir from this up-and-coming winery. Shows very ripe, smoky flavors of cherries, black raspberries, cola and sandalwood that are deep and last long into a spicy finish. Give it until late 2010 to knit together.",Hein Vineyard,87,44.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Rockroom Winemaking Cooperative
109914,Argentina,"A major-league oakster, with oily popcorn and baked apple aromas.

109916,US,"This is a very dry, tannic wine whose mouthfeel is too tough and astringent to enjoy now. It has lovely flavors of blueberries, blackberries, sweetly old leather, cola and peppery spices.

109917,Chile,"Dark and meaty on the nose, with plum, blackberry and spice notes. The palate is fleshy but a little hollow in the middle, with dark fruit that's tasty but not real deep or complicated.

109923,Spain,"A bit too much new American oak was thrown at this crianza, leaving minty, drying aromas that veer into the butter and dill range.

109924,US,"A soft, feminine nose of toasted oak and round fruit on the nose, and a flavor profile of balanced fruit and acid on the palate, make this a good white for both cold weather, serious meals and just sipping on the patio in warmer months. The mouthfeel is a touch light and the wine could use some weight, but overall, a good choice for numerous dishes.",Reserve,84,15.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay,Fox Run
109925,US,"This is Syrah. It has a classic Napa structure, with finely meshed tannins and soft acids, and has been treated with sweet, smoky oak.

109927,Spain,"Fiery, hot aromas feature raspberry, burnt leaves, balsamic notes and earth.

109930,Spain,"Fresh peach and nectarine dominate the nose on this semisweet blend of Viura and Malvasia. The flavors are mostly melon and citrus, while the finishing touch is that of fruit cocktail.

109934,Spain,"Aromatic notes of talcum powder and scented candles give this Bordeaux blend from Navarra a light, pleasant bouquet. But the palate is more starching and hard than ideal, leaving a spiky, jagged feel to the wine's raspberry and plum fruit. So rugged and jarring that food is downright mandatory. Ripped but punishing.",Ars Mácula,84,25.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Tandem

109936,US,"Even at six-plus years, and despite its origin in superstar grower's Beckstoffer's vineyards, this Cab has an imbalanced sweetness.

109940,US,"A spicy but subtle nose of cigar spice and red berry lead into a spirited character of more spice and medium body on the palate. Though the wine has heft, it need more strength in the midpalate and has an overall tartness that could deter.

109941,Spain,"Rueda is best when it's fresh and dancing, but this 2006 is showing too many signs of the hot year from which it came.

Polished and refined, this Cab should open gracefully over the next 15 years.",,91,60.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Slaughterhouse Cellars
110046,Australia,"Barossa fans should be seeking out the well-priced offerings from Ross Estate. This Grenache, from vines more than 80 years old, starts off with dark notes of coffee and plum, then gradually reveals dried cherries accented by hints of spice. The texture is creamy and lush, the finish mouthwatering and long. Drink now–2012.",Old Vine,91,20.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Grenache,Ross Estate
110047,US,"Nice and ripe in black cherry pie filling, black raspberry, cola, root beer and smoky oak flavors, this Pinot has some firm tannins that will stand up to a rich steak. It should hold through 2010.",Castelli-Knight Ranch Vineyard,91,36.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Armida
110048,US,"This is the first Monticello Syrah I've had, and it's a very impressive one. Grown in the cooler southern part of Napa Valley, it shows crisp acids and a peppery zest that make the blackberry, cherry and chocolate flavors extra enjoyable.",Estate Grown,91,34.0,California,Oak Knoll District,Napa,Syrah,Monticello Vineyards
110049,US,"This Cabernet-based blend has some pedigreed vineyard fruit in it, including Tokalon and Beckstoffer Georges III. It's extremely soft and complex, but not showing all that well at this moment. Seems a bit closed down, muted. But it's a very fine wine that probably needs time to open. Drink 2008–2010.",Perry's Blend,91,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Blend,Juslyn Vineyards
110050,US,"The grapes seem like they were picked earlier than others, making for a lean-style Pinot Noir that's high in acids and minerality. It's almost austere, although maybe “restrained” is a better word. Dry and tannic, but with a deep core of cherry compote fruit, the wine needs a little time. Should begin to blossom by 2007 and drink well through 2012.",Hailey's Block,91,55.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford
110051,Australia,"Ross Estate is only several years old, but winemaker Rod Chapman is a long-time veteran, and his North Ridge Shiraz is a knockout for the price. Dense aromas of fruitcake and spice ease out of the glass, while the flavors follow a similar trajectory—rich and a touch syrupy, with dried-fruit and spice notes that are distinctly Barossa. Finishes with a dusty, layered feel to its tannins, suggesting a drinking window of 2008–2015.",North Ridge,91,18.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Ross Estate
110052,US,"Very good Cab, creamy, dry and rich. The flavors are super-upfront, all blackberry and cherry pie, chocolate and charry vanilla oak, with cinnamon spice in the finish. It's a decadent wine, and fortunately has the crisp acidity and firm tannins for balance. Should be easy to find, with 19,000 cases. Best now–2012.",,91,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mount Veeder
110053,US,"This beautifully classic Napa Cab plays it straight down the middle, aiming for drinkability and complex ageworthiness.

110055,US,"Trentadue's La Storia bottlings are their reserves, and the designation is justified for this Zin. Soft and melted in texture, with succulent wild blackberry jam, milk chocolate and cherry flavors, it's very dry, with gentle tannins. There's a butterscotchy, vanilla richness on the finish that probably comes from charred oak.",La Storia,91,28.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Trentadue
110056,US,"Ripe, soft and polished, this is one of those Cabernets that feels fancy and upscale in the mouth. Mainly that comes from the quality of the tannins, which are refined and sweet, and the flavors, which are a combination of blackberry, ripe grapes and new oak. Probably at its best now and for the next five years.",Estate Grown,91,80.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hewitt
110057,US,"If you're a fan of big, oaky Chards, you'll like this one. It's rich and unctuous in ripe tropical fruit custard flavors, with the buttered toast, crème brûlée and smoky char that comes from new French barrels. But it has a perky acidity that lends it an appley, minerally note.",Floral Clone,91,28.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Godwin
110058,New Zealand,"More restrained on the nose than the regular Chardonnay, but with greater depth, richness and texture, the 2005 Casarina Reserve Chardonnay is a selection of older vines, mainly the Mendoza clone. Subtle popcorn and cereal-grain notes add elegance to the melon fruit, finishing with crisp acids that balance the wine's weight.",Casarina Reserve,91,30.0,Martinborough,,,Chardonnay,Te Kairanga
110059,US,"The youthful acidity really strikes you, and so do the silky texture and enormous flavors, all of which make it textbook Garys'. The raspberry parfait, sweet mint tea, and dusting of white chocolate are delicious, but the wine feels young and unresolved. It needs a little time to come together. Best 2007–2010.",Garys' Vineyard,91,54.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
110060,Australia,"Perennially one of Australia's best Merlots, the 2004 version “shows the cool season,” according to winemaker Roman Bratasiuk.

110062,US,"Really good Cab here, a blend of mountain and foothills fruit that captures Napa's elegant intensity. It's a fully dry, balanced wine, with hefty, sticky tannins yet an immediate approachability of blackberry and Chinese plum sauce flavors and a rich, chocolaty finish. Good now and over the next ten years.",,90,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ladera
110063,US,"The winery must have held this back this long to let the acidity soften, but it's still a crisp Chardonnay. A big one, too, packed with tropical fruit, roasted coconut, creamy lees, steely mineral and new oak flavors. Give it until 2007 to resolve itself.",Sleepy Hollow,90,42.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Talbott
110064,US,"Rodney Strong has vineyards across the county, from cool to warm, and winemaker Rick Sayre is a master blender. This is a terrific wine at this price.

110065,US,"At four-plus years, the wine is hanging in there, maintaining fruit and freshness and picking up some aged, dried pineapple and peach character. It's an interesting wine, picking up textural complexities, but needs to be drunk soon.",Reserve,90,28.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Mosaic
110066,US,"Made in a tight young style that requires cellaring, the wine opens with a minty, cigarette ash and char aroma, then turns much sweeter in the mouth. Ripe cherries, blackberries, cola and sweet spicy oak flavors dominate, leading to a tannic finish.

110068,US,"The vineyard is on benches between Rutherford and St. Helena. The wine is immaculate Cabernet in the modern style, soft and rich in blackberries and cherries that are so ripe, they veer into melted chocolate. This yumminess is complexed with smoky oak, and balanced with just enough dusty tannins to keep it all from collapsing.",Kronos Vineyard,90,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Corison
110069,New Zealand,"Shows all the intensity you could want from a New Zealand Merlot (there's just 7% Cab Franc and 1% Cab Sauvignon in the blend), but seems to be in a bit of an awkward stage right now. Back in June it showed great finesse and elegance to go with its power, but tasted again in September it seems chunkier, with some rough edges of wood and alcohol poking out.

110076,Greece,"Dried herbs, spicebox and cherry on the nose show this red means business. Masculine flavors of cigarbox, black fruit and vanilla give it a serious edge.

110125,US,"This is a perfect Petite Sirah to cellar. It defines the Napa ageworthy style, with its beautifully ripe but hard tannins, deeply ripe flavors and overall balance.

110204,US,"Plum and cherry notes struggle to show themselves under a heavy layer of coconut and sawdust from new American oak.

A year or two in the cellar will allow for better integration.",Optiumus,87,23.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Red Blend,Swedish Hill
110205,US,"This is a tough, dry wine that needs rich fare to balance it out. It's very tannic and sharp in acidity, with flavors of coffee, blackberries, dark unsweetened chocolate and spices. Should develop well for many years, gradually mellowing and sweetening.",,87,26.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Barbera,Unti
110206,US,"Give this young, fruity wine a few years in the cellar. The flavors are all primary blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam.

110207,Chile,"Opens with floral berry aromas and standard-issue black fruit notes. The palate has moderate weight and stickiness, while the flavors of cassis, berry and rubber are smoky.

110208,France,"A lovely blend from the Languedoc comprised of 60% Cabernet Franc, 30% Syrah and 10% Merlot.

110210,Chile,"Not sure what the difference is between this wine and Agustinos' Gran Reserva and Reserva Privada because all are priced the same and rate about the same.

Finishes with some honey and spice.",Reserva,87,13.0,Bío Bío Valley,,,Chardonnay,Agustinos
110211,France,"Starts off a touch funky, but that subsides after a couple of minutes in the glass.

110213,Argentina,"Aromas of violets, blackberry and black currant jam are solid, while the palate shows sharper acidity than most Bonardas, and thus a juicy sensation along with flavors of snappy black cherry and boysenberry. Fresh and forward, with a lot of fruit and potency.",Reserve,87,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Cruz Alta
110214,US,"Here's a pretty, polished Pinot for drinking now with a nice steak.

There's even a touch of barnyard.",Bella Luna Vineyard,87,45.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Churchill Cellars
110215,US,"Feels like a crisp, silky Sauvignon Blanc, with citrus, lemongrass and mineral flavors and brisk acidity, but much richer due to the addition of tangerines and butter-creamy peaches. A nice appetizer wine for things like mushroom-filled pastries, goat cheese and salumi plates.",,87,18.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Pinot Gris,Claiborne & Churchill
110216,US,"Here's a clean, sound wine that offers tons of Zinny character at a fair price.

110217,US,"With plenty of consumer-friendly vanilla/tobacco flavors, this value Cabernet also brings in dark fruits—blackberry and cassis.

A good everyday choice for that burger.",Grand Estates,87,11.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Cabernet Sauvignon,Columbia Crest
110218,US,"A fine Merlot that shows lots of class at a pretty good price. It's a little rough in texture, but not too much, with sophisticated black cherry, black currant and red plum flavors, made richer with a touch of violets and cedar wood. Give it a good decant before serving.",,87,18.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Highway 12
110219,France,"A soft wine, holding its freshest fruit back. At this stage, it is creamy and rich, hinting at yellow fruits, but still very reticent. Some sulphur remains on the palate but should blow away in the next few months.",,87,18.0,Loire Valley,Pouilly-Fumé,,Sauvignon Blanc,Gilles Blanchet
110220,US,"Grown in the Happy Canyon section of eastern Santa Ynez, an area that one of these days will be an official appellation.

110222,Spain,"Take the bubbles out of Cava and this is pretty much what's left. The nose is light, with peach and banana aromas.

110224,Spain,"Oily and citrusy, with pungent, almost nutty aromas that are at once exotic but simultaneously funky and sour.

110225,US,"With very high alcohol of 15.5%, this Grenache has a hot, peppery burn in the mouth, which is unfortunate, because otherwise, it's a beautiful wine.

110227,US,"A rush of zippy, fresh fruit and spice aromas recommends this white from New York, offering the kind of clean fruit flavors and minerality that makes this region unique. The wine lacks real complexity and tends toward the austere but the beguiling spice saves the day.",Ingle Vineyard,84,18.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay,Heron Hill
110228,US,"A deep golden color and classic Chardonnay fruit and spice aromas, albeit with a touch of sweetness, begin this wine. On the palate, the fruit is fresh and good but lacks the layering and grounding that oak should offer. Overall it's a good everyday wine that just needs a touch of class to round out the rough edges; food may be the key.",,84,12.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay,Hunt Country Vineyards

110232,US,"This Chardonnay is creamy and scented with vanilla, ripe apple and pineapple. The fruit has a slightly overripe quality, a suggestion of funk on the finish, and the vanilla seems artificial.

110238,US,"This Gewürztraminer-like wine is very acidic, with a prickly mouthfeel, but that's just fine given the right foods, like sausages or a rich paté. The spicy, peach and fig flavors could be more concentrated, though.",,84,18.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Traminer,Mosby
110239,US,"A little green, with mint flavors accompanying the modest blackberries and cherries. The wine is 100% varietal. Shows promise, but needs greater concentration, even if the price has to be higher.",The Heritage Collection,84,14.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Peirano
110240,US,"A subtle nose of butter and spice leads this wine whose flavors are varietally correct but not terribly inspired. The fruit is balanced and round but the finish slightly watery.

110242,US,"The official alcohol on this wine is 14.9%, but it has a syrupy concentration and heat that tastes far higher than that. Was it watered down?

110243,US,"This is a sharp, high-toned Cabernet, which begins with nail polishy aromas and some cherry candy flavors, then quickly tails off.

110247,US,"Martin & Weyrich continues to struggle with this difficult variety, just like everyone else who tries it in California.

110251,Spain,"There's no shortage of ripe aromas: leather, berries and aged cheese. Yet the palate is quite sharp, with searing acidity sitting on top of red-berry flavors.

110297,France,"90—92 Barrel sample. Named after the limestone, Astéries, which dominates this small vineyard. The wine is mineral, tannic, somewhat austere at this stage, with dry tannins.",Barrel sample,91,,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Les Astéries
110298,US,"Captures the robust, fruity essence of Petite Sirah, in a balanced, richly tannic and ageworthy package. It's completely dry, with complex waves of wild blueberries and blackberries, plums, mulberries, tobacco, leather, dark unsweetened chocolate and peppery spices. Good now, but will benefit from 6–10 years in the cellar.",,91,38.0,California,Rockpile,Sonoma,Petite Sirah,Keating
110299,US,"This is the first Stevens Cab Franc since 2001. It's dark and smoky, with an interesting mix of violets and plummy fruit. It carries the Stevens imprint of black fruits, licorice, clean earth, graphite and black olive—a stiff, tannic, tight wine with the structure to age for decades.",,91,27.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Franc,Stevens
110300,Austria,"With its ginger spice and lemon honey, this brings out both the nature of the Grüner and the intense sweetness of the botrytis. Lime marmalade flavors give richness, acidity gives balance. An impressive wine, for aging.",Beerenauslesel,91,60.0,Kamptal,,,Grüner Veltliner,Schloss Gobelsburg
110301,US,"A beautiful blush wine, both to look at and to drink. The color is “the partridge's eye,” and in the mouth, the wine is fully dry, crisp and subtle in raspberries, tangerines, vanilla, brioche and spices. Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.",Brut Rosé,91,41.0,California,North Coast,North Coast,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg
110302,Italy,"This is a subdued and elegant Barbaresco with a delicate delivery of aromas. You'll recognize Indian spice, cola, anise seed, black currant, licorice and vanilla seed. The mouthfeel is thick and masculine, on the other hand, and the wine closes with austerity and firmness.",Currá,91,70.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Sottimano
110303,US,"With a blast of smoky, sweet new oak and profoundly ripe flavors of blackberry essence and cassis, this single-vineyard wine is not particularly subtle, although it is dry and classically balanced. The suggestion is ageability, to let things calm down and mellow. It's a gamble, but this 100% Cabernet could be stunning after 2012.",Les Ivrettes Vineyard,91,60.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trivium
110304,US,"Does a good job at capturing Pinot's silky texture and the earthy, mushroomy notes that provide a grounding to the ripe red cherries and cola. Oak adds the perfect touch of smoky vanilla and spicy sandalwood. A lovely wine, and should develop nuance in the bottle through 2013.",,91,35.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Merryvale
110305,Austria,"This is impressive, both from its richness and alcohol (the narrow Krems River Valley is an oven in summer) and from its pure fruit and balance. The texture is smooth, with apricot, white peach, caramel and pepper. It never loses a sense of freshness, the acidity floating over the rich fruit flavors.",Ehrenfels vom Urgenstein,91,,Kamptal,,,Grüner Veltliner,Proidl
110306,US,"You want soft, gooey Chardonnay? Go someplace else. This is a steely, minerally, bracing wine whose high acidity makes your mouth water.

Very nice with shellfish and pasta in a cream sauce.",Bien Nacido Vineyard Steel Cut,91,32.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Foxen

110309,France,"90-92 Barrel sample. Spicy new wood opens a wine that is rather stretched, taut. The opulence of Merlot Pomerol is not there, but it has been replaced by a structured wine.

110311,Italy,"This is a hardworking producer with a recently refurbished winery and a new tonneaux regimen that seems to have suffered from the hot vintage.

110313,Italy,"This is difficult to score because its aromas dart off in opposite directions making it hard to discern the quality of the fruit. I picked up citrus notes, like pink grapefruit and lemon zest, on one side of the spectrum and heavy notes of tar, resin and asphalt on the other.

110317,Argentina,"A full and pulsing wine, with leather and other animal notes to make things more interesting.

A bit grabby and overexcited, but good with grilled meats.",Reserve,87,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Filus
110318,Argentina,"From San Rafael in southern Mendoza, this Cab Sauvignon picks up a little more steam and complexity every time you go back to it.

110320,Austria,"Somewhat rustic initially, then shows very pure red cherry flavors along with fresh acidity. The structure is light and fresh rather than tannic, leaning towards sweetness and ripeness. Not a wine for aging, but enjoyable now.",Rosenberg,87,29.0,Burgenland,,,Pinot Noir,Höpler
110321,US,"An inaugural vintage from an estate vineyard, and one to watch despite some structural weakness. Feels a bit rough and jagged around the edges, with a greenness to the tannins and acids.

110327,US,"The vineyard is on the Carneros border, and this Chard has lots of juicy acidity, which may also be due to the winemaker picking the grapes at a relatively low ripeness level.

110333,Argentina,"Jammy red-fruit aromas mixed with buttery oak make for a simple, sappy nose. There's more butter on the palate in addition to solid blackberry flavors.

110343,Argentina,"A lovely, crisp-styled Malbec (with 10% Merlot) that does the Río Negro region of Patagonia proud.

Firm on the finish, with a bit of a tart edge.",Aerope,90,102.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Grenache,Two Hands
110348,US,"The best thing about this wine is the acid-tannin balance. Sure, it's ripe in blackberry and blueberry jam and cocoa flavors, but so are plenty of other red wines.

110381,US,"You might want to lay this Syrah-based Rhône wine down for a year or two. Tasted in the early fall of 2010, it's sharp and fresh-fruity, which gives the cherry, raspberry and cocoa a jammy taste.

110387,Argentina,"Lively but also narrow on the nose. The feel is very fresh and juicy due to firm, bracing acidity that gives a tangy, lemony character to the wine's dark-fruit core.

110389,US,"Compiled from a half dozen vineyards scattered throughout the northern Willamette Valley. Firm, sculpted and dense, this has more grip and depth than might be expected at this price point.

All their reds are super-hard and astringent, almost old-fashioned in their undrinkabiity during youth, and so it is with this reserve.

However, it does have a few aces up its sleeve and this Grechetto-based wine (with fruit sourced from five different vineyards) is one of them.

110434,Italy,"Lovers of traditional Amarone can appreciate a pinch of volatility (it sometimes appears as apple or cider) because it can add vibrancy, buoyancy and life to a wine when applied in measured doses.

The style is ripe, but the dryness gives some opening austerity.",Tsarine Premier Cru Brut,90,54.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Chanoine
110460,Italy,"This is incredibly intense with aromas of candied fruit, pine nut, resin and honey. The mouthfeel is dense and persistent and ultimately this Verduzzo Friulano drinks more like a red wine than a white.",,90,37.0,Northeastern Italy,Venezia Giulia,,Verduzzo Friulano ,Bressan
110461,Portugal,"A firmly dry wine, driven by the dark tannins, only opening slowly to give ripe berry fruits. The soft side of the wine does bring out the lighter nature of the Baga in the blend, which has been tamed by wood aging. There is a final flourish of fresh black plum juice.",Quinta das Baceladas,90,26.0,Bairrada,,,Portuguese Red,Caves Aliança
110462,Italy,"This blend of Chardonnay, Friulano and Sauvignon offers a pretty golden color and oak-related aromas, which hold up very nicely to the wine's natural tones of mature peach, apricot and cantaloupe melon. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy and leaves a soft, supple impression. Very nice and sophisticated.",Broy,90,49.0,Northeastern Italy,Collio,,White Blend,Eugenio Collavini
110463,Italy,"A flagship blend of Sauvignon, Friulano and Pinot Bianco, Cicinis is a golden, saturated wine with rich density and intense aromas of orange blossom, citrus, chestnut and creamy vanilla.

110464,US,"The vineyard is on the cooler western edge of Paso Robles, and this bottling has been getting better over the years. The '07 is the best yet, a dry, crisp wine of richness and polish.

110465,US,"Swanky is a good word to describe this bone-dry, acidic blend of Viognier, Chenin Blanc, Muscat and Sauvignon Blanc. Something about it reminds you of a martini. It shows a swirl of citrus, peach, apple and wildflower flavors that are frankly delicious, a classic California white wine at an everyday price.",Swanky White,90,13.0,California,California,California Other,White Blend,Hey Mambo
110466,Italy,"Equal parts Chardonnay and Sauvignon, this beautiful white blend delivers intensity both in terms of structure and aroma. You'll get peach, fresh kiwi, passion and exotic fruits.

110467,US,"Backed up by a fine structure of tangy acidity and rich, ripe tannins, this Cab shows a fine complexity of flavor.

110468,Australia,"This is a rich, powerfully oaky Shiraz, but masses of fruit show through on the finish, offering hope for the future. Now, it will appeal to the same steakhouse crowds who love Silver Oak and Caymus, but in a year or two expect the oak to partially integrate and the wine to become more complete. Drink 2010–2015.",Show Reserve,90,30.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Shingleback
110469,US,"This is the least expensive of Barnett's new single-vineyard Pinots, but it's also the richest and tastiest. It's a luscious wine, filling the mouth with cherry, currant, cola, sassafras or root beer, vanilla and anise flavors, wrapped into a silky texture. Feels luxurious and fine. Drink now through 2013.",Tina Marie Vineyard,90,42.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Barnett
110470,US,"It's supple, lightly spicy and svelte—it has the sleekness of a fine racehorse, and runs across the palate at a confident gallop.

110471,Italy,"If you want to taste the true flavors of Northeast Italy, we recommend you try this wine. Biancosesto is a highly successful marriage of Friulano and Ribolla Gialla (two leading indigenous grapes) that delivers intense aromas of passion fruit, peach, honeysuckle, lemon zest and candied fruit. What sets it apart however is its soft, creamy texture.",Biancosesto,90,31.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,White Blend,La Tunella
110472,Australia,"This blend of 49% Grenache, 32% Shiraz and 19% Mataro is full and lush, loaded with brandied cherries and dressed up with touches of cinnamon and cedar.

110474,US,"A really nice Sauvignon Blanc. Fundamentally dry, but rich in fruity extract, it shows crisp, creamy flavors of pineapples, limes, sweet Meyer lemons, vanilla and smoky oak, girded by a firm minerality. Shows how well the cool Russian River Valley can treat this variety.",,90,26.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Ledson
110475,US,"A terrific wine whose slight residual sugar of 0.8% is balanced by crisp Monterey acidity that's so firm, the wine finishes dry.

110477,Australia,"Despite carrying a lot of alcohol (16% on the label), this powerful mix of mocha, caramel and stewed berries does a good job of hiding it. At first, it seems soft and creamy in texture, but it turns firmer, chewier and more serious on the finish, adding in a hint of espresso. Opt for drinking this over the near term with grilled beef.",,90,32.0,Victoria,Heathcote,,Shiraz,Eppalock Ridge
110478,US,"This is the first vintage for Cab Franc as a varietal wine from Gamache. A lot of blueberry and black cherry shows through, along with generous barrel flavors of smoke and toast.

110479,US,"A fine Pinot, with the lush, silky texture you expect from this variety. The flavors are rich, of sour cherries, red plums, red currants, herb tea, orange zest, cinnamon and pepper.

110480,Portugal,"Made jointly by Filipa Pato and her husband William, a blend of Encruzado from Dão and Bical from Bairrada, and cask fermented. It is a beautiful wine, dense, concentrated, rich and creamy, a mouthfilling wine with white figs, and a green plum skin texture.",Vinhos Nossa Branco,90,34.0,Beiras,,,Portuguese White,Filipa Pato
110481,Portugal,"Its dark color promises power, and this wine delivers a broad, chunky Shiraz, with perfumed fruit, dark tannins and a spicy wood structure. Solid concentration gives a wine that somehow manages to assimilate a Franco/Australian variety into a dry Portuguese structure.",Grand'Arte,90,11.0,Estremadura,,,Shiraz,DFJ Vinhos
110482,France,"Velvety texture with strong but not overly astringent tannins. A big, intense nose loaded with black raspberries, chocolate pudding and accents of menthol.

A complex and immensely satisfying selection for the price.",,90,19.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Coteaux du Languedoc,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine de Nizas
110483,Australia,"Because of its often formidable structure, d'Arenberg's The Dead Arm is a difficult wine to evaluate when young. The 2006 is dark and extracted, with intense cassis, coffee and chocolate notes but not much complexity or elegance. Those should come with time; the firmness of the lingering finish suggests cellaring through 2014.",The Dead Arm,90,65.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,D'Arenberg
110484,France,"Brooding and mysterious, this is a serious wine that deserves a serious steak to go with it.

110486,US,"The '06 was a 16% monster, but delicious. The '07 is just as good, but swings less of a hammer. Alcohol is 14.8%, yet the wine comes across as the concentrated essence of raspberries and cherries, lifted with all-natural acids, and showing a piercing core that just keeps on going.",Pheasant Vineyard,90,26.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Zinfandel,Trio Vintners
110487,Portugal,"You want big, bold flavors, plenty of spicy wood? It's all here inside the heavyweight bottle. In fact, the spice is the most dominant character, flavors of grated nutmeg going right over the dark, closed tannins and big, brooding fruit. Give it 2–3 years.",,90,29.0,Estremadura,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Boição
110488,Portugal,"The Dão's very own white variety, Encruzado gives a citric, bright lime and grapefruit wine, with a delicious bite of pear skin.

110489,Germany,"At 13.5% alcohol, this is pretty ripe Riesling, broad in the mouth and almost oily in texture. Hints of honey and ripe pear mark the nose, but this wine is more about minerally extract than fruit. Turns spicy on the mouthcoating finish.",Erbach Schlossberg Erstes Gewächs,90,40.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Schloss Reinhartshausen
110490,US,"Tight and acidic, with a sharpness that's a little cutting now, despite elaborate cherry pie filling, cola and red currant flavors. Could develop over the next few years, but it's a gamble.",Doctor's Vineyard,87,52.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,George IV
110491,France,"Bright and concentrated at the same time, with strong notes of black berries and cassis backed by softer notes of yellow flowers, almond skin, rosemary and pepper.

Very approachable; drink now.",Grand Terroir Tautavel,87,19.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Côtes du Roussillon Villages,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Gérard Bertrand
110492,US,"Though it's 80% Syrah, the rest of this wine includes all five Bordeaux grapes. It smells and tastes powerfully of new French oak, wrapped around sweet cherry and cola flavors. Cedary and chocolaty through the finish, it carries a suggestion of sweetness, though it's listed as bone dry.",WoodsLake,87,21.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Patterson
110493,US,"There's a good crunch of mouthwatering acidity on this wine, like biting into a green apple or slice of pineapple, both of whose flavors are here, along with gooseberries and a distinct taste of nutmeg. The wine is very dry. Creaminess adds needed richness, but it's still a tart wine.",Farina Vineyard,87,22.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Tres Sabores

110496,Argentina,"Big, meaty and dense, with dampness, earth and size. This is your typical deep and chewy wine, but the structure and core qualities are just above average. Flavors of black cherry, plum and brown sugar are good, while the finish shows a creamy vanilla flavor and cola. Good but not great for the price.",Gran,87,32.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Riglos
110497,US,"A bit heavy now, with lots of unintegrated parts. The new oak sticks out from the tannins, and the blackberry, blueberry and cherry fruit is all primary and jammy. If you drink now, decant, but this 100% Cab should be better after 2010.",,87,36.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,M by Martellotto
110498,Chile,"Tropical fruit and melony aromas give this wine a soft outlook. The palate is wet and refreshing but not pointed, with sweet, approachable flavors of mild grapefruit and lime.

110499,US,"Well-done in a very exuberant style, with blackberry jam and tar notes layered over animal scents and wood ash.

110500,US,The Lucas 2007 Limited Reserve Syrah shows the potential the Syrah grape has in upstate New York.

110502,US,"A good choice for fans of older wines, the Raphael 2002 Merlot shows mature forest floor and earth scents but is still hanging on to some raspberry and blackberry fruit. The crisp palate has a mouthwatering character and a touch of singed plum flavor. Woody tannins chime in on the medium finish. Drink before 2011.",Estate Bottled,87,25.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Merlot,Raphael
110503,US,"This is a reserved and elegant example, fashioned along European lines. There's mixed vegetable and tomato notes upfront and a juicy palate of red fruit rounded out by a vanilla top note.

110506,US,"Bold and brawny, the Palmer Merlot offers up convincing scents of mulberries and vanilla backed up by a palate that's both juicy and gripping.

110508,US,"Buena Vista has a good reputation for this bottling, and the great '07 vintage has resulted in another fine Chardonnay, at a good price.

110509,US,"Ripe and smooth, with polished cherry pie filling, red currant, cola and sweet oak flavors. The wine is fully dry and the tannins are brisk and astringent.

110511,US,"A little sharp in the mouth, with a bite of citrusy acidity, but the cherry, cola, pomegranate and sandalwood flavors are very rich, and the texture is silky.

110512,Argentina,"NQN's Picada 15 line is a consistent source for good value among red wines. This four-grape blend (led by Cabernet Sauvignon) has a slight aroma of burnt leaves and tire rubber, but it settles with air into a good whole.

110517,US,"Meritage wines must be Bordeaux blends; otherwise, they can be all over the map. This is an all-purpose, affordable red blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec.

110520,Spain,"Quite brambly and funky, with a roasted “country” quality that points it toward leather and rubber.

110528,US,"Except for a taste of cooked grapes, this is a pretty good Sangiovese. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with a nice earthiness behind the cherries.

110530,US,"Made from Chardonnay, Viognier and Chenin Blanc, this Mendocino-Lodi-Clarksburg blend is a little too sweet for comfort.

110634,Spain,"Purple in color, with a sweet, fragrant bouquet featuring mostly plum and strawberry but also a touch of rusticity.

110635,Greece,"Dark earth, graham cracker and plush purple fruit aromas introduce a wealth of blueberry and black plum flavors wrapped in oaky spice.

110636,Australia,"Like many McLaren Vale Shirazes, this one seems to fall somewhere between the full-blown Barossa style and the herb- and spice-driven styles of cooler climates. There's a minty edge to the blackberry fruit, espresso notes similar to those found in the northern Rhône, and firm tannins on the finish.

110638,US,"Seems made in a less ripe style, a minty, wintergreen wine with hints of barely ripened blackberries and some briary wild berries. Drinks bone dry and fairly tannic. If you're into an earthier, more French Bordeaux style, try this one. Will benefit from a decade of aging.",Tietjen Vineyard,89,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Elyse
110639,US,"Big, thick, soft, gooey, delicious, a little hot, that begins to describe this Rhône blend, which is Syrah, Grenache and a dash of Petite Sirah.

110645,US,"Many wineries have taken fruit from this vineyard, generally with good results. The '05 Lucas & Lewellen shows its terroir, with a cool-climate crispness backing up ripe pineapple tart, nectarine and papaya flavors.

110651,Argentina,"Smoke, rubber and a touch of herbs and leaves make this more traditional in style, meaning it offers Old World Bordeaux notes of earth, mineral and subdued fruit as opposed to ripe, jammy berry notes.

110686,Argentina,"A tale of two wines. The early impression is that of a foxy, incomplete, sweaty wine with gaps in the fabric. But once it gets air, things turn around for the better.

The wine throws a heavy sediment, and is best considered an ager, although it has no history. Try 2010–2014.",Moment of Truth,91,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Waterfront
110891,France,"90-92 Barrel sample. Under its new name, the second wine of Haut-Brion is fruity, soft, rounded. The character is of blackcurrant and juice, finishing with a fine fresh lift.",Barrel sample,91,,Bordeaux,Pessac-Léognan,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Le Clarence de Haut-Brion
110892,US,"Picture-perfect Syrah, from the peppery-spicy aroma to the full-bodied mouthfeel and the lush, blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors.

110893,US,"Co-fermented with Marsanne, this shows more forward fruit than Reynvaan's In The Rocks Syrah. It's dominated by fruit, spice and pepper, along with a hint of granite. The herbal side of the grape is here a bit constrained, and the wine has the structure—especially the minerality—to age for a considerable time. For young fruit (first leaf) it's a triumph, and promises great things to come.",The Contender,91,55.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Reynvaan Family Vineyards

110896,France,"90-92 Barrel sample. Forward, fresh wine, that has some good intensity as well. There is a creamy, ripe character under the freshness, hints of attractive wood.",Barrel sample,91,,Bordeaux,Pessac-Léognan,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Carbonnieux
110897,France,"90-92 Barrel sample. Austere and mineral, this is a tight wine, held by bonds of tannin. The structure is based upon dark plum skins, as well as potentially rich fruit.",Barrel sample,91,,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Clos Fourtet
110898,France,"90-92 Barrel sample. Firm and austere, dark with tannins that come from a dry core, with high acid around. The fruit is juicy, but it is on the edgy, dry side. Unlike usual vintages of this wine, it seems to need aging.",Les Forts de Latour Barrel sample,91,,Bordeaux,Pauillac,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Latour

110901,US,"The Artist Series blend is quite Cabernet-centric in 2006—58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Merlot, 6% Malbec and just a splash of Petit Verdot.

110907,US,"In 2006, the Syrah stands as the best of the Columbia Crest reserves.

110909,US,"Lots to like in this complex red Bordeaux blend.

110911,Australia,"Clarendon Hills' “entry-level” Syrah comes from vines that are only 12 years old, but it is still a very good effort. The bouquet includes graham cracker, sour red plum and herbal notes, while the palate picks up some dusty, red-earth flavors. The finish is crisp. Minus the minerality, it's comparable to a good Crozes-Hermitage in a warm year.",Bakers Gully,89,65.0,South Australia,Clarendon,,Syrah,Clarendon Hills
110912,Spain,"This is the type of wine that's giving resurgent Jumilla a positive reputation. The nose is smoky but still loaded with solid fruit, while the palate bubbles over with pure blackberry and plum. It's a Monastrell-dominated blend, but it tastes a lot like Tempranillo, which is only 15% of the blend. Very nice overall.",Selección Roble,89,13.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Red Blend,Alceño
110913,US,"There's something exuberantly old-fashioned about this Pinot. It's dark, dry and tannicly rustic, with huge, gobby, fresh cherry pie flavors deep inside.

The softness may limit ageability.",,89,45.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Blue Rock
110915,US,"Lots to like in this Cab. Few regions do a better job of ripening red wines than Paso Robles while keeping prices modest.

110917,Greece,"Xinomavro, meaning acid-black, is one of Greece's better indigenous reds and the only variety in Naoussa. It can make wines with firm acidity and jackhammer tannins, as in this example, which also shows a spicy nose of black pepper, coffee and red fruit.

Will soften a bit with time.",Ramnista,89,22.0,Naoussa,,,Xinomavro,Kir-Yianni

110921,US,"Soft and juicy, with extremely ripe fruit that's almost jammy, this 100% Cabernet is complex and interesting.

110922,US,"This refreshing wine has that extra something that pushes it to the next level.

110924,New Zealand,"Craggy's Chardonnay is a big boy, with fully ripe fruit (14.5% alcohol) that's framed by ample oak. Yet it shows some restraint as well, with aromas of pencil shavings and minerals that nicely complement pear and melon fruit. With a richly textured, almost gravelly mouthfeel, the wine shows good depth and richness.

110931,Greece,"You could easily get lost in this wine's bouquet: plenty of new, spicy oak, scents of plum and blackberry pie, later picking up anise and coffee. On the palate, a streak of acidity is followed by soft, dry tannins, making way for more blackberry and anise.

110937,Spain,"A touch heavy, but not nearly as weighty and syrupy as this winery's '03 Excelencia. At 14%, it's a bit raisiny and blustery, but the dark plum and coffee flavors do manage to please.

110974,Argentina,"Having always liked this wine, which is 86% Cab and the rest Malbec and Merlot, the 2002 seems a touch bland and underwhelming. The color is dense and the nose muscular and herbal, but it peters out quickly and shows no signs that it will get better with age. Imported by Quintessential Wines, LLC.",Enzo Bianchi,86,53.0,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Red Blend,Valentin Bianchi
110975,US,"Nice, rugged mountain Zin, with the briary, brambly tannins and peppery taste of wild berries freshly picked off the vine. Alcohol adds heat and structure, and time in the barrel has softened the tannins. This might just be the perfect backyard barbecue red wine.",,86,16.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Plungerhead
110976,France,"Good, spicy Cabernet Franc, loaded with dry plums and stalky fruit flavors. It's soft, with a streak of acidity to give freshness, but mainly juicy and fruity.",Vallée des Jardins,86,11.0,Loire Valley,Saumur,,Cabernet Franc,Remy-Pannier
110977,US,"A honeyed, velvety-smooth wine. It's ultrarich in cherry pie, raspberry cream and white chocolate truffle flavors, although it's technically dry. The soft tannins, glycerine and high alcohol add to the perception of sweetness.",The Crusader,86,20.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Syrah,Burford & Brown
110978,US,"This Vidal Blanc offers tropical fruit flavors of peach and pineapple and a playful, lively acidity. Balanced and bold, the wine has enough personality to sip on it own. A fun white wine alternative at a nice price.",,86,10.0,Virginia,Virginia,,Vidal Blanc,Chateau Morrisette
110979,Argentina,"A little loose on the bouquet, with a whiff of sulfur and leather to go with wild berry aromas. In the mouth, it's got an Old World coarseness that turns the flavor profile to pepper and espresso. At 60% Cabernet and 40% Malbec, it's worth the price.",Dos Fincas,86,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec,Carlos Basso
110980,Italy,"This wine is a bit strange, especially on the nose where it yields too generous notes of cocoa butter, sun tanning lotion, butterscotch, cherry and sweet vanilla. The nose is definitely sweet, bordering on cloying, and tight tannins will need time to soften.",,86,40.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Farina
110981,Austria,"This Cabernet Sauvignon is rare for the Feilers. Normally the fruit goes into a blend. But in 2005, they have chosen to release a varietal Cabernet, a lean, somewhat austere wine, showing the aging potential, but also just showing some green character. Tough, with high acidity.",,86,20.0,Burgenland,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Feiler-Artinger
110982,US,"From century-old vines growing in a warm part of the valley comes this soft, layered Zin. It shows wild blue- and black-skinned berry fruits that approach raisins, rum punch, cherry liqueur and rosemary-thyme flavors. Tasty Zin, a little simple in structure, but nice and dry.",Old Vines Estate Grown,86,18.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Zinfandel,Ballentine
110983,Austria,"Classic in Austrian terms means no, or very little wood, leaving the fruit to speak for itself. Black cherry fruits, pure and refreshing, suggest this could even be a summer red served chilled.",Classic,86,18.0,Neusiedlersee,,,Zweigelt,Gerhard Pittnauer
110984,Argentina,"Leather, dark fruit and citrus peel make for a good nose, while the palate is meaty and a bit heavy as it pours on those classic dark-fruit flavors that Malbec is known for. Best to get at this one now because neither the palate nor the finish shows much acidity. A touch hollow.",Reservado,86,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Viña Amalia
110985,US,"The best thing about this fine young white wine is the acidity. It's high and crisp and bracing, and makes the peach pie, honeysuckle and vanilla wafer flavors come alive. There's a honeyed sweetness, but that wonderful acidity balances it nicely.",,86,18.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Tocai Friulano,VJB
110986,Argentina,"Big and jammy, and all in all it's a solid, good Malbec. Aromas of tar and prune give way to plum and blackberry flavors. On the finish, it's a touch salty and drying, but with food it will be smoother. Good for the money, although limited in depth and complexity.",Reserva,86,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Santa Julia
110987,US,"As much as I like this Merlot, it feels like they let it get too ripe and gave it too much oak. It was a great vintage, and the grapes ripened effortlessly. Yet there's a baked fruit, toothpicky oakiness that robs the wine of elegance.",,86,42.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Arrowood
110988,US,"This is ripe to the point of richness, showing broad, mouthfilling flavors of melon and fig and just the merest hint of mint. Drink now.",Carol's Vineyard,86,16.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,J. Lohr

110990,US,"The elements of great Cab are all here, from the rich, mountain-dense tannins to the gorgeously ripe blackberry, cassis and fig flavors that are enriched by lots of new, flashy oak. But there's a sweaty funk in the aroma that's off-putting, and makes you wonder.",,86,70.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ladera
110991,Austria,"A very open, soft wine that shows lightweight, attractive red fruits. Its softness makes it drinkable now, with fresh acidity dominating the lower layer of dry tannins.",Selection,86,,Burgenland,,,Red Blend,Lenz Moser
110992,Austria,"“Trie” is a play on Gunter Triebaumer's red blend (Zweigelt, St Laurent, Cab Sauvignon); a deliciously fresh wine, spicy, peppery and very food friendly.",Trie,86,14.0,Neusiedlersee-Hügelland,,,Red Blend,Gunter Triebaumer
110993,Argentina,"Solid, ripe and smooth on the nose, then red cherry and raspberry come forward on the zesty, tangy palate. The finish is long and healthy, but a bit monotone in its delivery. Freshness and pop are not lacking in this young Malbec.",,86,12.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Finca El Portillo
110994,France,"A creamy wine with toast and acidity. There is an element of spice and a freshness that comes from some green fruit flavors. Soft, gentle aftertaste.",L'Insolite,86,25.0,Loire Valley,Chinon,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine des Roches Neuves
110995,US,Aromas of apple and tropical fruit on this rich Chardonnay lead into vanilla and honey on the palate. The wine is full and opulent in the mouth but not overwrought. Good balance and a lingering finish add to the appeal.,,86,16.0,Virginia,Virginia,,Chardonnay,Chateau Morrisette
110996,France,"The blend—Chenin Blanc, Chardonnay and Cabernet Franc—is typical of Loire sparkling wines. It gives a full mousse in the mouth, herbal and green pea flavors, and a soft, creamy aftertaste, backed up by acidity.",Les Doucinières,86,22.0,Loire Valley,Crémant de Loire,,Sparkling Blend,Château Gaillard
110997,Argentina,"Finding affordable but good Cab is not an easy chore, so let this solid, smoky wine fit that bill. The nose is like a cowboy campfire, complete with hickory, leather and cured meat. The palate is full-force and tannic, with plum and berry fruit. It may be slightly cooked and not for the long haul; so drink now.",Reserva,86,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Julia
110998,Argentina,"Clove and other challenging aromas greet you, and never does this blend of Malbec, Cabernet, Bonarda and Merlot get it fully together. The palate seems a little reduced and short on feel, and while it widens and softens on the finish, the ride to get there is bumpy. Expect better in 2005.",Corte B,86,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Vistalba
110999,US,"SLO has always struggled with this variety, but Wildwood seems to be getting the knack for Cabernet. Tastes like the grapes were grown in a warm area and yields were carefully limited: the flavors of blackberries plums and mocha are rich. The challenge is to improve structure, and particularly tannins, in a wine of this price.",Jackson's Vineyard,86,35.0,California,San Luis Obispo County,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wildwood
111000,Spain,"Somontano is not exactly prime real estate among Spanish wine regions, but Blecua, a four-grape blend led by Cabernet Sauvignon, is one of the best wines the region has to offer. Smoke, licorice, rooty cola and lemony oak aromas mix with flavors of blackberry, coffee, cola and roasted meats. It's a bit choppy and hard now, but time will help it along. A classy wine to drink from 2011 through 2016.",Blecua,91,100.0,Northern Spain,Somontano,,Red Blend,Viñas del Vero
111001,US,"Winemaker James MacPhail brings his touch to this ripe, delicious Pinot Noir. It explodes in raspberries and cherries, but it's no more fruit bomb. Shows fine acidity and even a dusting of tannins that provide structural integrity. Really nice now, and should develop over the next 4–6 years.",Sarmento Vineyard,91,32.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Sequana
111002,Italy,"Here's a dense, dark Brunello with aromas of moist soil, forest floor, exotic spice and tones of black fruit, prune, plum and currant.

Pair this wine with grilled red meat or pasta with meat sauce.",,91,,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Sesta di Sopra

111004,US,"Oriana blends Roussanne, Viognier and Riesling to good effect. This nicely evolved 2007 has a bouquet of lemon oil, citrus and hints of white blossom.

It's drinking beautifully right now.",Oriana White,91,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,White Blend,Brian Carter Cellars
111005,France,"Ripe and creamy, a classic sparkling Vouvray showing well in a cool year. It has weight and richness as well as fresh nuts and spice flavors, with just a touch of pepper. The acidity is well in balance.",Cuvée Prédilection Brut,91,19.0,Loire Valley,Vouvray,,Chenin Blanc,Château Moncontour
111006,Spain,"A rewarding wine that isn't overly pricey or difficult to enjoy. Dark, lightly baked aromas hint at raisin and marshmallow, while the palate has a deep texture and vital acidity. Savory, tea-infused flavors bring pulse and kick, and as a whole it delivers a true reflection of what Ribera del Duero should be.",Damana Crianza,91,21.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas y Viñedos Tábula
111007,France,"A concentrated, rich wine, packed with peach and pear flavors, the freshness coming from ripe apples and green plums. While the fruit dominates, there is always a good edge of minerality, tightening the wine, giving it a taut, crisp aftertaste.",Grand'Chaille,91,,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Thomas & Fils
111008,Spain,"Earth, rubber, spice, oak and bold berry aromas give this a classic Ribera nose, while the palate is pure and sensual, with shining raspberry, strawberry and plum flavors. Control and poise are on display, and the finish is clean, dry, warm and satisfying. Will be better in two or three years; best from 2012 through 2018.",Malleolus,91,71.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
111009,Portugal,"With plenty of weight, but weight that is concentrated around a tight, firm tannic core. The wine has great ripe plum and black cherry fruits, brimming from the glass.

111010,Italy,"Pian delle Vigne comes from vineyards planted in lower lands compared to many other Montalcino crus. This results in slightly higher temperatures during the growing season and thicker, sweeter wines. What it loses in complexity it gains in generous tones of sweet cherry, chocolate and spice. The wine's texture is round, rich and opulent.",Pian delle Vigne,91,75.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Marchesi Antinori
111011,France,"A big, solid wine, dominated by both tannins and dark red fruits. This is an impressive wine, its structure full of dark corners. The acidity is an integral part of the rich fruits. Definitely ageworthy.",Domaine de la Chaponne,91,,Beaujolais,Morgon,,Gamay,Georges Duboeuf
111012,US,"Released unusually at the age of nearly five years, this Chardonnay is losing its primary fruit. It's developing a toasted cashew and hazelnut character, and the pineapples are transmogrifying to chewy dried fruits and even Christmas fruitcake. Meanwhile the sweet, caramelized oak is fully integrated. Bravo to the winery for holding this back and letting us see what an older Sonoma Coast Chardonay does.",Fort Ross Vineyard Reserve,91,40.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Fort Ross
111013,Italy,"This is an elegant and traditional Brunello with bright fruit notes including wild berries, cherry, plum and red currants.

The wine is smooth and polished in the mouth with a touch of sweet berry on the close.",,91,75.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Querce Bettina
111014,Portugal,"A well-structured wine, with black plum and spice, keeping the acidity and fruitiness of the vintage, and projecting them into a rich texture.

111016,US,"Ultrarich and forward in fruit, and what's wrong with that? Floods the palate with pie filling flavors of cherries and raspberries, with a rich coating of oak that adds vanilla, buttered toast and caramel. The richness is balanced with crisp acidity.",Dutton Ranch,91,40.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Sequana
111017,US,"Like all of Reverie's 2007 reds, this one's super-tannic. In fact, it's one of the hardest, most astringent Napa Cabs on the market. Still, it has a rich core of blackberries and currants, with lots of smoky oak, and the spicy fruit lasts a long time on the finish. A good sign for cellaring. Try after 2013.",Estate,91,65.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Reverie
111018,US,"Here's a beautifully lush, rich Pinot Noir. Made in a silky, drink-me-now style, it has flashy flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and sandalwood.

111019,Italy,"There are interesting aromas here of cherry, chocolate, rhubarb, cola, wet earth, forest floor and dried violets that make this Brunello Riserva a bit out of the ordinary.

111020,US,"You have to look closely at the back label to see that this is sourced from the outstanding Boushey Vineyard in Washington's Yakima Valley. But there is no doubt once you taste the rush of blueberry/blackberry fruit, swathed in smoky meat, bacon fat, dried tobacco and composted earth flavors. Incense aromas weave through, with firm acids holding the wine in focus.",,91,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Verve
111021,US,"Full-bodied, it leans into stone fruits and light tropical. Tasted a few weeks before its official release, it remained a little sugary, with its relatively high alcohol (and lower acidity) adding to the impression of sweetness.",Wallula Vineyard Biodynamic,91,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Riesling,Pacific Rim
111022,Portugal,"Broadened by spicy wood, this is a smooth, rich and opulent wine. It has sweet plum and black cherry flavors to go with its dense texture.

111023,Italy,"Here's a Brunello Riserva with a delicate, feminine nose that recalls elements of forest fruit, pressed violets, cherry cola and dried herbs.

111024,France,"Made from old vines in a single vineyard, very intense even in its youth. It has a smooth, creamy texture over a core of flint and herbaceousness.

111025,Italy,"Fattoria dei Barbi's 2005 Brunello opens with a ripe, saturated ruby color and thick aromas of black cherry, tobacco, leather and a playful touch of exotic spice.

111026,US,"A very interesting Chardonnay, and easily worth the price. It was fermented in 50% new French oak, which gives it a creamy, smoky richness, while the underlying fruit flavors are ripe and rewarding, suggesting pineapples, Asian pears, green apples and Meyer lemons. A beautiful, complex and balanced wine.",Director's Cut,91,20.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Francis Ford Coppola
111027,US,"Shows tremendeous richness and impressive weight along the lines of a Chardonnay, although the flavors are lighter and more refined, suggesting tangerines and Meyer lemons.

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Blanc,Alma Rosa

111030,Argentina,"Big and burly, with a semi- syrupy nose that brings berry jam, molasses, shoe polish and crusty, baked berry aromas. But don't dismiss this Cab as overripe and over the top; it is complete and balanced, with good acidity pushing black fruit, chocolate, clove and herb flavors to their maximum expression. And it dials it in on the finish, where cola and coffee notes are just right. Drink now through 2010.",Catena,89,22.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Catena Zapata
111031,US,"This 2008 is the third vintage for this extraordinarily popular Riesling, again showing bright, vivid, punchy citrus fruit and juicy acids.

111032,US,"There's good funk and bad funk; this is right on the border. Scents of earth and compost, gamy meat and bitter greens run amok on the palate, almost concealing the fruit. The interplay of flavors and the overall complexity and length mark this as a Spofford Station Syrah, but just as it should be knitting together, it falls apart, leaving a trail of black olives in its wake.",Spofford Station Estate,89,32.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,JLC
111033,US,"Inherit (as in the meek shall… etc.) is a very ripe, dark and somewhat pruney wine with massive dark accents. The blend smoothes it out and softens the animal notes.

111036,US,"Very dark dark and tight, this is an almost-complete Bordeaux blend (includes everything but the Petit Verdot) but it is dominated by the 87% Cabernet Sauvignon.

111042,Germany,"Released in the U.S. a bit later than most German wines, Raimund Prüm's 2006 Würzgarten kabinett remains primary and fresh, filling the room with aromas of green apple, lime and slate.

111047,US,"A Chateauneuf-style, ruby red blend of 52% Syrah 26% Mourvèdre and 22% Grenache. Lots of spice and black pepper to complement the bright red fruits. Still very young and not-quite resolved; the aromatics have a fresh cut lumber smell, though very little new oak was actually used in the wine.

The finish has an herbal tinge.",Élite,89,48.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Conde de Siruela
111050,Spain,"A mixture of baked fruit, bacon, asphalt and leather aromas is impressive, and so is the bright, composed palate and its flavors of plum, raspberry and tobacco.

111051,US,"Intense and very spicy, this mixes dense, liquorous and very dark flavors —soy, balsamic, coffee extract, smoke and more—with leafy, herbal, peppery scents.

111321,France,"There is some richness here, a wine that has sweet plum and spice flavors followed by a toasty character. The fruit has some stalkiness, while the acidity is very present. Could age well.",Domaine René Couly,90,18.0,Loire Valley,Chinon,,Cabernet Franc,Couly-Dutheil
111322,US,"Shows the slight tug of herbaceousness that often marks Carneros/Napa Chardonnays.

111323,US,"A very nice Chardonnay that's dry and crisp and elegant. Shows tart, leesy flavors of citrus fruits, apricots and pears, with a steely minerality that may come from those famous Livermore rocks.

111324,Portugal,"Loureiro has made the region of Ponte de Lima its home, and this full and rich wine brings together the crispness with a more serious perfumed character.

111325,US,"A very nice red wine for drinking now with foods from all sorts of ethnicities and styles.

111331,Spain,"The aromas are powerful and just the slightest bit brambly. A little hot and rugged on the palate, but loaded with prime black fruit, pepper and mocha notes.

Acidity comes from fresh lime. It could do with some aging, maybe 2–3 years.",Escolha Branco,89,19.0,Bucelas,,,Arinto,Quinta do Boição
111334,Portugal,"An exotic blend including Pinot Noir and Merlot along with Portuguese varieties, taking its name from two local villages with saint's names. It has acidity and an awkward bitter edge, with tough black fruits. Maybe it needs time for the wine to soften and meld with the tight acidity.",,89,25.0,Bairrada,,,Pinot Noir,Campolargo
111335,US,"The addition of 6% Grenache to the blend is effective, contributing bright spicy red fruit highlights. The Syrah is varietal, with bloody beef, dried herb and dark, peppery fruit.

Very pretty but with a backbone, this wine can age for added elegance.",Limited Release,94,93.0,Stellenbosch,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ernie Els
111376,US,"This is Washington Syrah at its most distinctive. The fruit stands out with tart and tangy flavors of boysenberry, raspberry and a tartness reminiscent of cranberry. There are streaks of meat, smoke and bacon, and the acids are clean. This is a glorious food wine, but so juicy, assertive and delicious that it almost demands to be drunk on its own. Will it evolve in the cellar? Probably, but it's hard to keep your hands off it long enough to find out.",,94,29.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Robert Karl

There is some dryness to finish.",Quinta do Panascal Vintage,94,49.0,Port,,,Port,Fonseca
111378,US,"From the famed Monte Rosso Vineyard Ed Sbragia has crafted a wine that needs time in the cellar. Strong, hard tannins shut down the currant and cherry fruit, making the wine astringent.

111379,US,"It was barrel-fermented, using wild yeasts, and aged on the lees. The vineyard is in the coolest part of Napa Valley, and in this cool vintage, acidity is the most important part of the wine.

Lush and smooth as velvet, it shows enormously deep, ripe blackberry, cherry, raspberry, leather, cola, soy-splashed Portobello, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors.

111387,US,"This blend is concentrated and meaty. It perfectly captures and combines the raspberry intensity of the Grenache, the brambleberry fruit of the Mourvèdre and the peppery smoke and spice of the Syrah.

111399,Chile,"At 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet, this signature blend from La Rosa exhibits touches of green on the nose but mostly deep black fruit. The palate runs thick and sticky courtesy of extract and tannin, however, the flavors of plum, chocolate and bacon are satisfying. Quite a big, meaty red.

111489,Australia,"Smells very nice. The wine deals vanilla bean, nutmeg, musk and floral notes. This isn't a Chardonnay for the tropically inclined. There's fruit here, but it's taut (think unripe pear, sour apple, peach pit, that sort of thing). Sparse on the fluff overall.

111494,Australia,"Tasted twice with differing impressions; this score represents the average of the two. One look at the wine showed roasted aromas, and an orange-peel aroma, followed by sour red fruit on the palate. The second go revealed juicier fruit and pleasing, chalky tannins on the palate.

111514,US,"Here's a compact, young Chard that's tight in minerals and acidity, riding high over well-oaked tropical fruit and peach flavors. It's closed now, and should be allowed to breathe for a while. Drink now through 2009.",Reserve,88,29.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Merryvale
111515,France,"First you notice the new wood flavors and aromas, then you see the name of the consultant, Michel Rolland.

111518,US,"This Mendocino region has some very old Syrah vines, and they have produced a dark, soft, lush Syrah, with an earthy component to the blackberry and mocha flavors.

111519,US,"Released at four-plus years, unusual for a Merlot, but the tannins are beginning to melt, although they're still formidable.

111533,US,"This opens with tart, tight leaf and beetroot flavors, which overlay quite soft, round and riper fruit. The integration of earthy tannins with the fruit is a little disjointed; what shows most clearly are the leafy, herbal plant flavors.

111535,US,"Tough, dry and tannic, with an unrelieved quality, this is a wine that needs serious time in the cellar or major decanting to let it soften.

Showing ripe red and black currant flavors that have been generously oaked, it's a gorgeous young Napa Valley Cab that should develop through 2014.",Steve Lee Reserve,93,95.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,V. Sattui
111665,US,"This is just too young to drink now. The interplay of the acids and tannins locks down the flavors and make a sting on the palate. But there is the terrific core of flavor, of ripe blackberries and cherries, of red and black currants, of cola and root beer and licorice, that will emerge in time, making for delicious drinking. Best 2009–2013, possibly longer.",Quail Hill Vineyard,93,60.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
111666,US,"Dr. Joe Gunselman's wines consistently show polish and verve, and this is always the best of them. There are streaks of every conceivable red fruit, a layer of chocolate, a whiff of coffee, a lick of butterscotch and plenty of vivid acids. The wine is sleek and yet powerful, and the flavors suggest layering which in turn suggests complexity and a long life ahead.",Inspiration Reserve,93,45.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Robert Karl
111667,Italy,"This is a breakthrough vintage for Castello d'Albola and its team of winemakers who have crafted a truly beautiful and compelling wine rich with soft tones of chocolate fudge, almond paste, chewy cherry and long-lasting blueberry tones. The wine is plush and chewy in the mouth with big fruit flavors, yet it remains elegant and balanced at the same time.",Acciaiolo,93,60.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Red Blend,Castello d'Albola
111668,Portugal,"A powerhouse, but one that shows a certain degree of lushness to its robust blackberry and mint flavors. Finishes long and minerally, bolstered by slightly drying tannins. Should be more approachable by 2015 and last for three decades beyond that.",Vintage,93,83.0,Port,,,Port,Dow's
111669,US,"This shows wonderfully layered, complex flavors, in addition to great structure. Thoroughly dry, with rich, fine tannins, it flatters with red and black currant, red cherry, milk chocolate, licorice, root beer, vanilla, dusty spice and smoky oak flavors. Luscious now and through 2010.",Alluvium Red Table Wine,93,30.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Beringer
111670,US,"Shows the impeccable balance you expect from this master winemaker, even in this hot vintage, where supermaturity was a challenge. The wine is certainly ripe, offering a mouthful of blackberries, cherries and currants. But it never loses its elegant tannin-acid architecture. Beautiful now, and should develop through 2014.",,93,50.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arrowood
111671,France,"A round, full-bodied wine that goes for the generous, opulent fruity aspect of red Burgundy with its big, blowsy red fruits, just kept in check by tannins. The acidity is lively and fresh, keeping pace with the intense vibrant fruits. Screwcap.",,93,169.0,Burgundy,Chambertin,,Pinot Noir,Jean-Claude Boisset
111672,US,"A delight to drink, with bright cherry and cola flavors nuanced with earthier tones of tobacco, rosehip tea and anise. The way the wine feels in the mouth is beautiful, all silk and satin. This balanced Pinot Noir defines elegance, and should improve for a few years.",Truchard Vineyard,93,25.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,X
111673,US,"A new bottling from the winery, made from vines grown 2,000 feet up the mountain that were planted only in 2001. It's far too immature to drink now or anytime soon. The tannins are thick and on lockdown, the blackberry, cassis and cherry fruit all primary and not yet integrated with the oak. But these parts are high-quality and need time to mesh and develop. Best after 2010 through 2016 and beyond.",Yverdon Vineyard,93,70.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Terra Valentine
111674,Chile,"Altaïr is a fortressed high-end Cabernet blend with mineral and charred aromas announcing a palate coated with dense berry flavors, tobacco, vanilla and balsamic notes. It's a complex wine that is fairly tough out of the bottle. Ideally it should be cellared for another three to five years.",Altaïr,93,80.0,Cachapoal Valley,,,Cabernet Blend,Altaïr
111675,France,"An impressive wine, fueled by black plum juice flavors. The acidity is just right, balancing the richness of the fruit. The wine revels in the serious side of Echezeaux, packed with dark, tight tannins over the fruit. It needs at least five years, maybe 10.",,93,115.0,Burgundy,Echézeaux,,Pinot Noir,Jean-Claude Boisset
111676,France,"Big, juicy fruit, bolstered by tannins, gives this wine weight and impressive structure. There is a dry core surrounded by ripe plums, herbs and fresh spices , resulting in soft, juicy freshness. But those tannins promise aging potential.",Beaux-Monts Premier Cru,93,125.0,Burgundy,Vosne-Romanée,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Moillard
111677,US,"This is the biggest and ripest of Talley's Pinots, the kind some criticize as Rhône-like. Yes, it's full-bodied, and you might mistake it for Grenache, with its cherry flavors and voluminous tannins. Yet it's beautifully balanced and complex, and should develop bottle complexity for a decade. If you drink it now, pair with big dishes, like duck or game.",Rincon Vineyard,93,58.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Talley
111678,Portugal,"A finely structured, impressively elegant wine, packed with dark fruit skin flavors, heavy with tannins and delicious perfumed fruit. While it is rich, it is also dry, suggesting excellent aging potential.",Vintage,93,50.0,Port,,,Port,Quinta de la Rosa
111679,US,"Few Cab Francs from California will benefit from aging, but this one will. It has that toughly tannic scour that suggests time in the cellar. But so rich are the cherry, root beer, datenut bread, licorice and tangerine zest flavors that the wine should easily negotiate the years. Best mid-2008–2012.",Persephone Vineyard,93,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Franc,Peju
111680,US,"Far Niente has produced a tannic, drily astringent young wine that's nowhere near ready to drink. It's tough as nails, with a gritty astringency that locks down the black currant and dark, unsweetened chocolate flavors. But it is a very balanced, distinguished wine that should easily negotiate the next 10 or 15 years, with proper cellaring.",,92,120.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Far Niente
111681,Italy,Here's a Brunello that plays on the variety's subtle and refined notes of forest berry and boysenberry rather than ripe cherry; almonds or roasted chestnuts rather than obvious wood. It's a beautiful product with understated power and intensity that lets its elegant nature shine bright.,Riserva,92,80.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Fattoria dei Barbi
111682,US,"Shows a degree of complexity that's rare in an Edna Valley Pinot, where fruit and acidity are easy, but layers of depth are hard. You'll find upfront cola, cherry, licorice, persimmon and smoky oak flavors, with deeper notes of sautéed wild mushrooms and sweet mulch. Should age well for six to eight years.",Reserve,92,45.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Edna Valley Vineyard
111683,US,"Beringer's twist on white Bordeaux, this Semillon and Sauvignon blend adds small amounts of Chard and Viognier to produce a tremendously invigorating white wine. Barrel fermented and aged on the lees, it's rich and exotic in custardy pineapple, fig, peach, apple, wildflower and vanilla spice flavors that finish with great length. Crisp and dry.",Alluvium Blanc,92,16.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,White Blend,Beringer
111684,Italy,"Moscadello grapes are left to dry on the vine and the barrique-fermented wine ages one year on the lees. The result is a delicate, understated dessert wine with admirable harmony and buoyancy. Jasmine, peach, natural rubber, almond blossom, citrus and orange peel best describe this elegant wine.",Vendemmia Tardiva,92,59.0,Tuscany,Moscadello di Montalcino,,Moscadello,La Poderina
111685,US,"Very rich and stylish, a complicated young white wine of great elegance and flair. The bone-dry flavors are of lemongrass, gooseberry, juniper berry, pink grapefruit, vanilla and smoke, accented by brilliantly crisp acidity. This is one of the best Napa-appellated Sauvignon Blancs of the vintage.",,92,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Le Petite Coquerel
111686,US,"A blend of Syrah and Petite Sirah, Shafer's Relentless is a testament to the winery's commitment to these varieties despite their domination of the Cab market. The wine shows the huge power and balance of Shafer's Cabernets, with a different flavor profile. It's soft and gentle but complex in ripe tannins, with blackberry, cherry, cassis, cola, red licorice, sweet tobacco and rich Asian spice flavors. Drink now through 2010.",Relentless,92,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,Shafer
111687,South Africa,"Curvy, full and luscious but underpinned with a fresh acidity that gives the wine balance, this white blend from Tulbagh Mountain has a creamy fruit and spice character that is both delicious and unique. The wine finishes with length but is clean. Could handle richer dishes but is still delicate enough to augment lighter fare.",TMV White,92,29.0,Coastal Region,,,White Blend,Tulbagh Mountain Vineyards
111688,Italy,"That ever-present Tuscan sun has done its part to ripen a beautifully intense and complex Pinot Noir.

111690,Chile,"Our favorite of the Botalcura white wines, there's only 20% Viognier, but it makes a strong impression, adding floral and orangey scents to this round, creamy wine. Peach and melon flavors show ripeness and class without seeming too sweet or flabby.",El Delirio,87,12.0,Central Valley,,,Chardonnay-Viognier,Botalcura
111691,Australia,"An interesting Shiraz, this one's plummy aromas and flavors have one foot in the prune/raisin camp. Still, there are pretty flavors of Christmas spice, bread flour, tea and tobacco here, too; the latter two leave a somewhat sour taste on the finish. Imported by Old Bridge Cellars.",,87,18.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Shiraz,Mak
111692,Italy,"Mildly baked on the nose, with aromas of fired clay, roast plum and fresh tomato.

111693,US,"Like the regular Chardonnay, Beuna Vista's regular Pinot Noir is a medium-bodied, easy-drinking version of the variety. There's enough herbal complexity to keep it interesting, but the cherry-tinged fruit is ripe and the tannins supple. Finishes with a burst of crisp acidity.",,87,22.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Buena Vista
111694,US,"A good effort crafting a moderate, Yakima Valley  Cab. There's a bit of the herbal stuff here, but it's done well, balanced and appropriate. The tannins are slightly green but smooth, and there are no bitter edges. Smooth and interesting.",Cowan Vineyard,87,21.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Eleven
111695,Italy,"Everything about this dessert wine—its color, consistency and body—is smooth and seductive until your nose encounters a solid wall of wood. A tad too much toast, in my opinion, translates into blackened bread crust and peanut oil warming in an iron skillet and makes it difficult to locate the dried flowers and fruit aromas. Yet the wood does frame the wine's sweetness nicely and some may love it.",Privilegio,87,56.0,Southern Italy,Campania,,White Blend,Feudi di San Gregorio

111701,Australia,"McLaren Vale is not renowned for its white wines, yet this Chardonnay is a very good, appealing sip. It's medium-sized with apple and pear aromas and flavors dominating.

111703,US,"Sebastiani knows Barbera. At its best, which this one is, the variety produces a very dry, very tannic and high-acid wine, rich in earthy, coffee, cherry-berry flavors.

111706,US,"With its slightly drying tannins and firm finish, this is a steakhouse Merlot, not a soft, easy sipper to drink on its own, yet it's not overpowering in weight.

111708,US,"From a cool area of the valley comes this very dry, astringently tannic wine, which is not very fruity.

111751,US,"Here's a rich Chardonnay with tropical fruit pastry flavors that have a dusty, dried herb edge, and lots of creamy oak. The wine is a bit soft. The fruit and spice flavors reprise on the long-lasting finish.",Reserve,87,42.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Clos du Val
111752,Spain,"Pinot Noir-based cavas are touchy; sometimes they take on a rough, peppery personality that some might find offputting. This wine does that, but only to an extent. The nose pushes peach pit and campfire aromas, while the palate features dry fruits like papaya and melon, but with cinnamon and pepper shadings. Good mouthfeel and well made, but the flavors and aromas require some getting used to.",Brut,87,14.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Pinot Noir,Codorníu
111753,Spain,"Brick colored, with a baked, spicy nose that is true Rioja in that it also pushes Sherry, raisin and cinnamon notes. Fairly dry, acidic and zesty in the mouth, with cherry and cola flavors. Forceful acidity keeps it moving along. Needs food to absorb that acid.",Reserva,87,18.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Castillo Labastida
111754,France,"A salmon-infused slate color, this wine starts off gently with a nice yeast aroma. Citrus flavors interact with light boysenberry, again with a soft overlay of yeast. Crisp, with nice body and good bubbles, this is balanced and delicious.",Perle Noire Blanc de Noirs,87,15.0,France Other,France,,Sparkling Blend,Louis Bouillot
111755,US,"Kynsi's Syrahs are small production but worth seeking out.

111756,US,"Known for his Pinots and Chards, Rick Longoria tried hard with this red, even though Santa Barbara has struggled with Bordeaux. Wisely, Longoria bases the wine on Cabernet Franc and Merlot, which do better in cooler climates than Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is fine, rich and promising.",Evidence Red Wine,87,42.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Longoria
111757,US,"Let this one breathe for an hour or two. At first it tastes a bit tired, but oxygen perks it up and restores vivacity to the fruit. Ultimately, it's a very softly structured, very dry wine, with complex cherry, coffee, herb, cola and tea flavors. Drink now.",Bell Mountain Vineyard,87,35.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Medlock Ames
111758,US,"After tasting Napa Cabs, it takes an intellectual step sideways to appreciate a Cab like this from Paso Robles. It's totally dry, sharper in acids and mintier than its northern cousins, but has a cherried flair that makes you want to drink it with a steak.",Devine,87,38.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Peachy Canyon
111759,Greece,"Mantinia is the appellation for Moschofilero, a versatile grape that makes fine, crisp whites. This is a good example, a light, dry, crisply acidic wine that pours on the lemon-lime from start to long finish. Perfect to pair with oysters or grilled swordfish.",Mantinia,87,17.0,Mantinia,,,Moschofilero,Nasiakos

111761,US,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot, it's sourced from the western side of Paso, which is the cooler, better side. A great deal of new French oak was put on. The result is promising. It's a full-bodied, dry wine, firm in dusty tannins, and with pronounced blackberry and cola flavors. A wine to watch.",,87,52.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Red Blend,Treana
111762,Spain,"Generally speaking, this wine is nicely balanced and a bit less over the top than most 2003s. The nose shows mint, fresh herbs, graphite and berry aromas. The palate is juicy, not dull or heavy, with black cherry and dark plum flavors. Finishes almost crisp, with a shot of balancing acidity.",,87,17.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tempranillo,Tres Lunas

111764,New Zealand,"From a top-notch vintage in Hawke's Bay, Villa Maria's entry-level Bordeaux-style red is an undeniable success.

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Sanford
111766,Spain,"Deep in color, falling somewhere between copper and red. The nose is forward as could be, with raspberry and a strong hint of orange blossom.

Based on Pinot Noir; you can taste the essence of that variety at its core.",Aria Brut Rosé,87,12.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Pinot Noir,Segura Viudas
111767,Spain,"With its citrusy nose and well-balanced palate, this is what Best Buy sparklers are all about. Tangerine and orange peel grace the bouquet, while crisp flavors of berries and stone fruits win you over. A bit of strawberry and snap close the deal. Nice stuff.",Brut Rosé,87,10.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
111768,US,"Here's a tough, young, tannic wine, not drinkable now, but it shows promise. Those pesky tannins lock down the blackberry flavors, making the wine taste even drier than it is. Try after 2009.",,87,86.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Atlas Peak
111769,US,"This is an old-style wine: it's the kind of Cabernet that made Cabernet famous in California.

111770,Argentina,"This lighter-bodied blend has a lot in common with a good Côtes-du-Rhône.

A nice bistro wine.",Picada 15,87,8.0,Other,Neuquén,,Red Blend,Bodega NQN
111771,US,"Strong, powerful in green grass, gooseberry and nettle flavors, a very dry, highly acidic wine with a minerally streak. No malolactic fermentation occurred and no oak was involved.

111772,New Zealand,"Sturdy black cherry and cola notes anchor this fairly priced offering from Marlborough. It's a bit chunky, without Pinot's classic silky mouthfeel, but solid and dependable, picking up some menthol notes on the finish.",,87,17.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Mount Riley
111773,New Zealand,"New World Chardonnay, done well. Toasty, mealy aromas accent slightly tropical, peach-like scents on the nose, while the flavors are ripe and fruit-driven, suitably framed by butter and toast. It's a medium- to full-bodied wine, its long finish tinged with hints of butter and tropical fruit.",,87,20.0,Nelson,,,Chardonnay,Greenhough
111774,US,"Richer and tarter than Kenwood's regular '05 Chard, this wine shows the acidity and green apple flavors of the central part of the valley.

111777,US,"Peachy has long produced an Old School House Zin, but this is the first OSH Cab I know of.

111778,Greece,"This dry, vibrant wine has loads of cherry and strawberry flavors that nearly crunch in the mouth. A blend of Agiorgitiko and Moschofilero, two of Greece's most versatile grapes, this is best drunk young to retain its freshness. It should be a superb match for grilled fish and feta salad.",Zoë!,87,10.0,Peloponnese,,,Rosé,Skouras
111779,US,"Dry Creek Valley seems to coax a wild, feral quality from Sauvignon Blanc. Gooseberries, nettles, fresh green thyme and dandelion greens all give a rich earthiness to the usual citrus, fig and melon flavors. Acidity in this wine is high, too, giving it a crisp, clean mouthfeel. Very nice, at a great price.",,87,14.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Trentadue

111783,Argentina,"Not a bad value. The wine is a touch reduced and short on mouthfeel and aromatics, but it still delivers creamy vanilla flavors, raspberry essence and decent density. The sum of all its parts is better than the individual components. Best now, and in casual settings.",Oak,84,8.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Telteca
111784,US,"Soft and sweet, although there's a lot going on, taste-wise. Flavors of pineapples, peaches, pears and vanilla are wrapped into an oaky, creamy package.

111785,US,"Pellegrini's Cabs always seem to have a rustic edge, meaning the sharp-elbowed tannins, and the green, dried herb flavors that dominate.

111787,US,"I'd like to like this wine more than I do, because the acidity is brilliantly clean and scouring, which is a good thing, and the citrus, gooseberry, fig and wildflower flavors are very Marlborough-like. But the sugary finish is a letdown.",Estate,84,16.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Clos La Chance

111790,Argentina,"Better than jug wine even if it comes in a big bottle, with clean, lightly expressive cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. There's a little heat and roughness to the finish, but given the league that it's playing in you can't complain about the overall quality of this Mendoza Cabernet. A big-time barbecue or party wine.",White Pearl,84,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Antonio Cesar Cavalli
111791,Argentina,"Opens with a smoke shack full of hickory and jerky before settling in a dark mass.

111797,US,"Just about half Chardonnay and half Pinot Noir, with a touch of Pinot Meunier, this fruit-forward bubbly  tastes sweet, even by California sparkling wine standards.

111799,US,"Like most Garys' Pinots, this is an enormous wine in both fruit and alcohol. It detonates on the palate with mega-flavors of ripe cherries, raspberries and vanilla cola.

111848,Spain,"Intriguing earthy, leafy aromas as well as a lot of roasted meat and berry fruit to the nose. Any high expectations, however, are lost on the palate, where it's sour and scouring.

111927,US,"A broad streak of vanilla is set against beautifully ripe, tart and polished raspberry and black cherry fruit.

This is almost steely, with tart wild berry flavors and an earthy base.",South Chapel Block Red Willow Vineyard,88,30.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Columbia Winery
111931,Italy,"You have to admire the roundness and supple softness of this Sauvignon. Yes, it has sharply aromatic notes of tomato leaf and exotic fruit, but they are delivered in a delicate and harmonious fashion. The wine is crisp and lean with enough substance to pair with spicy Indian dishes.",,88,19.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,Sauvignon,Comelli
111932,US,"This is a very big, extracted, extremely rich Pinot Noir. It's a bit ungainly now, like a gawky adolescent who's growing too fast. Could develop greater finesse with a year or two in cellar. The fruity flavors are ripe and fat, of cherries, currants, cola, red plums and dates. Try after 2009.",Savoy Vineyard,88,55.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Barnett
111933,Spain,"Admittedly we are tasting this later than we'd prefer, but for an '07 it is still showing vital signs and attractive aromas of sugared pastry, candied apple and lemon-lime. The palate is mostly fresh, though not as lively as it probably was nine months ago, while the flavors of 7Up and peach are refreshing. Drink immediately or wait until the 2008 arrives.",Dona Rosa,88,25.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Adega Martínez Serantes
111934,Italy,"This wine opens with a pristine and pleasantly compact nose that is accented by delicate tones of peach, honey and yellow acacia flower. The wine is creamy and soft in the mouth with playfully sour notes of citrus and exotic fruit on the close.",,88,35.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,Friulano,La Roncaia
111935,Italy,"This pretty Pinot Bianco features big aromas of sweet orange, almond and stone fruit. The wine offers a rich, tightly packed mouthfeel with layers of light spice and mineral on the close. You get both elegance and intensity.",,88,24.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,Pinot Bianco,Jacùss
111936,US,"Rugged and robust, with flavors of grilled blackberries, plums and a meaty taste, like stir-fried ground beef splashed with soy sauce and dusted with black pepper. Fine with sausage-based pasta dishes.",Incredible Red,88,12.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Peachy Canyon
111937,Portugal,"Blending Alvarinho and Trajadura, oenologist Anselmo Mendes has created a deliciously creamy but dry style of Vinho Verde. The citrus character is there, but the texture is open, just hints of apple skins over the apricots and white peaches.",Clemen Reserva,88,13.0,Vinho Verde,,,Portuguese White,Touquinheiras
111938,US,"Real pretty strawberry fruit shows right away. The 20% Sagemoor vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend was finished in new Hungarian oak, which does add some assertive spice. It's got some grip, plenty of acid, and flavors dominated by the new oak.",,88,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sangiovese,Tulpen
111939,Italy,"Here's a bright Friulano with a luminous golden color and intense aromas of honey, peach and passion fruit. The wine tastes soft and supple in the mouth and delivers loads of fruity peach flavors on the close. What's nice about this wine is that it delivers high structure and lively fruit fragrances at the same time.",,88,18.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,Friulano,Vigna Traverso
111940,Italy,"Lively fruit aromas are backed by loads of papaya, mango and grapefruit in this stylish expression of Sauvignon from northern Italy. The wine is smooth and compact in the mouth with more texture than expected.",Vigneti Sant'Helena,88,25.0,Northeastern Italy,Collio,,Sauvignon,Vigneti Fantinel
111941,Italy,"Year after year, this is one of our favorite Chardonnays from Northeast Italy. This year, however, there is an aromatic element out of place and the wine seems unable to deliver its bouquet with the same intensity. You do get exotic fruit and toasted nut but the wine really excels in the mouth thanks to its creamy, spicy flavors.",Grafin de la Tour,88,60.0,Northeastern Italy,Collio,,Chardonnay,Villa Russiz
111942,Argentina,"Warm black-fruit aromas along with earth and controlled oak give this Malbec a nice bouquet, and the palate features full berry flavors and a dark-spice accent. The finish is smooth, mellow and slightly chocolaty. Satisfying, legitimate Malbec in every way.",Barrica,88,14.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Notro
111943,Germany,"This plump, medium-bodied kabinett seems destined for early maturity, as it relies on a touch of unreleased CO2 to give it liveliness. Drink it young while it's still fresh, and before the bold apple, pear and citrus flavors fade.",Scharzhofberger Kabinett,88,29.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt
111944,Italy,"Brought to us from the distant 1999 vintage, Cialla Bianco (a blend of Ribolla Gialla, Verduzzo and Picolit) demonstrates that white wines from Northeast Italy can age. The wine delivers aromas of sweet orange, candied fruit, caramel and butterscotch. It's creamy and sweet tasting too.",Cialla Bianco,88,44.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,White Blend,Ronchi di Cialla
111945,US,"There's not much, if any, oak on this Chardonnay, leaving the fresh, clean fruit flavors to star. Shows a rich array of pineapples, Meyer lemons, yellow apricots and peaches, with spicy, vanilla overtones. Elegant, and a good buy at this price.",,88,18.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rued
111946,US,"This wine doesn't miss not having any oak, because the flavors are rich enough on their own. Backed up with crisp acidity, it offers a wealth of Meyer lemons, pineapples, ripe pears, peaches, lemongrass and spices. Try with a salad of bitter greens, shallots, grapefruit and garlic shrimp.",,88,16.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Rued
111947,Italy,"This fabulous Sauvignon shows amazing aromatic intensity. Young and crisp, the wine offers exotic fruit, lemongrass, and chopped basil, then finishes zesty and crisp finish.",,88,24.0,Northeastern Italy,Collio,,Sauvignon,Russiz Superiore
111948,US,"Creamy and lightly toasty, this elegant Chardonnay mixes its melon/apple fruit with vanilla cream and toasted cracker. The acid feels natural and brings in suggestions of pineapple, with a nice smack of butter kicking out the finish.",Estate,88,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Ryan Patrick
111949,Australia,"This is a burly, firmly structured Grenache evidently meant to age, which makes it a little tough to evaluate right now. Big black cherry fruit lacks complexity, marked mainly by faint toasted-almond nuances. Try after 2010.",,88,72.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Grenache,S.C. Pannell
111950,US,"A World War II–era pinup, caught mid-salute with a glass of wine in her left hand, makes this one of the more eye-catching labels to hit the shelf this year. It's a solid effort, which could pass for a Merlot if it had the requisite 75%. Chunky, cherry/chocolate flavored, and quite delightful.",Vineyard Salute Bombshell Red,88,16.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Airfield Estates
111951,Argentina,"One of the best Argentine value Chardonnays on the market. The nose is stylish, with butterscotch, honeyed apple and vanilla notes. Smooth on the palate, with more than adequate apple and peach flavors, and then pure and fairly long on the finish. For clarity and real Chardonnay character, there aren't many better options than this, especially for $12.",,88,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Alamos
111952,US,"This is an enomoursly rich Chardonnay that positively explodes in apricot jam, pineapple, vanilla custard and butterscotch flavors. It's balanced with crisp, cool-climate Carneros acidity that makes it tangy and clean. Easy to find, with 33,000 cases produced.",,88,20.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Artesa
111953,US,"Lush and fragrant, and happily and distinctively not tasting like a Washington Cabernet or Merlot, this is a bowl of rose petals and ripe cherries. Strong acids, earthy tannins, slivers of chocolate and a finish of espresso all combine into a lovely and lasting set of flavors. 100% varietal, aged in neutral barrels.",Cuvée Lucia Ciel du Cheval,88,28.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Sangiovese,Andrew Will
111954,US,"A Syrah rosé produced bone dry in collaboration with Charles Bieler from Talbott vineyard fruit. Light tawny pink, with excellent texture and surprising length. The label is all print, designed like an old poster, but laid out like an American flag—very clever, as usual with Charles Smith.",,88,11.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Rosé,Charles & Charles
111955,Portugal,"A blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon, with Touriga Nacional, to give a tight wine, solid, taking its austerity from the 2006 vintage. The berry fruits offer structure, and allow the wine to finish with a fresh note.",Termeão,88,30.0,Bairrada,,,Portuguese Red,Campolargo
111956,Italy,"Cantarutti delivers a thickly saturated and concentrated Friulano with almost passito-like aromatic intensity. You'll recognize tones of apricot, honey and candied fruit and the wine tastes dense but soft in the mouth. It's a dry wine with a touch of sweetness, however, that would pair with white meat, cod or mackerel.",,88,16.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,Friulano,Cantarutti
111957,US,"Cabernet Franc ripens nicely in Washington, and has built a bit of a cult following, as it is usually available in tiny quantities from tiny boutiques such as Cuillin Hills. This is a solid effort, loaded with tangy boysenberry and plum-flavored fruit. It's ripe, clean and fruit-driven, and the oak (25% new) lightly handled, adding whiffs of toast and coffee.",Weinbau Vineyard Reserve,88,38.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Franc,Cuillin Hills
111958,Spain,"The “value” label from Condes de Albarei is always a good bet. Oceanic aromas and a spritz of lime make the nose just right, and the lively palate of lemon, melon and banana is charged up. Tight on the finish, with citrus and almond skins, and then a lasting impression of pineapple. Young and raring to go.",Salneval,88,10.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Condes de Albarei
111959,US,"What a beautiful Pinot Grigio. It's fresh and crisp in coastal acidity, with a brilliantly clean mouthfeel framing delicious flavors of ripe peaches, pears, pineapples, honey, vanilla and cinnamon spice. Sommeliers: a great restaurant wine.",,88,14.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Pinot Grigio,Mandolina
111960,US,"Amador Foothill does a good job with Sangiovese, and this dry rosé is made from that variety. It's a cheerful wine, brisk in acidity and with delicate but complex cherry, rose petal and lavender flavors. The winemaker recommends bouillabaisse, which is a pretty good suggestion.",Rosato of,86,11.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Sangiovese,Amador Foothill Winery
111961,Chile,"More full and powerful than the regular Merlot, with berry compote, lemon peel and toast on the nose. Fairly full in body, while the red-fruit flavors are solid and familiar. Has good structure and a linear finish. Good in its class.",Winemaker Reserve,86,14.0,Rapel Valley,,,Merlot,Confin
111962,Greece,"An unusual blend of 60% Tannat and 40% Montepulciano, the first from Greece (or anywhere), this has a beautiful nose of cured meat, fresh crushed berries, and vibrant vanilla. Tannat's heavy tannins are present, as is plentiful acidity. Dark purple fruit and vanilla flavors are pure and modern, but this wine would be better if it wasn't so tart.",One,86,65.0,Greece,,,Red Blend,Alpha Estate
111963,Chile,"Light strawberry aromas work the not too heavy bouquet, while standard red fruit controls the palate. In the mouth, it's crisp and snappy, with a tiny touch of acidic scour. Finishes clean and right, and shows overall freshness.",Reserve,86,13.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Merlot,Carmen
111964,Italy,"This is textbook cool-climate Chardonnay with banana, nut, vanilla and exotic fruit packaged within compact and polished aromas. Lemon rind and floral flavors render crispness and freshness.",,86,9.0,Northeastern Italy,Vigneti delle Dolomiti,,Chardonnay,Mezzacorona
111965,Italy,"Another interesting wine made from an obscure indigenous grape, this white is very fragrant and rich with tones of grapefruit, yellow flowers, white powder, pear and melon. It has strong and attractive mineral characteristics in the mouth and ends on a bitter note.",Podere Colle Vecchio,86,23.0,Central Italy,Offida Pecorino,,White Blend,Tenuta Cocci Grifoni
111966,Chile,"Round, chewy and full-bodied, with cherry as well as mint and fresh herbs on the bouquet. Fairly saturated, with sweet, sappy red-fruit flavors shading licorice and bitter chocolate notes. Not complex but quite pleasant.",Oak Aged Reserve,86,13.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Viu Manent
111967,Italy,"Fairly roasted and earthy, with a lot of coffee, leather and dark berry to the bouquet. Definitely weighs in as full bodied, and flavorwise the fruit runs dark, with licorice and toast shadings. Finishes kind of grabby and tannic, but generally speaking it's solid stuff.",Riserva,86,20.0,Tuscany,Chianti,,Sangiovese,Origin
111968,Italy,"It has been years since we reviewed Burchino, and it's more or less the same wine now that it was in 1997. The nose offers light fruit and cinnamon shadings, which sit in front of strawberry and plum flavors. The finish may be a touch raw and grabby, but as a whole it's snappy enough to stay the course.",,86,13.0,Tuscany,Chianti Superiore,,Sangiovese,Burchino
111969,Chile,"Cedary and slightly herbal, but backed by ample cassis fruit, Botalcura's top Cabernet boasts a silky-smooth texture and nicely balanced acidity—its main drawback is its limited length on the finish.",La Porfia Grand Reserve,86,20.0,Rapel Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Botalcura
111970,US,"There's a lot of pedigree in this Cab. It's beautifully dry, with a fine structure in which fruit, wood, acidity and tannins play well off each other. The tannins, though, are very strong, to the point of astringent lockdown. But there's no reason not to cellar this wine until 2010, at the earliest.",,86,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cosentino
111971,Chile,"This Carmenère-based heavyweight also packs in Cabernet and Merlot. The aromatic result is of candy and spice, but also some reediness. The palate is powerful and a touch aggressive as bulky tannins and sharp acidity push cherry and plum flavors toward a tight, grabby finish.",Gold Assemblage Carmenere,86,18.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Red Blend,Estampa
111972,US,"Intensely jammy in red cherry fruit, this likeable, easy wine also shows a crisp acidity that grips the palate and balances the superripeness. There are flavor and texture complexities that lift it out of the ordinary.",Oleta Vineyard,86,26.0,California,Fiddletown,Sierra Foothills,Grenache,Martella
111973,US,"Here's a tight, acidic young Chard from this cool-climate appellation. It's showing lots of mineral flavors now, against a background of Meyer lemon and apricot, and the finish is totally dry.",Pacheco Vineyard,86,18.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kinter Collins
111974,Chile,"Blueberry and a hint of bacon get it going. Next up is a dense palate that offers touches of mushroom, spice and gentle black fruit. Not at all racy or loud; the wine lacks bold acidity but still registers as mostly balanced.",Armador,86,12.0,Maipo Valley,,,Syrah,Odfjell
111975,Australia,"Big and dark but angular, this Cabernet sports plenty of oak and blackberry flavors, but also some sourish green wood and eucalyptus flavors.",,86,29.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ranfurlys Way
111976,US,"Opens with scents of honey, pear, cracker and spice, leading into warm, round fruit flavors. The deep gold color and the soft, open palate indicate a bit of oxidation, and the wine goes flat in the midpalate, though for near-term drinking it offers unusual pleasures. Serve this one slightly chilled.",Mariposa Vineyard,86,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Roussanne,White Heron
111977,Chile,"Barnyard meets pickle at first, but airing gives more clarity to the nose. The palate is a bit murky but it's also loaded with meat, cola and dark, almost baked fruit. The mouthfeel is tight and strong, with tannins that hit hard and then hang around for the finish.",Gran Reserva,86,17.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,TerraNoble
111978,Chile,"Tropical fruit carries the bouquet, while the palate is citrusy and lively as it ranges from ripe grapefruit to pineapple and on to orange. Fresh on the tongue, with laudable balance and structure. Nothing outrageous but perfectly good.",Vineyard Selection,86,9.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,TerraNoble
111979,Australia,"Tyrrell's wines are meant to be aged, which may be why this Shiraz isn't particularly singing right now. The nose offers an overt rubber/plastic note, backed by some blackberry underneath. Moderate amounts of cool, black-cherry flavors characterize the palate. Would be worth a look in 2010 to see how it's changed. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Vat 8,86,40.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,Shiraz,Tyrrell's
111980,US,"Apricots, grapefruits, apples, figs, peaches, melons—there's a whole orchard in this dry, crisp PG. It has a particular savory character from the citrusy acids. What a great price for this wine.",,86,10.0,California,California,California Other,Pinot Grigio,McManis
111981,Greece,"Dark purple fruit and fennel open on the nose, while this wine has a lively mouthfeel with nice acidity, big tannins and a minerally feel. Berry fruit, clay, and fennel play their role in the mouth, finishing with dark herbs.",,86,12.0,Aigialias Slopes,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Oenoforos
111982,Italy,"This is run of the mill PG, but its low pricing makes for an attractive ensemble: You'll get honeysuckle, exotic frit, citrus and some soapy tone, too.",,86,10.0,Northeastern Italy,Delle Venezie,,Pinot Grigio,Campanile
111983,US,"Not a total success. It tastes both soft and hard at the same time; the fruit is tight, tart and tapers off quickly. Tannins are softened to the point of being inconsequential. The wine lacks grip.",Artist Series,86,48.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Meritage,Chateau Ste. Michelle
111984,Chile,"Plum, blackberry and other dark fruits coat the smooth bouquet. The palate is fairly intense, with saturated plum and berry flavors. Very solid and tight, with ripe tannins and a chewy feel. Good Cabernet that will please most.",Winemaker Reserve,86,14.0,Rapel Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Confin
111985,Italy,"Shows mature aromas of cherry and balsam wood, with men's cologne wafting in the background. Tastes a bit sweet, yet it's lively; the strawberry and blueberry flavors stop short of syrupy. Not a refined wine but it's full, clean and tasty. Great for casual drinking.",Cantalupi,86,10.0,Southern Italy,Salento,,Negroamaro,Conti Zecca
111986,Italy,"Light and crisp, with flowery aromas that are more subtle than forced. Pear, apple and banana flavors are smooth yet a touch dilute, while the finish is dry and tight, but short. Would make for a nice aperitif if properly chilled.",Le Bruniche,86,14.0,Tuscany,Chardonnay di Toscana,,Chardonnay,Tenuta di Nozzole
111987,US,"Stimulatingly fresh and clean, this polished Sauvignon benefits from very high acidity that makes those tastebuds whistle. It shows fig, Tequila, grapefruit and nectarine flavors and a finish of white pepper. Notable for its dry, keen freshness.",,86,18.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Sauvignon Republic
111988,Australia,"Practically black in color; vanilla and plum aromas start it all off. In spite of its color, this is not a dense wine. It's very forward, its red fruit playing off a sawdusty-woody texture in the mouth. Not harmonious, with more sawdust on the finish.",The Bull and the Bear,86,59.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon,Two Hands
111989,Italy,"Made from one of Southern Italy's most eclectic indigenous grapes, this is a less aromatic red that delivers small, but equal doses of blackberry, licorice, resin and slate. The mineral component is the most noticeable: As if the vines sucked it straight up from volcanic soils.",,86,27.0,Southern Italy,Lacryma Christi del Vesuvio,,Red Blend,Terredora
111990,France,"If Nuits-Saint-Georges has a gentler side when young (as a contrast to the normal firm tannins), this wine shows it. The tannins are certainly here, but the ripe fruit shines through more than balances that dryness. Fresh strawberries and red plums round this off.",Les Thorey Premier Cru,92,90.0,Burgundy,Nuits-St.-Georges,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Moillard
111991,Portugal,"Approachable now, but capable of further positive evolution, the 1980 is lush and supple, with abundant chocolate and dried-spice flavors and a long, warming finish. Drink now–2025.",Vintage,92,90.0,Port,,,Port,Dow's
111992,US,"The home vineyard is in a cool, southeastern part of the valley, and you can smell the minerality in this crisp, young wine, grown in the fog.

111993,New Zealand,"Craggy's Chardonnay is undeniably world-class, and wouldn't be out of place in a blind tasting with premier cru Burgundies. Toasty French oak frames elegantly restrained fruit on the nose and then vanilla, peach and tropical fruit flavors unfold on the palate, finishing long, tinged with orange sherbet and dried spices. Imported by Kobrand Corporation.",Les Beaux Cailloux Gimblett Gravels,92,50.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Chardonnay,Craggy Range
111994,US,"Biodynamic grapegrowing and stainless-steel fermentation have collaborated to produce this fresh, keen and brilliant young Sauvignon Blanc. It's so clean and zesty in acidity, you can't help but admire it, and the flavors only add to the attraction. Lemon, lime and grapefruit citrus have richer notes of figs, melons and vanilla. This is really a gorgeous, dry white wine.",Casey's Block,92,29.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Sauvignon Blanc,Benziger
111995,Chile,"Smooth as perfectly blended chocolate on the nose, with exceedingly comfortable yet ripe black-fruit aromas.

As good a Chilean Syrah as you're likely to find.",Altum Single Vineyard,92,22.0,Maipo Valley,,,Shiraz,TerraMater
111996,US,"You'll want to stash this fresh, young Syrah away for a couple years. It's pretty tannic now, locking down the palate. But what fruit! Enormous in blackberries, currants and cola, with an undertow of bitter chocolate, pepper and black olive tapenade. Give it until 2009, if you can.",Rosella's Vineyard,92,33.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Syrah,Novy
111997,Chile,"A warm, dry vintage yielded an excellent Casa Real in 2003. The wine delivers a measured bouquet of balsam wood, violet petals, mineral and ripe berry aromas, while the leisurely palate is home to spot-on raspberry, black plum and cassis flavors. Long, oily and textured on the finish, with admirable overall structure. Drink now through 2011.",Casa Real,92,60.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Rita
111998,US,"Picture-perfect Dry Creek Valley Zin. So lush, so delicious, you just can't get enough.

111999,France,"Although this is dominated at this young stage by wood, you can get through the firm, spicy character to the dark, heady fruit flavors. It has concealed power and intensity of ripe, elegant fruit. It needs at least 10 years to mature.",Clos des Cortons,92,102.0,Burgundy,Corton,,Pinot Noir,Faiveley
112000,Italy,"Here's a gorgeous Brunello that achieves that ever-so delicate balance of fruit versus menthol notes versus toast to render an unforgettable drinking experience. This is why they say Brunello can't be made in any other part of the world outside this tiny corner of Tuscany: Intense notes of chewy cherry, carob, licorice, almonds, chopped herbs ride over dusty tannins and a long finish.",Vigna del Fiore,92,120.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Fattoria dei Barbi
112001,Chile,"Seductive tobacco, moss, campfire and earth notes are just some of the subtleties that run alongside deep and pure berry and cassis flavors. Whereas Le Dix 2002 is hard and stunted, this wine is lush and balanced. It hints at olive and herbs but settles on quality fruit and a bed of nice tannins. A very pure and well-made Cabernet Sauvignon that can be drunk now or aged for at least another five years.",Le Dix de Los Vascos,92,44.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite)
112002,US,"This concentrated wine leads with citrus and stone fruits, and a lightly peppery mouthfeel. Leesy and creamy and textural, it's generously loaded with flavors of lime and grapefruit, stone and fresh herb. This is a subtle and very refreshing Viognier.",Conner Lee Vineyard,92,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Viognier,Mark Ryan
112003,Portugal,"Meaty, bacon aromas on this still-young vintage. Its tannins are great, a dry style of wine, densely packed over deep layers of black fruits. The acidity and finely perfumed fruit are coming together well. This should age well – all the elements are there.",Vintage,92,,Port,,,Port,Poças
112004,Portugal,"A rounded, ripe, sweet wine, touched with caramel and dry figs. There's generous, rich fruit, and a feeling of warmth from spice and dark plums. Ripe, leavened with acidity for aging.",Vintage,92,80.0,Port,,,Port,Quinta do Crasto
112005,Portugal,"Vineyards don't get more remote than Ervamoira, in the heart of the Côa national park of prehistoric wall drawings.

112006,US,"Elegant and complex now, this young wine will develop bottle complexity over the next six years. It has a silky, refined texture, with concentrated flavors of cherries, black raspberries, cola, pomegranates, persimmons and cinnamon spice.

This is one of the best Mondavi Reserve Pinots of the past decade.",Reserve,92,55.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Robert Mondavi
112007,US,"This is a rather deep yellow straw color, and follows in the style of the winery's distinctive 2005 bottling, with a rich blend of scents and flavors. Lemon polish, jasmine and honey-soaked apricots, tea and tangerines all conjoin in a dense, concentrated and lush wine. The finish carries on with honey, toasted almonds, flowers and an Alsatian oiliness. It's one of the most concentrated and unique Rieslings produced in a state known for them.",Smasne Vineyard Estate Dry,92,22.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Riesling,Smasne Cellars
112008,US,"Cabernet Sauvignon gives this wine a luscious, elegant mouthfeel, with classic currant and cedar flavors. Syrah brings a gamy, leathery note, with white pepper accents. The result is an interesting, complex young wine of power and authority. Drink now.",,92,52.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Red Blend,Treana
112009,US,"The '04 Spottswoode shows the enormous ripeness of the vintage, with lush currant, blackberry jam, chocolate-covered cherry candy and spice flavors, plus an earthier note of sweet green olive tapenade. For all that voluptuous flavor, the wine maintains great structure.

112012,US,"Red Mountain fruit from three different sites is used to create this delicious Syrah, laced with powerful flavors of coffee liqueur and chocolate. Cofermented with a dash of Viognier, it's satiny and citrusy, speckled with pepper, and maintains an elegant precision for a wine that offers such richness.",Wild Eyed,92,40.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Mark Ryan
112013,US,"One of the ripest, highest alcohol Mondavi Reserve Cabs in memory, this wine is forward in cassis and cherry flavors, and while the tannins are pretty sturdy, it's sweet and soft enough to drink now. It definitely has the rich mouthfeel you want in a pricey Napa Cab. But it's young; cellar this one until at least 2010.",Reserve,92,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Mondavi
112014,Italy,"Inspired by the Bordeaux tradition and made from a blend of Cabs Sauvignon and Franc, Burdese is a rich and perfumed wine with penetrating notes of blackberry, currants, tobacco and exotic spice. It is full bodied and concentrated without being overextracted thanks to its vibrant red fruit flavors, silky tannins and long finish.",Burdese,92,39.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Red Blend,Planeta
112015,France,"Initially earthy aromas give way to red fruits. The wine follows the same pattern, the barnyard flavors opening out with the ripe red plum and strawberry fruits. There is a delicious richness here, balanced with acidity and firm tannins.",Santenots Premier Cru,92,95.0,Burgundy,Volnay,,Pinot Noir,Pierre Morey
112016,US,"Juicy and ripe, this Bordeaux blend is an elegant young wine with earthy flavors of blackberries, cherries and new smoky oak. Notable for its exceptional balance, it should hold well through 2012.",,92,50.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Meritage,Clos La Chance
112017,US,"This is a really luscious wine—100% varietal—with unusual richness. The flavors are dense and detailed, a mix of sweet grain, clover and beeswax along with lychee, pear, white peach and pink grapefruit. Smooth and full-bodied, it keeps on going through a lingering, lightly honeyed finish. The label is a colorful drawing of a blonde angel surrounded by stars.",,92,18.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sémillon,Beresan
112018,US,"This is Chris Gorman's first white wine; it has been babied and it shows. The wild yeast fermentation in 100% new French oak really piles on the rich, butterscotch flavors, along with toast, spice, nutmeg and caramel. But there's fruit to match, powerful and thick, with impressive length and weight.",Big Sissy Conner Lee Vineyard,92,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Gorman
112019,France,"Dark, spicy wood aromas, which pass through to the palate. The huge fruit is powerful, too, a fruit salad of red and black berry fruits, dominated by fresh acidity and sweet and sour acidity. Needs at least 4–5 years aging.",Domaine du Pavillon Clos des Maréchaudes,92,,Burgundy,Corton,,Pinot Noir,Albert Bichot

112021,Spain,Opens with candied berry and salinic aromas. It's tough in its youth and also a little too funky to inspire much confidence for the future.

112028,Argentina,"Best Buy wines come in all shapes and sizes. This one settles at the bottom of the category, which doesn't mean that it doesn't have its charms, namely sweet and ready fruit and just enough acidity to keep it from being cloying.

Drink now.",Giles,84,45.0,South Australia,Lenswood,,Pinot Noir,Henschke
112041,US,"The winery's '05 reserve is oakier than their regular Chard, and the wine is heavier and less fresh, an impression heightened by full malolactic fermentation, which has softened the acidity and given a buttery taste.",Reserve,84,28.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Chardonnay,Zina Hyde Cunningham

112043,US,"This hits the palate rather hard and green, with thin fruit that does not seem quite ripe.

The wine reverts to its green side as the tannins take over.",Skylite Vineyard,84,24.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Skylite
112044,Argentina,"A little sharp and unfocused on the nose, but the palate is simple and juicy, with tangy red-fruit flavors backed by good acidity and solid tannins.

112047,US,"A pretty good everyday Merlot, made from all-coastal grapes, not from the Central Valley. The cherry, blackberry and plum flavors are nice, the tannins are smooth, the wine is totally dry. The one negative is a sharp, minty green streak.",Vintner's Reserve,84,19.0,California,California,California Other,Merlot,Kendall-Jackson
112048,Argentina,"A touch creamy and milky on the nose, with shy tropical aromas in support. The palate shows warm-climate melon and peach flavors on a round, chunky frame.

112050,US,"There's no oak to give fans their daily dose of buttered toast and vanilla. But there is plenty of pure, unadulterated fruit—apricots and peaches to be exact. It's a rich, spicy wine that advances the argument for no-oak Chard.",Estate Oak Free,87,18.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,St. Supéry
112051,Italy,"The most noticeable aroma is marzipan, which also comes though beautifully in the mouth. You'll also get pine nut, peach, melon and yellow rose.

112052,US,"Ladera's regular Napa Cab is really good. This one's nearly twice the price. What do you get? The wine is higher in alcohol, and tastes woodier, too, with a sugared blackberry tea sweetness. It's a little ponderous now, but you might want to stick it in the cellar for five years or so and see what happens.",,87,68.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ladera
112053,US,"Yes, the vintage is correct. Who else is releasing a 2001 Pinot in 2006? Yet it's a good wine, dry, clean and silky, with cherry pie, cola, rosehip tea and spice flavors. That Edna Valley acidity has preserved it well.",,87,41.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Orfila
112054,New Zealand,"Saint Clair's entry-level Sauvignon is a flashy, fruit-driven wine with a touch of green that's keeping reams of peach and grapefruit reined in. Not quite as rich as the regular bottling, but the Vicar's Choice is a couple of bucks less expensive and still offers a characterful Sauvignon Blanc with a long, vibrant finish.",Vicar's Choice,87,14.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Saint Clair
112055,New Zealand,"A solid example of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc at a reasonable price, this shows off hints of stone fruit accented by jalapeño pepper.

112056,Spain,"With some toast and popcorn to fatten up the standard apple aromas, this is a fairly rich cava, especially given the price. Apple, pear and cinnamon flavors grace the palate, while the finish is persistent beyond expectations. Not overly bubbly but still lively. Strides better than your average quaffer.",Original Brut,87,9.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Codorníu
112057,Spain,"As under-$10 sparklers go, you'd be hard-pressed to find better than this medium-bodied and toasty version from Catalonia's White Castle. The nose is mildly yeasty but basic, while the palate deals juicy apple and white-grape flavors propelled by fresh acidity. Virtuous yet basic. But who's complaining?",Extra Brut,87,8.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Castellblanch
112058,US,"Napa Gewürz is a rare bird these days, especially an estate bottling from a winery as fine as Cosentino.

112059,US,"Here's a good Napa Cab at a decent price that will take some cellar age. Mainly from Rutherford grapes, it's showing some stiff tannins, but, with polished cherry, herb and oak flavors, it drinks well now, and should develop for five years.",,87,30.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Flora Springs
112060,US,"Over the years my scores for Alluvium have been all over the board. This wine, a Bordeaux blend based on Merlot but with all five classic varieties, is a bit edgy in tannic structure, with a rustic bite.

112061,Australia,"Shows a bit of unintegrated oak on the nose—dry toast and vanilla notes stick out—but there's also a fair dose of blackberry fruit to go with it.

112062,US,"A bit closed now, locked down by stubborn tannins and a slight mustiness, but it's a very good wine that should begin to open in a few years.

112063,US,"You can tell from the name that it's a mixture of (mainly) Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah.

112064,US,"Merlot has not been this winery's strong point, but this new wine from a vineyard just north of Napa city is their best yet.

Probably at its best now.",Napa River Ranch,87,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Hall
112065,New Zealand,"This reasonably complex Marlborough Chardonnay features pear and citrus fruit accented by hints of butter and spice.

112068,US,"This is St. Supery's other Chardonnay, the oaked one. It's not super-oaky, but it does have buttercream and vanilla notes in addition to the wine's apricot, peach and tangerine flavors.

112069,US,"Green grass, hay, gooseberry, juniper berry, alfalfa, grapefruit, lime, you get the idea. It's a complex wine. Zestily acidic and clean, it will get the tastebuds going.",Ghielmetti Vineyard,87,24.0,California,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Steven Kent
112070,Spain,"A little bit sweet and doughy, but hardly offputting. Deep flavors of cherry, raspberry and strawberry control the palate, while the finish is chocolaty and long.

112071,Italy,"Smooth and chummy, with a light but fragrant nose featuring the slightest hint of yeast. Tasty in the mouth, with clean flavors of apple and mineral.

112073,US,"A blend of eight varietals, kind of a Rhône-Bordeaux blend, this red shows a true Lodi typicity. It's soft in acids and tannins, and just luscious, with a milk chocolate edge to the blueberry, blackberry, cherry, pomegranate and coffee flavors, and there's a rich sweetness on the finish.",Red Wine,87,19.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Red Blend,Incognito
112074,France,"This wine shows a richer, smoother mouthfeel than others of its ilk. The nose is nicely toasty, with tropical fruit aromas and mint. Flavors are similar, dealing out nicely oaked fruit that goes down easily.",Brut,87,16.0,Burgundy,Crémant de Bourgogne,,Sparkling Blend,Jaillance
112075,Greece,"Very pale, with a green tinge and aromas of vanilla, nectarine and lychee, this blend, (70% Roditis with Sauvignon Blanc and a touch of Gewürztraminer) is an enjoyable quaffing wine.

112078,US,"This Cabernet-based Meritage also contains a significant amount of Malbec.

112203,US,"Previous vintage were called L'Etalon but a threatened legal action prompted the name change. It's the same type of Bordeaux blend. When first opened it's quite firm and tannic; as it breathes you'll note hints of violets and a core of cassis, all beautifully proportioned.",Le Coursier Red Wine,90,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Brian Carter Cellars
112204,US,"In this newest vintage of Oriana, the Riesling component has been bumped up to 18%; the rest is half Viognier, 31% Roussanne. The three grapes complement each other well; the Riesling adding aromatics, acidity and a barely perceptible amount of residual sugar. This opens with a vitamin pill aroma that slowly dissipates; the fruit flavors are a mix of pineapple and Satsuma orange, with lots of natural acidity.",Oriana White,90,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,White Blend,Brian Carter Cellars
112205,Portugal,"Just turning in color, a wine that is beginning to mature. It has leathery texture over spice, ripe tannins and flavors of red fruit jelly. There is a bitter coffee character that melds easily into the tannins. It is a delicious wine, balanced and made for food.",Pegos Claros,90,14.0,Palmela,,,Castelão,Companhia das Quintas
112206,France,"A wine with some weight, but also fresh, clean and crisp fruit. The Pellé style is for very ripe grapes, expressing richness as well as the terroir. Here the mineral edge is present, along with tangy flavors, but finishing much richer.",Vignes de Ratier,90,,Loire Valley,Menetou-Salon,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Henry Pellé
112207,France,"Vacheron are masters of red Sancerre, and this wine lives up to the billing. There are impressively ripe fruits, flavors of the brightest berries and a sweet, pure character, emphasized by the acidity and underlined by wood.",,90,,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Vacheron
112208,US,"Immaculately clean and ripe fruit is on display here, a potpourri of mixed berries. High toned aromas bring in accents of wildflowers, honey and vanilla, continuing into a very pretty finish.",Grand Ciel Vineyard,90,75.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Doyenne
112209,US,"From a single vineyard on Snipes Mountain, this is a forceful, dark and liquorous version of Harrison Hill, which often carries more herbal accents. Here it's fruity and floral, with scents of rose petals and concentrated raspberry and cassis. Still young and showing its alcohol, it needs some hours of decanting.",Harrison Hill,90,75.0,Washington,Snipes Mountain,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,DeLille
112210,Spain,"Full and dark, with aromas of bacon, crusty minerality, black fruits and spice.

112211,Argentina,"Deep as a country well, with lush black plum and blackberry aromas as well as lead pencil and balsam wood. The palate is solid but not overly tough or complex, and the flavors of cassis, berry and black cherry are more than satisfying. A pure, textbook modern red wine; drinkable now and over the next couple of years.",Gran,90,24.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Flechas de los Andes
112212,US,"A lean, steely and slightly herbaceous Chardonnay, whose brisk elegance makes up for the absence of richness.

112213,US,"Made without oak, this wine stars its natural flavors without barrel interference. And what a nice wine it is, with racy acidity and a stony minerality undergirding ripe flavors of lime, pink grapefruit, kiwi, white peach, apricot, chamomile tea and wildflowers. Finishes clean, spicy and wonderfully dry.",,90,25.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Viognier,Ampelos
112214,US,"Stainless steel fermented, this pure varietal is bursting with a tasty fruit bowl mix of apple, pineapple, and Meyer lemon. A hint of mint sneaks in, and the acidity brings bracing minerality to the finish.",,90,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Boomtown
112215,Italy,"Here is a very impressive Rosso di Montalcino with thick, rich concentration and pretty aromas of black fruit, spice and cola. This is more than a “baby Brunello” as Rosso di Montalcino is sometimes called: it's a rich, steady wine that holds its own against some of the better wines of the region. The tannins are tight and firm.",,90,,Tuscany,Rosso di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Il Cocco
112216,Argentina,"A touch leathery and cooked at first, but with time the bouquet deftly blends saucy, savory Syrah aromas with sun-baked black fruit notes.

Drink now through 2012.",San Alberto,90,27.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Syrah,Viña Alicia
112217,Italy,"This is a plump, succulent and sophisticated Rosso di Montalcino that boasts many of the beautiful characteristics of its big brother, Brunello. The tannins are tight and firm and there's a pleasant level of acidity that helps pair the wine to cheese-based pasta dishes.",,90,20.0,Tuscany,Rosso di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Tenuta Vitanza
112218,Italy,"Although this Brunello is from the newly released 2005 vintage, it has aromas and textures that remind you of a wine that is older still. There are sophisticated undertones here of smoke and licorice that peep up from behind candied fruit and black currants. There are also nicely integrated tones of exotic spice and mesquite wood at the back.",,90,,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Sesti
112219,US,"Dark, tannic and full-bodied, this five grape Bordeaux blend from a classic Washington vintage is 100% Alder Ridge fruit. This is a fine effort, cellar-ready and substantial.

Drinkable now and good for another four or five years.",Reserva,90,19.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Beronia
112222,US,"A big wine, full-bodied and ripe, flooding the mouth with jammy raspberries, cherries, vanilla and sweet oak and a combination of all elements that's as rich as white chocolate.

112223,US,"The Boomtown brand from Dusted Valley is quickly becoming one of Walla Walla's best value lineups. This smooth and satiny Cabernet was aged in 50% new oak—mostly French—and has the chocolaty mouthfeel to prove it.

A lot of wine for the price.",,90,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Boomtown
112224,South Africa,"This zippy, fresh sip starts with tropical fruit and citrus aromas, followed by balanced citrus and asparagus flavors. All of it dances on a racy acidity. An elegant, world-class white.",1685,90,16.0,Coastal Region,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Boschendal
112225,Australia,"Full and round in the mouth, this lacks the dynamic purity and luxurious texture of its pricier stablemate, The Duke, but it's still an excellent wine that blends black cherry and strawberry fruit with just a touch of spice. Drink now–2011.",Prodigal,90,30.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Grenache,Kilikanoon
112226,US,"Very rich and voluptuous, with a mouthfeel of pure satin and velvet. Rich and extracted, too, offering a wealth of blackberries, currants, chocolate and pepper. A very tasty wine for drinking soon.",À Côté Santa Barbara Highlands Vineyard,90,24.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,La Fenêtre
112227,US,"When first opened, despite significant bottle age, it's a bit stubborn, tannic, hard, and showing some heat, iron, black olive, and earth. But with aggressive decanting (several hours at least) it begins to flesh out, opens up, and loses its alcoholic edge.",Solesce Red Wine,90,58.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Brian Carter Cellars
112228,US,"This is surprisingly fruit forward for a vintage that is often hard and unyielding. Big, ripe, round flavors of black cherry, plum, cassis and spice fill a round and tasty midpalate. The wine does not extend itself from there; it's content to be a big mouthful of well-ripened fruit.",,90,50.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Browne Family Vineyards
112229,Argentina,"Quite intense, with blasting aromas of blackberry, coconut, cocoa and even leather and horse hide.

Smoky and herbal on the finish.",Salix Vineyard Tannat-Malbec,90,28.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Doña Paula
112230,Australia,"A hint of eucalyptus gives this wine's blackberry fruit a slightly medicinal quality, while black-olive notes provide darkness and depth. The tannins impart a texture somewhere between creamy and silky, remaining somewhat firm on the finish. There is considerable sediment, so decant before serving.",Alexander Munro,88,39.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,Shiraz,Meerea Park
112231,US,"Opens with the sort of sweet/tart impression that a German Kabinett might bring.

112236,Portugal,"A full, weighty, fat wine, almost new world Chardonnay in its texture and richness.

A food white, for good fish dishes, perhaps with spice.",Quinta do Alqueve Fernão Pires,88,10.0,Ribatejo,,,Fernão Pires,Pinhal da Torre

112239,US,"From Boushey and Elerding vineyards, no Washington Sangiovese could ask for a better start. This is 100% varietal, and right away it shows complexity and nuance, mixing spicy berry fruit with hints of citrus and pepper.

112240,US,"Quite an attractive white wine, for its dryness, acidity and overall balance. Fills a real niche in giving us a citrusy, mineral-fresh wine with crisp acidity that will support, not compete with, foods ranging from grilled veggies and goat cheese to firm-fleshed white fish and poultry.",Pierina,88,28.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Vernaccia,Viansa
112241,Italy,This delicately fragrant wine is made from Incrocio Manzoni 6.0.13 grapes (a cross between Pinot Bianco and Riesling).

112242,Germany,"Intensely diesel-like on the nose, almost to the point of nuttiness, then full-bodied, broad and muscular on the palate, delivering flavors of oranges and wet stones.

112243,Italy,"This delivers much more than standard Pinot Grigio. There's thickness and density here all backed by fragrant aromas of stone fruit, citrus and chopped almonds.

112245,Portugal,"From a 73-acre vineyard, owned by Quinta dos Roques, on the slopes of the Serra de Estrella, Portugal's highest mountains.

112249,Portugal,"A ripe and smooth wine, flavored with pears, white peach and spiced with gentle new wood. The touch of minerality comes from the chalk soils of the vineyards. The finish, though, comes back to smoothness, with an edge of acidity.",Ensaios Branco,88,17.0,Beiras,,,Portuguese White,Filipa Pato
112250,US,"A good, sound Zinfandel, although a bit too high in alcohol and soft in structure. But it has pretty flavors of cherries, blackberry cobbler, mocha and pepper, and will happily wash down a nice steak.",Somers Ranch,88,34.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
112251,Argentina,"Interesting floral, herb, cherry and chocolate-mint aromas are a good preview of the racy black cherry and berry flavors that rule the palate.

112252,US,"Marked by acidity and grapeskin bitterness, this is a Pinot Noir to stash in the cellar, in order to let everything resolve. It shows fresh, vibrant flavors of cherries, raspberries and red currants, and is very dry. Should hit its window of opportunity between 2010–2012.",The Ringneck La Encantada,88,49.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Armanino Family Cellars
112253,Argentina,"Alamos takes Merlot to the next level with this ripe, jammy, crusty offering.

112254,US,"A sturdy, substantial, Rhône-inspired red. The goofy name? The winery says it refers to a Celtic people inhabiting the Rhône Valley in the days of the Roman empire. This is tasty juice, tangy and spicy, with sharp pine and herb accents, underscored with wild berry and plenty of acid. The Celts would buy it by the case.",Allobroges,88,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Gilbert Cellars
112255,US,"100% varietal, estate-grown, and aged 20 months in French oak. The nose is dark and laced with ground coffee, earth and dried herb.

112256,Argentina,"This is one of the best—if not the best—yet from this producer.

112259,US,"Firehouse Red is Tamarack's bread-and-butter wine, and rightfully so. Though it's a mélange of Cabernet, Syrah, Merlot, Franc, Malbec and more, it pulls itself into focus with spicy, slightly high-toned fruit, bright and herbal.

112261,Italy,"This 50-50 blend of Montepulciano and Sangiovese shows some Middle Eastern spice aromas as well as a leafy side that conjures aromas of lettuce and spinach.

112263,Chile,"A little funky and loud at first but time reveals dark fruit and roasted earth. Comes on big and ripe in the mouth, with cherry and plum leading the way.

112267,Italy,"Starts out reticent, with hard spice and bramble aromas overriding the fruit. Finds its way later on, as raspberry, strawberry and rhubarb flavors make for a zesty palate.

112270,Australia,"A 70-30 blend of Marsanne and Viognier, the Alliance is an interesting wine but is not one with a lot of concentrated flavor and verve.

112276,US,"Dry, high in acidity nd fiercely clean all the way through the finish, this PG is fruitier than you might expect. Small amounts of Riesling and Tocai Friulano lend flowery citrus notes.

112278,US,"The aim here seems to be to avoid ripe, opulent fruit in favor of an elegantly streamlined wine you might call Chablisian.

112281,US,"Intense in raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors that have a chocolaty edge, this wine also has some raisiny tastes suggesting shriveled or superripe berries, but it maintains essential dryness.

112286,Greece,"Although the oak in this wine has settled, it still coats the mouth with a smooth film. Grape, clay and barnyard aromas lead the way, with more barnyard and berry fruit flavors following. Drink up.",Cava Amethystos,85,30.0,Drama,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Domaine Costa Lazaridi
112287,US,"There's a rusticity here that's partly a function of Zin's wild, brambly nature, and partly due to a raisiny sweet finish. On the plus side is a rich, round mouthfeel and delicious cherry, cranberry and mocha fruit and spice. The September harvest heat wave must have been a huge challenge, even for talented grapegrowers such as the Duttons.",,85,30.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield
112288,US,"This wine is dominated by acids and tannins that numb the mouth, although the blackberry and cherry flavors are so ripely powerful, they come through unscathed. Feels rustic now, but it's thoroughly dry, and could be more interesting in a year or two.",,85,22.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,East Valley
112289,US,"This is a nice, easy-to-like PG. It's crisp in acidity, with forward melon, lemon and lime, and date flavors, and while it's dry, it finishes with a honeyed sweetness. Try with avocado and crab salad or a rich baked ham.",,85,20.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Grigio,Cerro Caliente
112290,US,"This is very full-bodied and tannic, with a dusty astringency that's too young to drink now, but it should age well. Balanced and dry, it has an impressively ripe core of cassis, spicy plums and cherry liqueur that should sweeten when those tannins fall out. Best after 2010.",O.P.C. Claret,92,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Blend,Buoncristiani
112291,US,"This 100% Cabernet is a thick, dense, smoky, chalky, tarry wine with amazing depth and structure. It's big and chewy, and yet still shows excellent definition and even a bit of finesse. Though the tannins are still somewhat raw and chewy, overall this is loaded with such youthful power and flavor that you can forgive a little rough foreplay.",The Bully,92,40.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gorman
112292,Portugal,"Power is the word to describe this wine, with its firm, dark tannins, dusty and solid over brooding heavy fruits. It is perhaps foursquare, and there is a core of dryness.",Quinta da Gricha Vintage,92,,Port,,,Port,Churchill's
112293,Italy,"This  boasts a brilliant ruby color and a very beautiful appearance that is enhanced by its large aromatic offering. Blueberry, raspberry and cherry are backed by roasted nut and spice tones that are generous without being overwhelming. The wine ends with bright fruit flavors and a long finish and can be paired with red meat or game dishes.",Riserva,92,99.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Villa Poggio Salvi
112294,US,"This is a great vineyard that has sourced great Cabs for Terra Valentine. A barrel sample of the '04, tasted more than 2 years ago, showed ageability. Now that it has been released, the wine is still very young and filled with potential. Thick in black currants, cherries and oak, it needs much more time. Best after 2010.",Wurtele Vineyard,92,58.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Terra Valentine
112295,Italy,"It's safe to say that Gianfranco Soldera's style is only appreciated and understood by Brunello purists. The wines are as thorny and complex as the argumentative, cantankerous man who makes them. For one, this wine has big volatility but the magic here is that those pungent direct aromas translate into bright aromatic vibrancy and buoyancy. In fact, its intensity and the careful balance between acidity and structure is unmatched.",Case Basse,92,293.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Soldera
112296,New Zealand,"Saint Clair's Reserve and single-block bottlings are consistently top-notch, and this concentrated Sauvignon maintains that tradition. Scents of fresh herbs, nectarine and pineapple give way to intense flavors of stone fruit. It's medium- to full-bodied, with a long finish that's fresh without being overly herbal. Drink through the end of 2008.",Wairau Reserve,92,27.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Saint Clair
112297,Chile,"For a first vintage out of northerly Limarí Valley, this Concha y Toro effort from winemaker Marcelo Papa exceeds any reasonable expectations. It's an exotic, unique version of perfectly ripe, healthy Syrah from a perfect Chilean vintage. It steamrolls with maxed-out wild berry fruit, a saturated feel and backbone. Enjoy now and over the next few years.",Reserva Especial,92,20.0,Limarí Valley,,,Syrah,Maycas del Limari
112298,Italy,"With this thick, inky wine Mauro Vannucci proves his extraction expertise. The nose offers chocolate fudge, smoky vanilla, roasted coffee bean and succulent red fruit. Leather and tobacco linger in the background. There's a finely textured quality to the tannins and toasted flavors linger long on the palate.",Piaggia Il Sasso,92,,Tuscany,Carmignano,,Red Blend,Mauro Vannucci
112299,Australia,"This wine is rapidly becoming a favorite for its unique combination of peppery meatiness with mixed blueberry and blackberry fruit. It's complex and compelling, with hints of coffee, tar and black olive all adding to the array of aromas and flavors. Long and richly tannic on the finish; while this is approachable now, it should also stand up to 10 years' cellaring. Imported by Epic Wines.",Reserve,92,45.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,Shiraz-Viognier,Yering Station
112300,Chile,"Intense and dark, with an oily nose of mineral, leather and mocha along with ripe berry fruit notes. The blend (50% Carmenère, 40% Cab Sauvignon, 10% Syrah), works like a charm. The flavors settle on lightly herb-infused berry flavors and chocolate, while the finish is on the spot. Rich, ripe and with modest tannins; drink now–2009.",,91,55.0,Maipo Valley,,,Red Blend,Antiyal
112301,US,"Acorn has produced one of their best bottlings ever. The wine is drily crisp and tannic, but rich and supple, with cassis, cherry and carob flavors that have an earthy, mushroom and tobacco grounding. The wine contains smaller amounts of at least 10 other varieties, in the manner of an old field blend.",Alegria Vineyards Heritage Vines,91,34.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Acorn
112302,Australia,"The 2005 Inkwell wines are undeniably big, but they manage to carry their weight and ample alcohol levels with a surprising measure of balance and grace. This one clocks in at 15.7%, but doesn't seem hot or heavy, just mouthfilling and round. Blueberry and blackberry fruit lead the way, but they're joined by earthier notes of black olive, coffee and tree bark. Drink now–2010.",Wild Thing,91,20.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Inkwell
112303,US,"A tannic, brambly, earthy wine, this pure Red Mountain Syrah was kept in neutral oak and minimally racked. At first it shows a tart and chalky character; then there begins to emerge lovely concentrated black cherry and loganberry fruit, along with a backbone of ash, graphite and coffee. On the second day it has softened and expanded with an engaging mix of fruit, herb, pepper and Red Mountain rock.",The Pixie,91,35.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Gorman
112304,US,"This Bordeaux blend is a powerful, dark, earthy wine, scented with Bordeaux-like forest floor, herb and fungus. It's the sort of Cabernet that is not afraid of the grape's true varietal character, and promises to age beautifully. Right now it would need some considerable airing to show its best, but the compact and intriguing finish, with its panorama of earth, green and black tea, spice and cassis, is well worth the wait.",L'Etalon,91,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Brian Carter Cellars
112305,Italy,"Sangiovese's naturally warm, earthy tones come straight at you and are surrounded by a pretty frame of red fruit, almond, red apple, plump berry and pipe tobacco. This is a distinctive, unique wine that boasts an individual personality and solid roots in Brunello tradition. It has chewy tannins, delicate flavors and a refreshing, long-lasting finish.",Annata,91,149.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Biondi Santi
112306,US,"The fruit is perfectly ripe and succulent, a juicy mix of berries and black cherries. It's set against firm but ripe and polished tannins, which provide muscle and add some spice as well. The oak contributes just the right level of toast, not too heavy. The exceptional, sweet and tasty fruit takes the center stage, while the pretty oak flavors do the final curtain call.",,91,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Franc,Barrister
112307,US,"This classy Walla Walla Syrah is still young and tightly wound, with juicy acids and flavors of tart berry and wild mountain fruit. As it opens in the glass it starts to show smoked ham and bacon, with black pepper in the back. Tannins are chewy and right on the border between green and black tea, but the bright raspberry fruit shines through. It's got good, crunchy structure and a substantial finish.",,91,29.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Beresan
112308,Chile,"All this Cab blend needs is time in the glass and it'll show floral, alluring aromas and then big raspberry and plum flavors. It starts quietly and then pounds through with saturated fruit, chocolate and firm tannins.",Sideral,91,30.0,Rapel Valley,,,Cabernet Blend,Altaïr
112309,US,"This wine is compact, vertically structured and dense with black cherry, cassis, licorice, smoke and graphite. Still quite young, it's chewy and rough through the finish.

112310,Chile,"Café mocha is the first aroma, and that's backed by char, pepper, smoldering black fruit and earth, the sum of which gears you up for the palate, which is healthy but not too fierce or tannic. Flavors of berry and cassis are natural and juicy, while the finish is long and brings in tobacco and leather notes. Drink now through 2010.",Ninquén Mountain Vineyard,91,34.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ninquén
112311,Italy,"Cometa boasts a brilliant, saturated golden color and carries through with clean execution in terms of aromas and flavors. Notes of tropical fruit and ripe citrus come into sharp focus thanks to Fiano's natural minerality. In the mouth, it offers plenty of weight, but balances that with great length on the finish, hinting at anise, honey, limes and oranges.",Cometa,91,39.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Fiano,Planeta
112312,Australia,"Assertively toasty and nutty, this is barrel-fermented in new oak, but in 500-liter puncheons, not the smaller barriques, so that the wood doesn't overwhelm. Peach, vanilla and citrus flavors completely fill the mouth, yet remain fresh and vibrant on the finish. Drink now–2012. Imported by Epic Wines.",Reserve,91,45.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,Chardonnay,Yering Station

Drink it now and over the next several years. Imported by Epic Wines.",Reserve,91,45.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,Pinot Noir,Yering Station
112314,Portugal,"Soft in texture yet mouthcoating in its intensity, this is a honeyed, nutty wine filled with dried fruit, toffee and almond butter aromas and flavors. Like all tawnies, it won't improve with bottle age, so drink this while your young vintage Ports hog the cellar space.",20 Year Old Tawny,91,50.0,Port,,,Port,Dow's
112315,New Zealand,"This wine combines complexity and an appealingly gentle texture to make for a compelling whole.

Drink now–2012.",Te Muna Road Vineyard,91,45.0,Martinborough,,,Pinot Noir,Craggy Range

112317,Italy,"Sophisticated and well-executed, with a dark, almost impenetrable consistency that has been enhanced by two years in oak barrique.

112318,Chile,"Some of the best-bred Carmenères in the world are grown in Peumo, and a star example is this saturated, minty wine with medium-weight tannins and a long finish.

112319,US,"Once again, this bottling delivers a big, lush, complex and succulent young wine for Zin specialist Bella.

112321,Argentina,"Chakana has put out many good wines in recent vintages but this rough and tumble blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah  comes across minty and forced on the nose and then grating on the palate. Yes, it's got color and power. But it lacks the balance and body that you'd expect. Frankly, it seems acidified.",Estate Selection,84,35.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Red Blend,Chakana
112322,Croatia,"Grown only in Croatia, the Zlahtina grape is light, refreshing and redolent of lemon and citrus—akin to a Sauvignon Blanc.

112324,US,"Even at nearly 5 years of age, Pietra Santa's is still drily tannic, giving it a puckery astringency.

112326,Spain,"If you catch this wine young and properly chilled, it isn't that bad. It's very sweet and sugary, with candied melon, mango and citrus flavors.

On the verge of tasting fake but not quite.",Satinela Medium-Sweet,84,9.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
112327,Romania,"A soft, integrated nose of red berry, spice and some smoke leads on this Merlot from Romania. The berry and spice flavors are slightly angular with a sweet, wooded finish, and the tannins pronounced. A mildly rustic Merlot that could use some aging or a good piece of meat to temper the edge.",Villa Zorilor Lady Gabriela Private Reserve,84,20.0,Dealu Mare,,,Merlot,VinArte
112328,Romania,"Cigar, mocha and gamy spice start this Merlot from Romania, and on the palate, it's slightly spiky and needs more integration. Overall, though, warming spices and appealing fruit flavors save the day.",Villa Zorilor Assolato,84,17.0,Dealu Mare,,,Merlot,VinArte
112329,Australia,"A good wine...but disappointing given the high quality of the winery's Chardonnay. This is a plump, medium-bodied Pinot with a somewhat coarse texture and rather simple sour-cherry flavors.",,84,48.0,Victoria,Mornington Peninsula,,Pinot Noir,Yabby Lake Vineyard

112332,Greece,"This Xinomavro, with its compelling nose of coffee, cinnamon spice and olive, has a rough character that both distinguishes it (showing its Greek blood) and makes it tough to embrace.

112333,Spain,"Hot and earthy, with herbal aromas sitting in front of a hard, grabby palate. The flavors show more plum skin and sourness than sweet, ripe juice. Hence the wine is narrow and fairly astringent. On the plus side, it seems natural and typical for what Cariñena produces.",No. IV,83,22.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Red Blend,Gabarda

112336,Italy,"There's a meaty, pulpy quality to this sparkler and its aromas of mature fruit (with some distant sulfur) suggest sourcing from a hotter climate area. It performs well in the mouth with a hint of chewy sweetness on the finish.",Brut,83,10.0,Veneto,Prosecco del Veneto,,Prosecco,Bellussi
112337,Italy,"The sparkling wine opens with luminous perlage but the nose is a bit thorny and pungent with aromas of almond, peanut and pear that tickle the nose.

112338,Argentina,"More chunky than some in its class, with early berry flavors but not much backing that up. The wine has a little brett and rubber, and in the end it turns lean and tight. Fresh but too sharp and thin to raise the bar.",,83,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Andean Sky
112339,Croatia,"This Croatian Pinot Gris is easy and likable, with its citric, spicy nose and simple, balanced flavors of spice, citrus and steely minerality. Fresh and fun, the wine will pair well with salads, seafood and spicy Asian cuisine.",,83,,Kutjevo,,,Pinot Gris,Krauthaker
112340,Italy,"This is a broad, rich Prosecco Extra Dry that boasts a darker, more saturated color and mature notes of fruit and peach backed by honey and fruit pulp.

112341,US,"An awkward wine, with some delicious blackberry and cherry flavors, but also some green ones that give an asparagus, minty note. The wine is structurally fine, but those unripe tastes are a turn-off.",Wheelhouse,83,20.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Sextant
112342,Italy,"Despite its beautiful, luminous appearance, the nose of this Prosecco Brut is accented by a slightly pungent tone of almond skin or peanut that almost completely blows away with time. It is a streamlined, compact sparkler with crisp lime on the close.",Brut,83,19.0,Veneto,Prosecco di Valdobbiadene,,Prosecco,Varaschin
112343,Argentina,"A thick wine that doesn't bring the ripeness, sweetness and balance that's necessary. The nose is filled with milk chocolate, mint and cough syrup, while the palate is surprisingly tangy and sharp, with cranberry and wild raspberry flavors.",,83,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,St. Lucas
112344,Italy,"Simple and very neutral, this Prosecco Frizzante offers less effervescence and sparkling intensity, perhaps because the bottle is closed with a traditional cork instead of a pressurized cork and cage. It almost seems like a still wine.",Frizzante,83,12.0,Veneto,Prosecco del Veneto,,Prosecco,Giovello
112345,US,"Burgundian technique was used in this wine, and the aromas and tastes of those techniques dominate.

112350,US,"Dry and elegant, not really a rich wine, but a well-structured one. It has keen acids and dusty tannins that frame cola and root beer flavors.

112352,Australia,"Nicely complex, this offering combines cherry fruit with plenty of leathery, smoky and herbal nuances. In fact, one might argue there's a touch too much leather, as it seems to dull the fruit slightly, smoothing out any rough edges, but also lessening the fruit's bite. The wine is medium-bodied, with a creamy mouthfeel that finishes on a leathery note.",Benjamin's Promise,87,40.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,David Franz
112353,New Zealand,"Smoky, earthy and cola-scented, this is a soft, plushly textured wine that's not very fruity, yet features ample flesh in the form of earth, mushroom, spice and cola. Seems mature, so drink now.",,87,25.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Blind Trail

112355,Spain,"Red fruit is the focus of this zesty, rugged Tempranillo-based wine. The palate is lively and acidic, as plum and berry flavors get lots of boost.

112356,Spain,"Hay, corn and buttered toast are the initial aromas, and soon after the wine settles into a pretty good groove.

112359,US,"This hasn't been my favorite Testarossa Pinot, although it's a very good one. It's a big, ripe wine, possibly ageworthy, with exuberant cherry, raspberry and new oak flavors. It has a gritty tannin structure that contributes to a slightly rustic mouthfeel.",Brosseau Vineyard,87,54.0,California,Chalone,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
112360,Spain,"A wave of pleasant but light cherry, blackberry and sage offers a powerful but not overpowering opening.

112361,US,"Powerful aromatics lead to powerful fruity flavors in this Rhône-style wine.

112363,Spain,"Warm and the slightest bit raisiny, but overall it's a bright, fruity blend of Monastrell and Tempranillo that's tasty and worth every dollar.

This one will please Rosenblum's many fans.",Hillside Vineyards,87,25.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Syrah,Rosenblum
112365,US,"Bold and direct, this wine appeals for its fruity flavors and dry balance.

It has an evolved nose of aged cheese, earth, stem and tobacco, with some fruit to spare. Fairly light for a Cabernet, it maintains healthy, yet dusty, tannins supporting barnyard, leather, brown spice and chewing tobacco flavors. The fruit has gone, but what remains is an interesting, complex wine with good intensity.",Collection Cabernet,86,23.0,Moldova,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cricova
112369,US,"A soft, voluptuous Merlot. The velvety texture frames ripe, juicy blackberry, cherry jam and milk chocolate flavors, with a flowery, violet note. But the wine is too soft, and the tannins melted.",Mitsuko's Vineyard,86,25.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Merlot,Clos Pegase
112370,US,"This is a dark, powerful rosé, almost a red wine, with the weight and silky texture of a light Pinot Noir. But the flavors are all Grenache, namely, cherries, cherries, cherries. It's a dry wine, with a long, rich, spicy finish.",Grenache Rosé,86,14.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Grenache,Epiphany
112371,Italy,"Here's a pale, straw-colored sparkler with such decisive aromatic intensity, it borders on being pungent. Notes of melon, apricot and yellow flower are delivered in a direct, vertical manner. The wine is crisp, but very tender on the tongue.",,86,10.0,Veneto,Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene,,Prosecco,Conte Collalto
112372,US,"Superripe, a Zin with a soft, thick texture and almost desserty flavors of chocolate soufflé infused with crème de cassis and cherry jam. It's probably technically dry, but leaves behind a sweet aftertaste.",PoiZin,86,25.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Armida
112373,US,"This is a ripely fruity wine with a dollop of French oak that's a textbook example of Lodi. Soft in acids, with powerful tropical fruit, nectarine, peach, pear and apple flavors, it offers clean, easy drinking.",,86,17.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Chardonnay,7 Heavenly Chards
112374,US,"Now that they're no longer making only bubbly, the winery is trying to identify block selections of dry Pinot Noir. Give them some time.

112376,US,"Jammy, grapey and fresh, with blackberry and cherry flavors that taste right out of the fermenter. Richness comes from notes of coffee, leather and spice. So easy to imagine drinking this wine with a cheeseburger.",,86,13.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Syrah,Liberty School
112377,US,"A bit on the simple side, but likeable for its cherry pie filling, blackberry jam, cola and spicy coffee fruit that fill the mouth with flavor. Thoroughly dry, the wine is elegantly smooth and balanced. Drink now.",,86,32.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Longboard
112378,Greece,"The nose starts a bit funky and earthy, but clears to reveal scents of  blueberry pie and grape jelly. Full in the mouth, it has a soft, smooth feel with acidity to give it a lift. The blueberry compote flavors are a bit hidden by heavy tannins, but drink this with a steak or rack of lamb and watch the tannins melt away.",Lion d'Or,86,15.0,Greece,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Nico Lazaridi
112379,US,"An interesting wine that depends on the right food matching to succeed. It's dryish to honeyed, and enormously ripe and fruity, with apricot, nectarine, pineapple, jasmine, honeysuckle and all kinds of Asian spice flavors.

112381,Italy,"Tight as nails on the nose before it explodes on the palate in a cacophony of cherry, cassis, black plum, tobacco and chocolate. It's like the best cigar and a great red wine rolled into one. Yes, the tannins are hammering and yes, the acidity is forward. But that only means this brilliant Brunello should age for 15 years without batting an eyelash.

112382,Italy,"Fresh asphalt, burning timber, bitter chocolate, and anything else that connotes “darkness” is what this heavyweight is about. And as rough as that may sound aromatically, on the palate it's polished like a gemstone, with just enough grit and guts to push it forward. The fruit, meanwhile, is sensational, a panoply of black plums and cherries infused with cocoa and vanilla. This offers a clear look into 21st-century Brunello, and the picture is breathtaking. Imported by Vinifera Imports.",Madonna del Piano Riserva,97,130.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Valdicava
112383,Italy,"A gorgeous wine with amazing texture and integration. The nose and feel are so soft and silky, and the fruit is as expressive as Sangiovese gets.

112384,Italy,"Darker, richer and earthier than Gaja's Barbaresco, picking up notes of coffee, vanilla and toast as well. Yet on the palate there's wonderfully bright cherry-raspberry fruit and masses of lush, velvety tannins that will give this wine plenty of life in the cellar. Drink 2012–2030.",Costa Russi,95,350.0,Piedmont,Langhe,,Red Blend,Gaja
112385,Italy,"Perhaps less nuanced than the Sorì Tildìn, but more powerful, with round, mouthfilling flavors and firm tannins.

Drink 2015–2030 and beyond.",Sorì San Lorenzo,95,350.0,Piedmont,Langhe,,Red Blend,Gaja
112386,Italy,"Saturated to the max, with a violet/ruby tint that shows no breaks. If it looks like an extracted bruiser, it is. The tannins are big and precise, however, they aren't aggressive or mean. In a fine-tuned cellar this will come around in about five years to show amazing black cherry and plum fruit, and lots of style. Imported by Supreme Wines & Spirits.",Riserva,95,65.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Donatella Cinelli Colombini
112387,Italy,"Filled with intoxicating perfume reminiscent of dried spices, fine leather, exotic woods, then delivers bold black cherry, plum and Asian spice flavors tightly wrapped in a velvety blanket of tannin.

112388,Italy,"Here's a huge, stately wine with a brick-based structure and mounds of lovely oak that is already so well integrated you barely notice it. Quite tannic, and will require come cellaring. When you do drink it, expect warm flavors, liqueur-soaked berry fruit and a mile-long finish. Hold until 2010, at least. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.",Riserva,95,125.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Poggio Antico
112389,Italy,"Lots of spice, with black pepper and leather notes leading the way, followed by a core of plum, black cherry and earth flavors.

112390,Italy,"Smooth and lush, with a ton of berry, cherry and smoke character. Supremely ripe and full, with chocolate and spice mixed into the prime cherry/berry palate. This is a wine for anyone who simply loves wine; maybe it isn't ultra-complex but there's no arguing about its polish and style. It's incredibly round and likable. Imported by Banfi Vintners.",Poggio All'Oro Riserva,94,150.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Castello Banfi
112391,Italy,"Strong as a cement block, with aromas of charcoal, leather and intense plum/berry. Still, in the mouth it's luscious. In addition, there's a sublime spice element playing in the background that only makes it more complete. Finishes with the essence of fruit cake and marzipan. A pleasure. Imported by Paterno Wines International.",Riserva,94,80.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Il Poggione
112392,Italy,"Pure violet in color, with a nose packed full of creamy oak, sweet plum and blackberry. This is your prototypical modern-day bruiser. The palate offers a powder keg of sweet, chewy fruit, yet the acidity is right there corralling it all. Properly applied oak cuddles rather than overwhelms the fruit, while the full tannins make it a lion heart. Fabulous for a 2000 normale. Imported by Summa Vitis, Inc.",,94,,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,La Serena
112393,Italy,"Wonderfully toasted up front, with baked, but not cooked, fruit aromas. There's also plenty of coffee, earth and leather to the bouquet. Initial live-wire flavors settle to reveal marzipan and dried stone fruits, while the sly finish is so complex that the wine ultimately registers as a different breed. Drinking this is like navigating a maze. A Marc de Grazia Selection, various importers.",Riserva,94,90.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Uccelliera
112394,Italy,"Elegantly perfumed, with touches of cinnamon, ground pepper, and dusty earth accenting notes of black cherries and chocolate. On the palate, there's powerful plum and black cherry flavors, but also a strong minerality that adds an extra dimension to this compelling wine. Soft enough to begin drinking around 2010, it should keep for a couple of decades after that.",Conteisa,94,205.0,Piedmont,Langhe,,Red Blend,Gaja
112395,US,"A great Cab showcasing everything good about Napa's fabulous '01 Cabs. It's rich, vibrant and complex, with layers of cassis, cocoa and roasted coffee flavors, and a deft touch of smoky oak. The tannins are sweet, ripe and subtle. Doesn't clobber you sideways with fruit, but offers elegant, sophisticated drinking.",Reserve,93,107.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chimney Rock
112396,Italy,"Pitch black, like midnight on a country road. Talk about saturated: the nose yields tar, char and more, and in the mouth it has that midlevel intensity that many of the 2000s don't have. Earthy at one moment, polished the next. It finishes with a sweet blast of molasses, black cherry and coffee. A head-turner, one that gets better with every sip. Imported by Vinifera Imports.",,93,89.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Valdicava
112397,US,"Fairly oaky, but in between the wood grain are aromas of stone-encrusted peach and pungent citrus. A model fumé-style wine that will suit grilled shrimp or lobster like a fine-fitting suit. The flavors of lemon curd, grapefruit and pineapple are rock solid, while the feel from front to back is ideal.",To Kalon Vineyard Reserve,93,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Fumé Blanc,Robert Mondavi
112398,US,"Stunning concentration and intensity in this Syrah, which is a blend of Rosella's and Paraiso fruit. Offers huge flavors of chocolate, blueberry, cassis, flowers and minerals. Lush and dense; flatters now, but should soften for some years.",Tierra Mar,93,35.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Syrah,Morgan
112399,Italy,"Big and brawny, with a blinding violet color and a bouquet bursting with rich oak. In fact, this wine features as much new oak as any normale on the market. But with such quality fruit, the nose quickly morphs into high-grade tobacco and pure vanilla. In the mouth, things run deep and thick, and any potential corpulence is balanced by ripe tannins and fresh acids. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.",,93,72.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Poggio Antico
112400,Italy,"Despite starting out a bit mute, what lurks below is nothing short of stellar. Fine black licorice and ripe, meaty fruit creates a dark, manly flavor profile, while the finish deals a layer cake's worth of fudge, vanilla and espresso. Virtually anything you would want in a Brunello is here. Imported by Lauber Imports.",Riserva,93,60.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Marchesato degli Aleramici
112401,Italy,Surprisingly sweet but lovable just the same. The nose offers sugared doughnut and marzipan aromas yet the palate has cut-through acidity that ensures that the wine is neither flabby nor dull.

112402,Italy,"This winery is always at the top of the heap, and it's 2000 shows true depth of flavor, texture and nuance. Seemingly approachable now, with classy plum and berry aromas and flavors. Softening any astringency is vanilla and tobacco, while a distant shot of citrus adds life. The whole speaks louder than the parts; a super overall package. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.",,93,74.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Fuligni
112403,US,"A deeply satisfying and intense Chard, for its wealth of well-ripened tropical fruit, pear, key lime pie, vanilla and toast flavors and the refreshing acidity that makes the wine clean and lively. The long, complete finish is impressive. Defines the sunshine and chill of its appellation.",Corral Vineyard,93,32.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse
112404,Italy,"Smoky and dark, with potent char and tar elements to the bouquet. Look for sweet cherry and plum flavors floating on a bed of soft, smooth tannins.

Imported by Star Industries Inc.",Riserva,93,70.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,La Fortuna
112405,Argentina,"A serious wine for serious wine drinkers. It's 60% Cabernet and the rest Malbec. Deep, deep and deeper is how to best describe the chewy, fruit-saturated palate, but even better, this wine has guts, balance and aging capacity. Best to hold this joint-venture red from Chateau Cheval-Blanc and Terrazas de Los Andes for at least three years.",,93,75.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec,Cheval des Andes
112406,Italy,"This perennial stud struts its stuff once again. Smoke, spice and red-fruit aromas are perfectly interwoven, while the wine itself flows with agile zest. Maybe it doesn't have the layering of the amazing '99, but it's gargantuan on the midpalate and the finish is exotic as it deals nutmeg, marzipan, chocolate, cassis and mint. A proverbial kitchen-sink wine worthy of its reputation. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",,93,75.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Siro Pacenti
112407,US,"I have watched this wine for some time and know that it is an ager, especially in a great vintage like this one. Made from very high Mayacamas Mountain grapes, it's relentlessly tannic in its youth. But the core of black cherry and cassis is fabulous. Hold until 2010.",Christopher's,93,80.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet
112408,Argentina,"Saturated in color. Smells rugged, like tire rubber and tar mixed with blackberry. Beautiful tasting, with black cherry, licorice and minerality on a firm, no-flab palate.

112409,Italy,"Kicks off with a lot of maple, coffee and espresso, and in the mouth the tannins are spiky and aggressive. Nonetheless, there's dynamite classic fruit here and structure to burn.

112411,Argentina,"Once you cut through the heavy, minty oak, there's a decent wine hiding in the folds.

112414,Argentina,"This colorful, clumsy wine shows glaring powdered-drink and candied cherry aromas and flavors, and while it's kind of scouring and rough it manages to make its mark via its juicy ripeness.

112420,Argentina,"Holds it together for the most part, but this isn't what you'd call a focused or interesting wine.

112422,US,"Ballentine continues to struggle with this bottling. It's more balanced than the '02, but still has a harsh, baked quality to the cherry-berry fruit. That accentuates the tannins, which feel hard and astringent.",Pocai Vineyard,83,22.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Ballentine

112424,Argentina,"Most of Bousquet's wines are enigmatic. They show some good qualities but also signs of overcropping and underripeness.

112426,Argentina,"Can't say that the heavy dose of oak on this wine is helping the cause.

112429,US,"Really not a very likeable Syrah despite some tasty cherry fruit flavors. The problem is enormously high alcohol, 15.9%, that makes the wine hot, and a near absence of acidity, which makes it cloying.

112451,US,"Gentle, smooth and flavorful, this Zin has polished berry, cherry, cocoa and spice flavors that finish long and spicy. It has an elegant, silky texture and isn't very tannic.",Estate,86,12.0,California,El Dorado,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Sierra Vista
112452,US,"Shows much the same character as Don Sebastiani's 2004 Pepperwood Grove Merlot, perhaps a touch more tannic, and veering more toward blackberries instead of cherries. Still it's a lovely sipper, fresh and jammy.",,86,9.0,California,California,California Other,Merlot,Smoking Loon
112453,US,"Made in a very ripe, extracted style, this eccentric wine has flavors of apricots, or more precisely, apricot marmalade on buttered toast, because it's also oaky. It's dry and crisp in acids. A bit unusual, but in its own way, a good wine.",Mills Vineyard,86,20.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,River Road
112454,US,"This is a powerfully fruity wine, packed with very ripe blackberry, black cherry, coffee and sweet leather flavors, in a fairly tannic package. It finishes a bit sweet, but shows good control throughout.",Vidmar Vineyard,86,32.0,California,Yorkville Highlands,North Coast,Syrah,A Donkey and Goat
112455,US,"Herbal flavors descend into stemminess, with the aggressive tannins swamping the fruit. The finish is hard, earthy and tasting of green tea.",Reserve,86,30.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Belle Vallée
112456,Germany,"Founded in 1794, Deinhard is an old merchant house—what the French would call a négociant—that markets a wide array of wines. The company's 1808 price list offered 89 different Rhine and Mosel wines, but that's been at least somewhat shortened in recent years. No, it's not that intense, nor does it show a lot of minerality, but this wine ably shows off Mosel Riesling's array of fruity, off-dry flavors, ranging from peach and pear to apple, pineapple and lime. Crisp and clean on the finish.",Piesporter QbA,86,8.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Deinhard
112457,US,"Tannic and tough now, with a sandpapery mouthfeel, this Cab has flavors of blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit. It's bone dry, with good acidity. Hard to tell where it's going. Probably best now and for the next five years.",Reserve,86,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Merryvale
112458,Chile,"A touch sweet and syrupy, with a hint of molasses and raisin on the nose. The mouth deals big cassis, raspberry and cherry flavors, while the solid finish offers chocolate and a whiff of toast. Yourthful and forward; drink now and enjoy. Imported by Morande USA.",,86,8.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Morandé
112459,Germany,"Lacks the layered intensity that the 2003 version of this wine showed at this stage, but still delivers stony, minerally aromas and prototypical flavors of green apples and fresh limes. Light in body, but clean and wonderfuly refreshing on the finish. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Trittenheimer Apotheke Spätlese,86,31.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Grans-Fassian
112460,New Zealand,"A bright and bouncy Merlot, with charming cherry flavors accented by hints of tobacco, cinnamon and clove. A dollop of Malbec (15%) contributes acidity and spice. Imported by Total Beverage Solution.",Distinction,86,14.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Merlot,Kemblefield
112461,New Zealand,"Starts off with lovely rose petal and spice aromas, then delivers broad, mouthfilling flavors without being heavy. On the dry side for NZ Gewürz; finishes clean but a bit short. Imported by Total Beverage Solution.",Distinction,86,14.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Gewürztraminer,Kemblefield
112462,New Zealand,"Combines dusky peach and passion fruit aromas and flavors in a wine that's a bit softer and sweeter-tasting than many Marlborough Sauvignon Blancs, yet still carries a refreshing touch of acid on the finish. Imported by New Zealand Wine Imports.",,86,17.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Framingham
112463,New Zealand,"Produced from ""cordon-cut"" bunches, Riesling offers up intense honey, apple and pear aromas and flavors. With more than 11% residual sugar, you might expect this wine to be sticky-sweet, but thanks to crisp acids, it's not cloying. Tasty, well-balanced wine that just finishes a bit short.",Desert Gold Late Harvest,86,,Central Otago,,,Riesling,Olssens
112464,New Zealand,"Light in weight despite nearly 2% residual sugar, this nice, easy-drinking Gewürz features varietally correct aromas and flavors of roses, lychees and spice. Imported by Robert Whale Selections Inc.",,86,,Nelson,,,Gewürztraminer,Seifried
112465,US,"Made in a very dry and acidic style, this wine has flavors of limes, honeydew melons and buttercream. It's tight and minerally, with a tart, high-acid finish, and seems designed to complement food.",Hopkins Vineyard,86,17.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,River Road
112466,New Zealand,"A pungent, grassy wine, layered with green pepper and herbal notes. Leaner than most 2005 Marlborough Sauvignons, finishing with sharp strokes of lime and grapefruit. Imported by Paterno Wines International.",,86,19.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Wairau River
112467,Chile,"Not that packed or forward, but still quite good in its territory. The nose shows light cherry, while the palate is fairly savory, with berry flavors touched up by a shot of vanilla. A bit short on the finish and not that full in the middle, but for $8 what more do you want? Imported by GWFC-Gourmet Wine & Food Co.",Estate,86,8.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Viu Manent
112468,US,"Has everything the best Chards have, without quite the same complexity or depth, of course. But's it's a value for the rich pear, peach and pineapple flavors, creamy smooth texture, and sumptuous overlay of oak.",,86,11.0,California,California,California Other,Chardonnay,Montage
112469,New Zealand,"Shows some pleasant dark toasty aromas to go with its pretty blackberry flavors, but this lacks texture and weight in the mouth. Crisp on the finish.",Matheson,86,,Hawke's Bay,,,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,Matua Valley
112470,US,"Rough and ready, but decent in berry-cherry fruit, with easy tannins. This is an everyday Cab with lots of good qualities.",,84,15.0,California,California,California Other,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau St. Jean
112471,Italy,Shows decent varietal character in its crisp chocolate and black cherry aromas and flavors. Also boasts a slight nuttiness that winemaker Calogero Statella calls “hazelnut”—a character he attributes to Nero d'Avola grown in the southwestern portion of Sicily.,,84,7.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Nero d'Avola,Feudo Arancio
112472,US,"Slightly sweet but crisp in acids, this pleasant wine features citrus, fig, tobacco and vanilla flavors.",,84,14.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Alderbrook
112473,US,"Lots of ripe berry and spice flavors in this dry, friendly wine. It's very soft, but has good acidity. Try with BBQ salmon or ribs.",,84,8.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Zinfandel,Talus
112474,US,"At 5 years, this wine remains tannic, with modest blackberry and oak flavors. Turns dry and astringent on the finish, and not likely to go anywhere, but it's okay.",Bodacious,84,30.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,Toad Hall
112475,Chile,"Soft and flabby on the nose, with heavy berry syrup aromas. The palate is more red-fruit dominant, with plum and raspberry. Good zip and acidity, with a hint of buttery oak on the finish.",,84,8.0,Central Valley,,,Shiraz,Terra Andina
112476,Chile,"Lots of tobacco, green bean and berry fruit work the nose, followed by syrupy but standard red-fruit flavors on the tongue. Plum, fudge and astringent tannins make for a mouthfeel that's at once soft but also hard.",Castillo De Molina Reserva,84,10.0,Lontué Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,San Pedro
112477,France,"A bit overdone, with aromas of leather and prune and flavors of molasses. Still, it's not as heavy as it sounds, and it finishes with some chalky tannins, so it does have some structure. Try with beef stew.",Prestige,84,12.0,Rhône Valley,Costières de Nîmes,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Château de Valcombe
112478,France,"Smells really nice, with bubbly Grenache fruit making a strong statement on the nose, but falls off a bit on the palate. Ripe and pleasant, bursting with black cherry fruit, just lacking concentration and length.",,84,8.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes-du-Ventoux,,Red Blend,La Vieille Ferme
112479,US,"Shows nice berry and earth flavors, with Zin's brambly edge, and finishes dry and balanced. The texture is soft.",Branham Rockpile,84,32.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Galleron
112480,Chile,"Rubbery red fruit carries the commonplace nose, followed by flavors of cherry, berry and spice. And while it seems soft at first, time allows for the tannins to pile up and become hard.",,84,16.0,Molina,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Echeverria
112481,France,"Fresh and crisp, this is a wine which has fine acidity. It has an earthy, barnyard element which gives it weight and fatness.",,84,13.0,Rhône Valley,Crozes-Hermitage,,Marsanne,Cave de Tain
112482,US,"A soft, gentle, easy Merlot, with cherry-cocoa flavors. It's dry and balanced.",,84,19.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Merlot,Cinnabar
112483,US,"So deficient in lively acidity that it just collapses on the palate, making it hard to appreciate the pretty flavors of dry, tart cherries and espresso. Just disappears on the finish.",Heritage,84,36.0,California,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Petite Sirah,Concannon
112484,Chile,"Tight and lemony, with sharp citrus aromas along with flavors of orange and other citrus fruits. Offers some texture and body, with freshness.",,84,7.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Conde de Velázquez

112487,France,"Nice clean nose, with scents of cherries and white pepper. But what are the green, stemmy flavors doing on the palate? Modest cherry fruit, but this medium-bodied wine finishes herbal and astringent.",,83,15.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Luberon,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Château la Canorgue
112488,US,"Good, rich flavors, ranging from blackberries and dried herbs to bitter espresso, but way too soft. Like a Dali watch, it just melts without coming to life.",Selected Vineyards,83,12.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Petite Sirah,Concannon
112489,US,"There's good, ripe fruit flavor here, but the wine hits the mouth with a raw feeling. Finishes sharp and disagreeably harsh.",Ultra Violet,83,26.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Merlot,Casa de Caballos
112490,US,"The price is right, but this wine is rather skimpy in fruit, over-oaked and too sweet.",,83,10.0,California,Santa Barbara,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Meridian
