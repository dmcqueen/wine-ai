49998,US,"An elegant Viognier, this first release from a young Lake Chelan vineyard has unusual delicacy for this often-bitter grape. At a moderate 13% alcohol, it shows lemon and lime rind, pink grapefruit and just a hint of white peach flavors. It finishes dry, and despite its lightness, it has a nice grip and persistence through the finish as well as firm acidity. Could be a gem with fresh oysters.",Defiance Vineyard,88,19.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Viognier,Nefarious Cellars
49999,Chile,"Santa Ema seems to be striving for the ripest possible style they can get, and along the way they have found that while also losing some elegance. It starts with sweet, jammy aromas that are not far from melted red licorice. The palate is saturated with berry flavors, while the feel is thick but slightly flat. Could use more edge and compexity, but on the plus side it's lush and pleasant.",Amplus,88,19.0,Cachapoal Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Ema
50000,US,"Primarily composed of Syrah, this Rosé is delightfully tart and spicy, wrapping tangy strawberry fruit in light flavors of malted milk chocolate. Plenty of acid keeps it lively and fresh.",,88,10.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Rosé,RiverAerie
50001,Chile,"The Best Buy parade for Chilean Sauvignon Blanc is bolstered by this pure, stable '07. The nose deals hints of melon, vanilla bean and lime, although it's mostly neutral. Flavors of green apple, citrus and so forth are familiar, while the feel and finish are smooth, comfortable and just deep enough. Drink now.",Winemaker's Selection,88,10.0,Rapel Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Yali
50002,Chile,"Rich and sweet smelling right from the start, with mocha, shoe polish and charred aromas. The wine is ripe to the point of being sticky, while the flavors are naturally herbal, with olive, berry and earth notes. Shows good balance, feel and nerve. A new and worthy Carmenère to keep an eye on.",Chamán Gran Reserva,88,20.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Carmenère,Viña Santacruz
50003,Australia,"A medium-bodied, not-too-sweet sparkler with some slightly mature, mushroomy notes to go with scents of buttered saltines and a clean, fresh finish. A pleasant surprise worthy of your next country club gala.",Australian Sparkling,88,15.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Champagne Blend,Greg Norman Estates
50004,France,"This is initially rich, but it does have a distinct level of acidity that gives the wine fruit flavors that are more towards currants than stone fruit. The structure is all there, and the wine finishes with tight acidity.",,88,,Burgundy,Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Anne Gros
50005,US,"This is a good baseline Merlot, blended with small amounts of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. Once again the wine opens with a very pretty nose, scented with pipe tobacco and cherry. Those flavors move into a satisfying middle, with nothing vegetal or even too herbal, but the black cherry fruit is joined by dried leaves and black olive complexities.",,88,17.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Barnard Griffin
50006,France,"A firm wine that has ripe but structured tannins. It is not a big wine, but rather shows a tighter style of Pinot Noir that balances sweet red fruits and a spice edge of wood. It would benefit from aging for 2–3 years.",Domaine du Clos Frantin,88,,Burgundy,Vosne-Romanée,,Pinot Noir,Albert Bichot
50007,US,"Flirts with being too oaky, but steps back at the last moment, allowing the toasty vanilla and caramel to accent, not overwhelm, the exotic tropical fruit and spice flavors. Comes across as flamboyant, but balanced. A wine to watch.",,88,25.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Viognier,Black Ridge
50008,US,"Made in a drier, more tannic style compared to some top Napa Cabs, this Bordeaux blend is elegant rather than opulent. It has red currant, licorice and new oak flavors framed by hard, astringent tannins. Could develop with bottle age after 2011.",,88,75.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,J. Davies
50009,US,"Very rich in wild cherry, raspberry, red currant, tangerine zest, cola and smoky oak flavors, this Pinot also has a closed, quality due to vibrant acidity and some very finely ground tannins. Decant if you drink now. Could come into its own after 2010, but it's an unproved wine from the Boisset America team.",No. 11,88,75.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,JCB

Imported by Laird & Company.",,87,30.0,Veneto,Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Santa Sofia
50019,Spain,"A little old school with its dill and vanilla aromas and flavors, but with leather, raisin and berry accents and a nice medium-deep body, it more than gets the job done. The palate features herbal plum and berry flavors, while the finish is a bit short on fruit and long on dill. Improves with airing; drink now. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Reserva,87,24.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Valdubón
50020,Italy,"Floral notes of dried rose petal and cinnamon potpourri open the nose of this wine. They are followed by fruit tones of cherry, apple, blackberry and prune.

Drink right away. Imported by Republic National Distributing Co..",Torre la Moreira,87,18.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Marqués de Vizhoja
50024,US,"This is a very Zinny Zinfandel.  Spice is the star. Pepper, nutmeg, cardamon, cumin, star anise, you get the idea. Otherwise, you'll find wild mountain cherries and a tang of Dr. Pepper cola.

50025,Spain,"The Crespiello grape isn't one you see often, but it yields a deep, dark style of wine with balsamic notes, fresh black-fruit flavors and weight. This one is almost on the side of cooked, but not quite, thus it blazes a path with blackberry, smoked meat, jerky spice and more. A touch flat but not flabby.",Crespiello,87,52.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Crespiello,Pulchrum

50035,Italy,"This is an opulent ripasso with dense oak shavings and aromas of chocolate fudge, vanilla infusion, crème caramel and Indian spice.

50095,Italy,Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot are aged in large oak casks to produce a balanced relationship between the wine's fruit and spice-driven components.

50098,US,"Accented with intriguing notes of charred oak, dried herbs, porcini mushrooms and a whisper of peppery grains of paradise, this is a rustic Merlot.

50101,Italy,"Liquid smoke and toasted elements of roasted hazelnut and cured meat dominate the nose of this modern Barbera d'Alba.

50106,Australia,"Pinot Gris is trendy in Australia, which to date hasn't meant great things in terms of home-grown quality.

50109,South Africa,"With a confectioned finish and sweet mocha notes on the nose, this might have seen a little too much wood in its 16 months in new French oak.

50117,US,"Good raspberry, cherry, orange tea, Dr. Pepper and Asian spice flavors in this wine, brightened with crisp acidity and wrapped into a silky texture. Seems a bit simple and direct though.

50119,Australia,"Bright, crisp and fresh, as a 2009 Clare Riesling should be, this is a pretty wine, blooming on the nose with floral notes, apples and citrus fruit.

50121,US,"Quite a nice Cabernet. The grapes got ripe under the mountain sun, contributing blackberry and cherry flavors, while a touch of oak adds caramelized toast.

50129,Italy,"The oak influence here is obvious and does cover some of the natural fruity brightness that is inherent to the Barbera grape.

50131,Spain,"Full, dark and dense, with blackberry, molasses and bacon on the nose. At first it seems modern and new-wave, but the palate isn't fat and overextracted; instead it's zesty, vibrant and deals pugnacious blackberry flavors topped with spice and chocolate. A lively, forward but manageable wine to drink now through 2014. Only 416 cases made.",Phincas,90,38.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,DSG Vineyards
50132,US,"A dry, robust Pinot Noir. Starts out a little rustic, with big tannins and acidity that give the cherries a sour candy taste. But it's complex, with a meaty edge, and elegantly constructed.

50133,US,"Tight, young and somewhat impenetrable, this pure Cabernet from the estate vineyard on Red Mountain is tannic and sharp. The fruit shows cherry and cassis, and the alcohol (listed at 14.9%) is mostly contained. But it's a hard wine, and does not seem to have the complex aromatics that promise more detail with age. Drink it now, for its pure, young fruit and match it to a thick, juicy steak.",Grand Ciel,90,140.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,DeLille
50134,US,"Lots of acidity in this fresh young Pinot. Oak, too, which gives dominating aromas and flavors of toast and caramel.

50135,Italy,This well integrated Aglianico del Vulture opens with ripe notes of black fruit and dried currants backed by softer aromas of leather and crushed clove or cinnamon.

50136,Spain,"Quite impressive and eyebrow raising for Graciano. The nose is smoky and dry, with raspberry and bacon. In the mouth, acidity is controlled and thus there's no sourness to the plum, tomato, spice and vanilla flavors. Finishes with verve and elegance; a nice potential partner for just about any food. Drink now through 2015.",,90,18.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Graciano,Bodegas Ondarre
50137,Spain,"Heavy, oily and well oaked, but also elegant, elevated and something out of the ordinary. This is barrel-fermented Viura at a high quality level; it's smooth, creamy and lifted but also acid-rich and lemony, with notes of toast, vanilla, melon and wood resin. A potentially fine wine to drink now with baked or sautéed fish.",Cosme Palacio 1894 Blanco,90,50.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,White Blend,Bodegas Palacio

50140,US,"Pure varietal, with alcohol around 13.5%—typical for Robert Karl reds. Smooth entry, rich fruit and excellent structure.

The tannins just barely hint at an herbal underpinning, but are plenty ripe.",,90,22.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Merlot,Robert Karl
50141,US,"Pure varietal, with a bouquet of violets, berries, a bit of green herb and a whiff of green coffee. Nicely balanced, with great aromatic complexity.

50142,Spain,"Unlike TG's Abadía de San Campio Albariño, this wine also features Loureira and Caiño Blanco, and it's more interesting in the long run. Aromas of mango and pineapple are sweet and pungent, while the palate is round, leesy and plump, with green melon, apple, vanilla and creamy notes. Fleshy on the finish, but with good acidity. Will accompany shellfish of all sorts.",O Rosal,90,24.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,White Blend,Terras Gauda
50143,US,"An unusual, dry-farmed vineyard, yielding tight, tough, chewy fruit and a compelling clay and earth foundation. Excellent structure, though not open or inviting at this time.

50144,Chile,"Toasty and solid on the nose, with hints of mineral, dark spice, black olive and cassis.

50146,US,"The first Boushey vineyard Roussanne from McCrea includes a 25% portion of Grenache Blanc. The wine is sharp and high-toned, with a bit of burn to the finish.

50147,US,"Heavy, tannic and dense now, but clearly well-grown, this Bordeaux blend wants a little time in the cellar to knit together. An unusual blend of Malbec and Petit Verdot, it's rich and captivating in black currants and cassis, with a long, spicy finish. Shows masterful blending talent, combining grapes from the Alexander and Dry Creek valleys. Hold until after 2012.",Le Petit Malin,90,28.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,William Knuttel

50151,Chile,"A slight amount of eucalyptus on the nose gives this wine an herbal element to go with cassis and blackberry.

50153,Spain,"Bulky, dark, saturated and leathery on the nose, and then a little salty and edgy in the mouth, with a streak of zingy acidity along with roasted, tangy, thick blackberry flavors.

50157,Spain,"Opens with alluring, classic aromas of spice, cinnamon, leather, vanilla and tomato along with raspberry.

50163,Germany,"From a famously mineral vineyard site, this wine does show a certain dusty, talcum-powder note of astringency on the finish.

50361,Argentina,"By Nicasia's high previous standards, this wine from a substandard vintage is lacking. After an opening of sweet berry aromas, cured meat and spice, it's very sweet and candied tasting, with milk chocolate and carob flavors along with unabsorbed oak. Has an easy flow and soft tannins but doesn't have the precision, depth, crispness and totality of the 2005, '06 or '07.",Nicasia Vineyard,89,100.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata

50364,US,"This is the winery's junior version of their very fine Purple Label Cabernet. It's a very good wine, if a little eccentric for a Cabernet Sauvignon.

50366,Argentina,"A touch reedy and rooty on the nose, but it settles to offer plum and berry aromas and complexity.

50451,Spain,"Can't call it floral and bright on the nose, but it's not over the hill or maderized, either; more neutral than anything.

50473,Australia,"Made in a rather lean, racy style, the big question for this wine is whether it will soften and flesh out over the next five years or so.

50590,US,"This unusual blend has been a hit for Brander since its inception. The '07 is a rich wine, with high acidity and exotic tropical fruit, cherry, honey, vanilla cookie and spice flavors.

50591,US,"This is the first varietal Grenache from Bunnell Family, with grapes from Boushey and Olsen vineyards. It's rare enough to find Washington Grenache, as the grape was essentially wiped out in the mid-1990s.

50594,Chile,"Slightly shy, with aromas of olive, herbs and mushroom accenting the dark fruit that rules. The palate is thick, like jam, with chewy fruit and smooth tannins.

50595,US,"Somehow, this California winery manages to put out the best budget Syrah in all of Washington State. Pure varietal, this excellent bottle brings clean berry fruit, natural acids and moderate tannins into play, with none of the bizarrely sweet vanilla and tobacco flavors that typically show up on Yellowtail wannabes.

50598,Argentina,"Nice and ripe, with cassis, blackberry and some oaky softness up front. The palate is convincing and properly textured, and it deals tasty cassis and plum-like flavors.

50599,Argentina,"This wine purports to cause whiplash, supposedly because it's so good, hence the “HeadSnapper” name. And while that's not likely to take place, its blackberry, toast and brambly undercurrent give it character, while the finish is cushioned and long, albeit a touch oaky.

50600,France,"The price of this cuvée has risen considerably over the years, but at least the quality has remained high.

50604,Australia,"The U.S. doesn't really need more “cute” Shiraz labels, but at least the wine in this bottle is pretty good. A bit of shoe polish gives the nose a lifted character, which serves to accentuate the wine's woodsmoke and black olive aromas.

50608,US,"A mix of vineyards and AVAs go into this blended Syrah, which is co-fermented with 6% Viognier. The Viognier is definitely present, and the wine has a top end of grapefruit and citrus, adding scent, flavor and acid.

50730,Italy,Duca San Felice Riserva is an historic wine that highlights the potential of winemaking in Calabria (the toe of the boot of Italy) and its native Gaglioppo grape.

50731,US,"A great first effort from the new Jaxon Keys winery's estate Sauvignon Blanc vineyard, with green apple, pear, ripe melon and honey prominent throughout the wine's rich, creamy texture, with just a touch of key lime.

50734,Australia,"This wine's aromas and flavors amount to an inconsistent mix of superripe (chocolate and prune) notes with those that are less so (herbal, tart raspberry) at first, but it does seem to settle down with some time in the glass, becoming more integrated but staying rather crisp on the finish.

50743,US,"An interesting blend, with 10% Petit Verdot. The PV puts a rich and evocative bouquet front and forward—a lush and seductive mix of incense, cinnamon, Asian spice and coffee cream.

50756,US,"Just two barrels of 100% Syrah were made, using fruit from this dry-farmed vineyard with a distinctive flavor stamp. Tart, acidic, a bit spiky, with fruit flavors of sweet cherry tomato and grape candy.

50757,Australia,"This is a fairly full-bodied Cabernet that manages to be intense without being overbearing, balancing cassis and tobacco shadings with a hint of tomato leaf.

50766,Spain,"Intense and frisky, with mild green-herbal aromas standing out on the nose.

51144,US,"A spectacular Pinot, continuing a string of great vintages from this little vineyard. The year 2007 gave California supernaturally rich but balanced Pinot Noirs, and this is one of them. It's sensational, offering broad, exotic fruit flavors, pinpointed with exotic spices, and exquisitely highlighted with French oak.

51146,US,"This is a big Pinot Noir, dark and full bodied and juicy in pomegranates, cherries, red plums and sautéed wild mushrooms, and the interplay of oak with fruit even yields richer notes of milk chocolate.

With its fine tannins and exquisite balance, this articulate young wine should be best after 2013.",The Narrows Vineyard,96,75.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Goldeneye
51147,Germany,"From a vintage not known for its supersweet selections, this wine is a revelation. Honey and bergamot notes mingle easily on the nose, while the palate unfolds to reveal layers of honey, dried apricots and orange marmalade.

51148,France,"With only 795 bottles produced, this is a special treat. Although it's ready to drink now, it has the structure and pedigree to age for decades. Loaded with rich nut and rancio flavors, there's so much going on; aromas of dried orange peel, gingerbread, toasted macadamia nut and a drizzle of molasses lead into flavors of dried red plum and fig dusted with Nutella powder and soft white pepper.

It's enormous and gigantic in volume, with blackberry and cherry pie filling, cassis and oak flavors that scream, yet the tannins are tight, and the wine is so dry, the rich fruit is cloaked in a veil of control.

51179,US,"The winery rarely produces single-vineyard bubblies, so when they do, it's because their team believes in the bottling. And when you taste this 100% Chardonnay, you understand why. It's dry and rich in acidity, with yeasty lees and toast that frame gorgeous tangerine, Meyer lemon, lime and vanilla bean flavors. The mousse is ultrarefined, making it great for drinking now. This sparking wine could age until at least 2024, gradually losing effervescence and primary fruit but gaining in subtlety.",Tognetti Vineyard Brut,96,70.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg
51180,Chile,"Smells a little feline at first, but it settles with air while still remaining spunky, herbal and typical of Los Lingues Carmenère.

51455,US,"The best Cara Mia yet, this is Red Mountain Cabernet Franc from the estate vineyard, with 15% Merlot and 8% Petit Verdot included. Stylish and compact, this seems sculpted with pure, vivid purple fruits, balanced against crisp, fine-grained tannins. The depth and concentration are noteworthy.",Cara Mia Vineyard Bel Canto,95,60.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Cadence
51456,Spain,"Smoky berry, lemon peel, graphite and huge black-fruit aromas provide a stellar opening. Raw tannins and staunchness create a powerful palate that needs time to mellow out. Flavors of loud oak, black fruits, hard spices, toast and licorice finish peppery, tough and with some heat. Best from 2015–2023.",Alabaster,95,220.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
51457,US,"Made from various St. Helena vineyards, with some additions from eastern Oakville, it expresses all the beauty of Napa Valley Cab. The flavors of blackberries, black currants, chocolate, licorice and smoky cedar are absolutely delicious. Yet the wine possesses structure, not the easiest thing to achieve with a 100% Cabernet this rich. The wine should age well through 2020, but there's no reason not to drink it now.",Generations,95,130.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Raymond
51458,Italy,"This stunning, full-bodied wine is in the running as one of the best white wines in Italy. It's perfumed with acacia flower, Spanish broom, beeswax, flint and tree fruit. The delicious palate delivers green apple, Anjou pear and mineral sensations of mesmerizing depth. It will develop even more complexity over time. Drink through 2025.",Pietramarina Bianco Superiore,95,45.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Etna,,Carricante,Benanti
51459,US,"Grown in one of the valley's best vineyards, it's eminently ageable. The flavors of black currants and minerals are intense and fine, complexed with new French oak. However, the strong tannins will jacket the wine for a long time before they begin to fall out. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2024, and it could be awesome in 2030.",M5 Stagecoach Vineyard,95,150.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Krupp Brothers
51460,US,"Force Majeure and Ciel du Cheval are the sources for this pure, compelling Red Mountain Syrah. The complex aromatics shoot up a smorgasbord of cured meat, truffle and umami notes, leading into a crisp, racy palate with lovely blueberry-dominated fruit flavors. Aging in 500-liter puncheons smoothes it out while contributing just a hint of new toast.",Wild Eyed,95,48.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Mark Ryan
51461,US,"Spectacular is the word that comes to mind here. Tasted over many hours, this stunning effort proved itself over and over. A mix of citrus oils, tree fruits, a hint of honey, tea, lemon verbena and more, it delivers astonishing complexity and flavor for such a young wine. It should continue to evolve and improve from 2024–2034.",Bacchus Vineyard,95,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Riesling,Januik
51462,US,"Based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this shows hard tannins and dryness despite the intensely ripe blackberries and cherries at its core. Two-thirds new French oak is not too much, adding balancing toast and wood tannins. This gorgeous wine will begin to come into its own by 2018, and should evolve for many more years.",Core Stone,95,125.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Oakville East
51463,US,"Dry, tart and balanced, it has keen acidity highlighting complex flavors of pomegranates, persimmons, cherries and sandalwood, with the earthy, plummy sweetness of mu shu sauce. This wine gets better and better as it breathes in the glass. It's hard to keep from opening it now, but it will benefit from aging; best after 2018.",Olivet Lane Vineyard,95,75.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
51464,US,"Intriguing scents focus upon chamomile and Mediterranean herbs, while the fruit flavors are wild and brambly. Cherry candy and red licorice play broadly across the palate, lingering through a beautifully balanced and extended finish.",Père de Famille,95,68.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Betz Family
51465,US,"There's good structure to this Cabernet, thanks to the firm tannins and ample acidity. But the flavors take the starring role, with raspberries, cherries, currants, mocha and cedar. It has a light, delicate mouthfeel, although there's nothing light about the taste. It's complex and ageable, so give it until 2020 to begin to come around.",Private Reserve,95,126.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Coomber Family Ranch
51466,US,"Simply sensational, this estate-grown Viognier raises the bar for everyone.

Outstanding concentration, focus and depth, with juicy acidity underlying an astonishing finish.",,95,30.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Viognier,Abeja
51467,US,"This delightfully pure expression of the Syrah grape seduces from the first sniff, which sails along on a flying carpet of blue and purple fruits, licorice, clove and tobacco. The beguiling aromas continue in the mouth, where the wine assumes a seamless, plump and powerful presence. Ciel du Cheval Syrah is every bit as good as the Bordeaux grapes for which the vineyard is most famous.",Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,94,35.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Januik
51468,US,"Leonetti's Merlot is the only wine among their four annual releases to debut a year early. It's a good thing with this wine, which is smooth and packed with rich black-cherry and cassis fruit flavors. Also in the blend are small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. The tannins are slightly granular, and soaked with cocoa flavor, giving it a pleasingly dark, toasty edge.",,94,75.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Leonetti Cellar
51469,US,"Tight, tannic and undrinkable now because it's so young, this 100% Cabernet needs a great deal of time to come around. Right now, it's hard as nails, a wine whose astringency stings the gums despite impressively intensely ripe blackberry jam and black currant flavors. It should be great in 2020–2025.",State Lane Vineyard,94,72.0,California,Yountville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Corley
51470,US,"Dense with flavors of blueberry and cassis, it's been soaked in delicious French oak barrels (60% new) for 30 months, and then given further bottle age before being released. Coconut and vanilla highlights are threaded through long, fine, dense, ripe tannins. This strong, stylish wine can be cellared until 2024–2029.",Estate Grown,94,40.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tranche
51471,US,"Williams  Selyem's track record with this bottling is excellent. While this 2012 has notes of raisins, they're more of a seasoning than the main ingredient. It's a robust, lusty wine, filled with blackberries, dark chocolate, anise and pepper, yet balanced. It will age through 2024.",Papera Vineyard,94,55.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
51472,US,"Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated, this also includes smaller amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Polished and dense, it offers pure, concentrated cassis fruit, framed by dark flavors of coffee and licorice. Give this one plenty of breathing time, as it's a high-octane powerhouse that needs some unpacking. Cellar until 2017, and possibly beyond.",Dead Horse,94,52.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mark Ryan
51473,US,"Ripe, opulent black currants and violets, melted into liquid and bathed in toasty oak, are the flavors of this 100% Cabernet. Alcohol brings subtle heat and sweet glycerine, but the finish is dry and long. It's a beautiful evocation of St. Helena terroir, but needs aging. Give it a try in 2018, and it should have no trouble gliding well into the 2020s.",Yewell Vineyard,94,72.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Corley
51474,US,"This is the estate bottling, barrel-fermented in French oak and put through full malolactic. Spice and toast frame perfectly ripened tree fruit flavors of apple, pear and orange peel. The concentration and length suggest that this Chardonnay can be cellared for up to a decade.",,94,40.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Abeja
51475,Argentina,"As far as Argentine Syrah goes, this vintage of Iscay, which contains 3% Viognier in a nod to France, is the new benchmark for the country. Daniel Pi and Joey Tensley's wine discloses aromas of jammy berry fruits along with cardamom and floral notes. The palate is a fortress of layers, while flavors of blackberry, cassis and chocolate set the stage for finishing notes of vanilla, butter, espresso and cocoa powder. Drink through 2018.",Iscay,94,75.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah-Viognier,Trapiche
51476,US,"Blended with a drop of Merlot, this Cabernet Sauvignon remains deeply tannic and dry. It has classic flavors of black currants, anise liqueur and minerals, with quite a bit of acidity. It's complex, compelling and still far too young. Give it until 2018 to begin to come around, and it will be gorgeous in the mid-2020s.",,94,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Corley Reserve
51477,US,"The wine is always a blend of the winery's best vineyards in the northern, warm section of the valley, including Allen, Rochioli Riverblock and Williams Selyem's Estate.

51478,US,"Though not at all unsung (in fact, mailing list is closed), Abeja wines offer exceptional quality for the price across the entire lineup. Case in point: this super-long, ultradelicious Chardonnay, a generous wine with green apple, lime and white peach; add in notes of butter, brioche and baking spices. The length and balance, along with the pure pleasure, far exceed the price.",,94,36.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Chardonnay,Abeja
51479,Italy,"This gorgeous wine from southern Italy shows the true potential of native grape Aglianico. It opens with an intense fragrance of black cherry, leather, truffle, underbrush and spice.

Drink through 2027.",Radici,94,60.0,Southern Italy,Taurasi,,Aglianico,Mastroberardino
51480,US,"Feels a bit tannic and heavy in its youth, with dark chocolate, tobacco and herb-infused blackberry and currant flavors that are swimming in hardness. But it's very dry and balanced, and should easily glide through the next 6 to 8 years, gradually turning sweeter as it throws sediment and ages.",Belloni,87,35.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Ravenswood
51481,US,"Made from 90% Pinot Noir with the balance Chardonnay, this beautifully colored bubbly shows the integrity the house of Schramsberg brings to its sparkling wines.

51482,US,"This is the first-ever Walla Walla wine from Ron Bunnell's RiverAerie label, and the excellent fruit is mostly from Spofford Station. It's 77% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Syrah.

Simple and satisfying.",,87,21.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,RiverAerie
51483,Chile,"A little sharpness on the nose tilts things toward red fruit and rhubarb, yet the palate is more deep and dark, albeit slightly tough.

A brawny specimen with natural vigor and ample oak.",Queulat Gran Reserva,87,18.0,Maipo Valley,,,Merlot,Ventisquero
51484,US,"This bottling can be variable, but the '05 vintage helped craft a balanced, likeable Cab that shows true Napa quality at an everyday price.

51487,US,"Made in the style of an old field blend, this Zin is at least 75% varietal, but the balance could be anything among 14 other grapes.

51488,Argentina,"Quite toasty and black, with baked plum, berry and crusty, oaky aromas. The palate is sort of soft and lazy, but amid the thickness there's roasted plum and black cherry flavors.

51489,US,"About three quarters Sauvignon Blanc, lightly grassy and touched with sweet herb, this wine ramps up the flavors with the addition of the Sémillon, which brings more stone fruits into the midpalate.

51494,US,"Quite a good wine, but the powerful oak is a bit intrusive at this time. It swamps the mouth with caramel and crème brûlée. Below all that seems to be a fine, pineapple-flavored Chardonnay.

51499,US,"A lovely, crisp wine that shows many of the excellent characteristics of Laetitia's more expensive vineyard block bottlings, without the complexity.

51500,US,"The blend is 85% Viognier and 15% Roussanne, and finishes off-dry with 1.5% residual sugar.

51501,Argentina,"A mature, restrained wine with earth, leather, red pepper flake and dry fruit on the nose. The palate is roasted and a touch acidic, but because of that you'll never perceive it as fat and lazy. Finishes with some baked brown sugar, leather and tannic grab. A good food wine.

51509,Chile,"Chilean wine folk have been saying that we should watch Limarí for cool-climate Chardonnay. This example is clean and medium-weight, with aromas of apple and pear.

The immediate impact of the fruit is amplified by the density on the palate, and the finish, loaded with baking spices, reflects the aging in one-third new French oak barrels.",Zenith Vineyard,93,90.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Adelsheim
51724,Italy,"One of the best wines made on the beautiful island of Sicily, Donnafugata's Mille e Una Notte exhibits gorgeous smoothness in the mouth and exceedingly rich aromas of black currants, chocolate, spice and tobacco.

51727,US,"A few years in the bottle are beginning to age this charming Chardonnay, although its brisk acidity and minerality remain.

51728,France,"With its firm, black fruits, this is a very chunky wine, mineral in character. It has tension, with tannins layered with intense flavors, very structured. It needs aging.

51731,US,"A beautiful Cabernet, dry, smoothly tannic and impressive for its volume of flavor. Shows a complex range of blackberries, black currants, minerals and oak, with a long, spicy finish.

51732,US,"A lovely Pinot Noir, dry and silky and rich, with complex flavors of raspberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, sandalwood and white pepper. Easy to drink now for its sleekness and elegance.

51733,Germany,"Schloss Saarstein's auslese is remarkably consistent year to year, testament to the greatness of the site and the quality of the farming and winemaking. The 2008 features cool, slate-driven scents softened just slightly by hints of superripe apples and ripe apricot.

It's a fantastically delicious wine, completely satisfying in raspberry, cherry, persimmon, toast, spice and vanilla flavors, and balanced with bright, coastal acidity.

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Foley

51738,Argentina,"One sniff tells you plenty: there's attractive spice, coffee and leather to go with rich molasses and broad black-fruit aromas. The palate maintains balance due to fine, fresh acidity, and the flavor profile brings mocha, coffee, berry, plum and toast. Delicious, deep, layered and refined.

51739,France,"With just shy of 1,000 bottles produced, this will be hard to find. Dried fruit flavors of raspberry and red plum dominate the nose and mouth, while notes of sweet mulled spice, clove-pricked orange rind, pepper, walnut skin and bittersweet cocoa glimmer throughout.

51742,Germany,"This succulent, almost tender, wine starts off with lovely aromas of honey and bergamot, adding hints of apricot and vanilla in the mouth.

51746,US,"This small, family-owned, biodynamically farmed vineyard and winery is quickly becoming a southern Oregon cult producer. Certainly one of the finest Viogniers produced anywhere in the Northwest, this extraordinarily aromatic wine showers the palate with luscious and tangy lemon, pineapple, Satsuma orange and pear fruit flavors.

51756,US,"As in 2009, the 2010 Bully includes 10% Petit Verdot, and was aged in 100% new French oak.

51763,US,"This is a first for Forgeron, blending Boushey Syrah with Grenache and Mourvèdre.

It may be 18 years old, but it looks likely to age for several years yet.",Grand Vintage Collection Brut,96,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Moët & Chandon
51896,Italy,"Costa Grimaldi is a spectacular wine that surprises with every sip thanks to its intensity and the extraordinary quality of its mouthfeel. Initially, the wine is soft and yielding with tones of red cherry, chocolate, cola, licorice and mineral. It grows even more opulent and velvety in the mouth thanks to its fine texture and tannins. Keep this wine in your cellar ten years plus.",Costa Grimaldi,96,70.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Poderi Luigi Einaudi
51897,France,"Intensely Chardonnay, this beautiful wine, named after the ancient rulers of Champagne, is pure mineral, green and citrus fruits, a steely shaft of pure concentration. Now just with a light touch of toast, this still will mature for several years.",Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs,96,180.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Taittinger
51898,US,"A big wine, rather ponderous now in the size and forwardness of its fruit and the volume of mainly new French oak. The fruit is massive, suggesting black and red sour cherry candy, with oak influences of smoky char and pencil shavings, and complex notes of minerals and sweet violet flowers. But it all needs time to come together. Tasted in a large flight of 2007 Rutherford Cabernets and Bordeaux blends, this was easily the star. Really hard to exaggerate the wine's beauty and elegance. Best 2013–2019, at least.",,96,175.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Staglin
51899,US,"An extraordinary Cabernet that stands out even in this great vintage, and among its Rutherford peers. Quite dry and tannic in youth, it shows an astringency that strongly suggests the cellar. Underneath are powerhouse flavors of blackberries, black and red cherries, spices, tea and cedar. Really defines balance and elegance in a Napa Cabernet. Decant if you drink it now, but it should develop for years to come.",,96,42.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Long Meadow Ranch

51911,France,"Smooth and modern in character, with toast and sweet-tasting fruit notes, this is a wine that characterizes the New World school of Bordeaux winemaking.

51915,Chile,"A dark berry aroma comes with a distinct whiff of green.

It tastes briary and like tomato sauce on the finish.",Limited Edition,86,25.0,Curicó Valley,,,Carmenère,Echeverria
51916,US,"This unusual blend of multiple red varieties sure has plenty of personality, with strong white-pepper, raisin and blackberry jam flavors, plus robust tannins and a very dry finish.

51922,Chile,"The cool conditions that defined the 2011 vintage in Chile are draped all over this Chardonnay. The nose deals notes of applesauce and oaky cinnamon, while the palate is sleepy, with very little happening.

51934,US,"A good Zin, if a little rugged in tannins, with briary, wild blackberry, currant, chocolate and spice flavors that finish dry and tannic.

51937,Chile,"A little earthy and leafy on the nose and palate, but we like the wine's balance and saturation as well as its flavors of herbal cherry and berry. Finishes more roasted and warm, with kick carrying it toward conclusion. Grabby and leafy but good for $9.",Reserva,85,9.0,Maipo Valley,,,Shiraz,Santa Alicia
51938,Chile,"Forceful on the nose, with herbal, saucy, rubbery aromas. It's weighty in the mouth, with blackberry, herbal tomato and dry spice flavors. Feels pretty good on the finish, which comes with a lasting herbal accent. A little grating but solid enough.",Reserva,85,11.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Merlot,Veramonte
51939,Italy,"The oak element is strong here—very strong—and one wonders if it will ever fully integrate even with more years of aging in the bottle. There's not much fruit left and what you do get is ripe and jammy. You can feel the alcohol at the back. Otherwise, the wine is dense and smooth on the palate.",Conca del Grillo,85,19.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Silvano Bolmida
51940,Chile,"Starts out kind of murky and pasty, with gummy black fruit and compost aromas. Airing helps it escape that shell, and in the mouth there's rubbery blueberry flavors mixed with mildly tart rhubarb and bramble. Good enough, but doesn't do much to push the envelope that is Chilean Syrah.",Winemaker's Collection,85,15.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Syrah,Simone
51941,US,"There's a whiff of volatile, hot fermentation aromas that overlie black cherry and smoky tar.

51944,US,"Given its late release, this has been in bottle for quite awhile, and is soft and already heading into midlife.

51946,US,"Hendry has waited nearly four years to release this Zin, but it's not clear that age is on its side.

51947,Australia,"This is mainly Semillon and Sauvignon Blanc, with 25% Chardonnay and 9% Pinot Gris to round out the midpalate.

51952,New Zealand,"Hunter's is an old New Zealand wine brand that should do better. That said, this is a solid Savvie, combining tropical fruit with fresh herbaceousness. A suggestion of sweetness on the midpalate is balanced by tart acids on the finish.",Jane Hunter,85,13.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Hunter's
51953,Chile,"Quite raisiny, with an overweight personality conveyed through the nose. The palate is tannic, with black cherry and cola flavors thickened up by a full dose of raisin.

51957,Australia,"Renowned for its restraint and fine-ness, Mount Mary is an icon of Australian wine, and one that seems to perplex many American critics, including this one.

51962,Spain,"The first 2007 reds from Spain are now appearing, and it seems like talk of a tough vintage are being confirmed. This wine is sheer and miserly.

The palate is fairly round, with lemon-lime and pineapple flavors. Citric if a bit pithy on the finish. Fine but average.",,85,10.0,Maule Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Lucky7
52249,New Zealand,"Costco's private-label Sauvignon Blanc is priced right and offers a fruity mouthful of melon and gooseberry flavor. The citrusy finish is a bit short, but pleasant.",,85,7.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Riparian

52252,New Zealand,"A bit too pungent and sweaty to score higher, with pronounced and aggressive nettley aromas and flavors. It's round in the mouth, finishing herbal and green. Some will no doubt praise it for these same qualities.",Reserve,85,17.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Brancott
52253,Italy,"Here's a luminous and crystalline white wine in a screwcap bottle with linear and direct aromas of white mineral, kiwi and pear.

52255,France,"Somewhat hard edged, this is as dry as possible, hinting at toast as well as lentils and quince. The acidity is balanced, but the wine shies away from the pleasure factor.",Cuvée S,85,18.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,,Rosé,Domaine de Souviou
52256,Chile,"Plump, sweet and tropical on the nose, but also not that focused or powerful. The palate is flat in feel and a bit sticky, with vague, candied flavors of papaya and melon. There's even an Animal Cracker quality to the finish. Good but not great.",Novas Limited Selection,85,17.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Emiliana
52257,South Africa,"Some feline essence aromas appear on the nose with supporting notes of tart gooseberry and wet, dewey grass.

52258,US,"A good and flavorful Cab, with intricate layers of blackberries, currants, anise and cedar, and entirely dry. The drawback is sharpness in the form of green, acidic tannins. Won't age, so drink up.",,85,23.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,B Side

52260,US,"This year's Matriarch is very similar to Harlan Estate in structure, and in some ways, a superior wine, or at least more delicious now. Shows the most beautiful black currant, cedar, blueberry pie and Asian spice flavors. What makes the structure so gorgeous are the firm tannins. Ultimately, it's a refined, exquisite red wine. Hard to imagine a better one for drinking over the next decade, and just shows that price sometimes has no relationship to quality.",The Matriarch,98,90.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,BOND
52261,US,"Price be damned, this is an authentically gorgeous, important Cabernet Sauvignon. It calls to mind the amazing 2001, with its huge, perfect tannins and acids and artistic appliqué of new oak. But the star of the show surely is the fruit. Mounds of ripe blackberries and cherries pile up, veering into currants and cassis and something wild and decadently animal, like charred meat. Fabulous now despite the firm tannins, and should evolve for many years.",Backus,97,225.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Joseph Phelps
52262,France,"The balance of this wine is what makes it so impressive. Spice and yellow fruit intermingle effortlessly. There is a core of tight, coiled steel, like a spring, which gives minerality along with the richness.

52265,US,"Massive, decadent. Opens with extraordinary aromas of cedar, black currants, cherries, chocolate, sage, pepper and anise, with hints of roasted game. Feels very round, smooth but powerful.

52267,US,"This is Woodward Canyon's reserve—the best lots of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot create this very limited wine. It is built to age, and reflects the tight and muscular style that Rick Small has developed over the years. There is a strong mineral-metal vein running through the black and blue fruits, and some very lively spicy highlights. Tannins are ripe but firm, and this is a wine that will benefit from further cellaring.",Estate Red Wine,95,59.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Woodward Canyon
52268,US,"Smells a bit minty and peppery, but once in the mouth, turns ultra-generous in black currant, chocolate-covered mint and spicy cedar flavors.

Very fine quality, and likely to hold for many years.",,95,450.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Harlan Estate
52269,US,"Although this Cab is quite tannic, it's really good now. Shows impeccable balance in a New World style that oozes black and red currants, dark chocolate, licorice, cedar and plums, with a note of raw, bloody meat. Very high quality, an excellent rendition of western Paso Robles hillside Cabernet. Good through 2015, with proper cellaring.",Reserve,95,45.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet,Justin
52270,France,"What makes a great Chablis grand cru? It's the intensity of flavor, which can be found in this wine.

52273,US,"Black in color, glyceriney. Massive, deep, tremendous. Some will find it overpowering in New World extraction, but it's a real beauty in that style.

An elegant nose of honey, apricot, butterscotch and spice is followed by a luxuriant, mouth-coating wave of satiny honey and apricot flavors, balanced by citrusy acidity.

52275,France,"This is a bright star in Olivier Leflaive's firmament, a wondrous big, rich wine that is just so finely poised. The structure is dense, rich, fat and full-bodied, a hymn to ripe fruit.

52278,US,"This is not a wine for tonight, or next year, or for at least the next six years. It's shut down in tannins, with an astringency that can't be overcome even with decanting, although that won't stop people from opening it before its time. Buried beneath the tannins are well-developed black currant, roasted meat and cedar flavors that define upscale Napa Cab. Really fine and distinguished, a wine to cellar and enjoy for many years.",Insignia,95,200.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,Joseph Phelps
52279,US,"They call it east, because the grapes are from the Vaca Mountains, and the vineyard faces west. It's a splendid wine, classically proportioned, with rich, thick tannins that have true Napa refinement. The flavors are also classic, suggesting cassis and cedar, with a distinct smack of indescribable minerals. There's a lot of smoky new oak, but it's proportionate to the wine's power.

Impressive, and with a great finishing freshness.",Les Preuses Grand Cru,94,80.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,William Fèvre
52285,US,"There is a little Cabernet Sauvignon (15%) and Syrah (4%) in the blend also. This is a silky, yet muscular— let's say it, masculine—style of Merlot. Meaning that the fruit is concentrated with deep blue and black berry and cassis flavors, augmented with lead pencil. Beautiful polish and concentration characterize this wine, yet it's quite approachable.",,94,39.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Woodward Canyon
52286,France,"This monopole within the Chablis grand cru vineyards produces top Chablis. In 2006, the wine is powerful, but layered with intense minerality, a flinty character on top of the ripe white and yellow fruits. It has concentration, a depth of flavor that is impressive. It will age well.",Domaine Long-Depaquit Moutonne Grand Cru,94,90.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Albert Bichot
52287,France,"A beautiful, ripe wine that shows the richness of 2006 in Chablis. The wine revels in its yellow fruit flavors, apricots, peaches even pineapple, underscored by new wood flavors.

This wine from vines planted in 1932 is linear and intense to the core. It's an ageworthy specimen with fine acidity and a tight structure. Now, it's juicy and a little sharp, with piercing black cherry fruit and spice galore.

It's detailed in the manner of a Pauillac, thick cassis fruit with deep veins of iron, cedar, licorice and a just a hint of silage. The fruit is dark and dense, but with breathing you'll find it begins to open into a splendid blend of black cherry, cassis and mountain berry flavor.

52295,Spain,"Hailing from a 3-acre old-vines vineyard, this fully oaked Rioja blend is toasty to the max but hits with intensity, acidity and depth on the palate.

52296,Spain,"Smoky, rubbery and suggestive of bacon and toast on the nose. The palate is more crisp and snappy, with juicy flavors of red currant, cherry and spice.

52302,US,"Complex and well-crafted, especially at this price point. Two thirds was barrel fermented, one third in tank; there is also about one quarter new oak and one quarter put through malolactic.

It is a 50/50 blend of the 2008 and 2009 vintage—a crafty winemaker decision that has worked beautifully. The wine strikes a perfect balance, neither too young and sharp, nor too soft and fruity. Light touches of cedar and smoke wrap around fruit flavors of strawberry and cherry pie.

Should develop bottle nuance over the next 4–5 years.",Mahoney Ranch,92,32.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Mahoney
52326,US,"A dry, classy Merlot that will develop bottle complexity for a few years. There are beautiful tannins on this well-made wine; if you drink it now, decant to let it breathe, soften and allow the cherry, red currant, dried herb and oak flavors to emerge.",,92,48.0,California,Oak Knoll District,Napa,Merlot,Merryvale
52327,France,"This is a big, black  wine, intensely medicinal and herbal in character. It has powerful, extracted, dark tannins, emphasized by chocolate and spice flavors, as well as dark plums.",Un Jour....,92,,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Le Clos d'un Jour
52328,Italy,"Aromas of peach, honeysuckle and almond are irresistible but the wine really excels in the mouth where it imparts opulent density and richness. This wine is an absolute pleasure to drink. A beautiful Sicilian wine that would pair with shellfish, crab cakes or white meat.",Cometa,92,40.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Fiano,Planeta
52329,US,"With delicious texture and concentration, this Lake County blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre from the 3,000-foot-high Fore Family Vineyard is intensely good, a deep reddish-purple blueberry-tinged infusion of earth and clove spice with dry, tight tannins and even a little lavender that'll linger. This one'll age, but is so convincingly reminiscent of the Northern Rhône right now, it'll be hard to wait.",Red Wine,92,28.0,California,Red Hills Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,G-S-M,Peter Franus
52330,US,"Made in a jammy, soft but enormously rich style, this Syrah is almost like Port, except that it's dry. You'll want to sip it slowly, over time, to let it shape-shift in the glass. It offers waves of cherry pie filling, blackberry marmalade and cassis flavors, touched with sweetly smoked oak. Calls for very rich and elaborate beef and lamb dishes.",Rim Rock,92,46.0,California,California,California Other,Syrah,Piedrasassi
52331,US,"The 2008 vintage was cool and resulted in lighter-bodied wines that also were lower in alcohol. That trend benefited wines like this lovely one from Regale. It has a transparent, silky texture, yet is very rich in cherry pie filling, bacon and Indian spices. Feels beautiful and complex now, and should develop bottle nuance over the next six years.",O'Neel Vineyard,92,48.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Regale Winery and Vineyards
52332,Argentina,"Full, dense and dark, with powerful berry aromas and hints of rubber and leather on the bouquet. The palate breathes complexity and style but also raw power, and the flavors of blackberry, fig paste and herbs are just lusty and rich enough to register as modern Mendoza. Classy and deep; best from 2011–2015. A Malbec-Cabernet-Petit Verdot blend.",,92,70.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Cheval des Andes
52333,Germany,"This auslese is less obviously fruity than many of Loosen's recent efforts, with a smoky, fuel-oil overlay to the honeyed and stone-like flavors. At only 7.5% alcohol, it's sweet yet not heavy, balanced by bright acidity and a hint of prickly CO2 still in evidence. Drink it over the next 15–20 years.",Erdener Prälat Auslese 375 ml,92,42.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Dr. Loosen
52334,Austria,"Big, serious, powerful wine, as complex as Grüner can be. It's powered by ripe apples and thyme, seasoned with pepper. The acidity sets the scene for a wine that can age.",Tabor Reserve Die Räritat,92,,Kremstal,,,Grüner Veltliner,Forstreiter
52335,US,"Just when this Chard seems simple and sweet, the fruit is overtaken by acidity and minerality, taking the tangerine, lime and mango flavors to the next level and making the wine complex and fascinating. Shows how exceptional winemaking can result in exceptional wine.",,92,19.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Vina Robles
52336,US,"This is a delicious wine. The blackberry and cherry jam, chocolate, anise and pepper flavors have a pie filling richness, complete with the smoky-sweet pastry crust. Yet it's totally dry. Feels fine and distinguished, if a little hot in alcohol. Drink now–2012.",Hope Family Vineyard,92,42.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Syrah,Austin Hope
52337,US,"Tastes young and drily tannic now, with an enormous core of blackberries and black cherries. A complex wine to take note of. If you drink it now, decant. Otherwise, give it 3–4 years to do its thing.",Alisos Vineyard,92,36.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,La Fenêtre
52338,US,"Made in a light-bodied, lower-alcohol style, this Pinot feels silky and gentle in the mouth. It really delivers when it comes to flavor. Displays big, impressive notes of raspberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, red licorice, beef jerky and smoky sandalwood that are complex and satisfying, and that finish entirely dry. Drink now and over the next four years.",La Cruz Vineyard,92,44.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller Estate
52339,US,"This baby Cabernet plays tricks on the palate, showing appealing soft, delicious complexity, then retreating into a cloak of tannins, and then emerging again with sweet fruit and spice. It's bone dry, although the cherries and blackberries show a baked-into-the-pie caramelized sweetness. Give this bottle a good six years in the cellar, and it should continue to evolve for far longer.",Gravelly Meadow,92,175.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Diamond Creek
52340,South Africa,"Although this might be second to the Series C, it's still up there in terms of high quality and class. Red plum, fresh fig and subtle blueberry are augmented by glimmers of licorice and earthy spice. The mouth is full and as forward as the nose, loaded with thick juicy fruit flavors that lead gracefully into the raspberry mash and tobacco infused finish. Drink now–2013.",Series M,92,35.0,Paarl,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Vilafonté
52341,Germany,"A departure from the last couple of vintages, with a unique scent of chestnuts adding interest to the sweet, concentrated notes of honey and orange marmalade. It's an odd, different accent, yet the balance of sweetness and bracing acidity is spot on.",Rosa-Goldlack Beerenauslese 375 ml,92,,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Schloss Johannisberger
52342,US,"This first release from the winery is a fine Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Franc. It shows all the hallmarks of a cooler-climate Napa Valley wine in the dryness, refined tannins and herb-inflected cherries and blackberries. An elegant, balanced wine that should develop over the next 5–7 years.",,92,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Virage
52343,France,"A dense wine, tannic and firmly structured. It's one of those wines that are not for the faint-hearted with its power, concentration and medicinal character. Age for several years.",Réserve de Gaudou,91,40.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Château de Gaudou
52344,Italy,"Tancredi is always a beautiful wine and this year's expression (a 70-30 blend of Nero d'Avola and Cabernet Sauvignon) offers great aromatic intensity with soft tones of cherry, vanilla and exotic spice. It closes with good structure and polished tannins.",Tancredi,91,40.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Contessa Entellina,,Red Blend,Donnafugata
52345,Germany,"Pale gold in color. The attractive nose features ripe yellow stone fruit with strong mineral overtones, while the palate reveals enough crisp, refreshing acidity to balance the sweetness.

52347,US,"The Laurène–Drouhin Family Estate Reserve brings a bit more earthiness to the table than the regular DDO bottling. In the mouth, the fruit—a delicate jumble of raspberry, pomegranate, cranberry and sour cherry—mingles with streaks of caramel, herb and leaf. A wine that will reward both cellaring (at least a decade) and studying.",Laurène,91,65.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Domaine Drouhin Oregon
52348,France,"From a vineyard at one of the highest points in the Cahors vineyard (nearly 1,000 feet), this is a smoothly perfumed, wood-aged wine that shows light elegance, acidity as well as dark currant fruits and a touch of mint.",Château de Haute-Serre,91,,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Georges Vigouroux
52349,US,"From a producer to watch in underrated Lodi, this intense, black cherry, bacon-fat and white peppery Syrah has an almost peat-like, whisky aroma at first, very inviting, which then leads into more bacon and pepper that carries through on the palate, balanced by extremely smooth tannins and an unexpected elegance. A really cool Syrah to try on its own that'll go very nicely with meaty, wintery foods.",Farrah,91,20.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Syrah,Klinker Brick
52350,South Africa,"This is a ripe, sweet and immediately attractive dessert wine, with forward aromas and flavors of dried apricot, golden raisin, papaya, honeycomb and gingered orange.

Drink now–2018.",T Noble Late Harvest,92,55.0,Stellenbosch,,,Chenin Blanc,Ken Forrester
52351,Spain,"This full-bodied, ripe wine  offers blackberry and spiced plum aromas on top of a minerally base. In the mouth, it's big but fresh and free-flowing.

52352,France,"Pale salmon pink, this is a beautiful wine both to look at and to taste. It combines a light touch of red fruits with bright acidity and a rich texture. Fresh and pure fruited, it will age through 2015.",Confidentielle,92,52.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence La Londe,,Rosé,Domaine Saint-André de Figuière
52353,France,"With rich apricot juice, sweet red apples and a dry spiciness, it is complex and has aging potential. A mineral element in the texture emphasizes the dry yet rich nature of the wine.

52354,US,"Gorgeously aromatic with notes of white blossoms and waxy lime and lemon skins, this dry, delicately composed Riesling is a stunner. Tart mango and and tangerine flavors are juicy on the palate, accented with lemon verbena and a lingering waxiness. It finishes remarkably long with a streak of lemon acidity and a zesty astringency. Delicious now for its youth and exuberance, but likely to develop well over through 2021–2024.",HJW Vineyard Dry Estate Bottled and Grown,92,39.0,New York,Seneca Lake,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Hermann J. Wiemer
52355,New Zealand,"A ripe, lush style of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, this features ample nectarine and cassis fruit, tinged with just a bit of green leafiness. Ample weight on the mouth gives way to a long, mouthwatering finish. Winemaker Jules Taylor is on a roll.",,92,17.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Jules Taylor
52356,US,"Though labeled Cabernet, it's a full-on, four-grape Bordeaux-style blend. It sports a classic Cabernet nose, dusty, smoky, with cherry tobacco, forest floor and a whiff of barnyard. The fruit remains tart and showing a fair amount of acidity; the tannins stiff and the mouthfeel tight but sensual. Give this one until 2017 to pull itself together.",,92,90.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Leonetti Cellar
52357,US,"As always, this single-vineyard Syrah is a masterful mix of tart fruit, herb, stem and earth flavors. Pomegranate and red currant, umami and gunflint highlights are all in focus.",Boushey Vineyard Liberté,92,50.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Maison Bleue
52358,Turkey,"A nose of cherry, white peach and jalapeño sets the stage. Next, flavors of cherry, plum, sage and thyme work their way through the mouth with an interesting juxtaposition of fruit and savory notes. Super-soft, almost invisible tannins give way to a smooth finish hallmarked by notes of fresh minerality.",Pendore,92,33.0,Aegean,,,Okuzgozu,Kavaklidere
52359,US,"Intensely tropical on the nose with notes of honey-glazed mango and peach, this silky sweet wine is stunningly complex yet unabashedly tasty.

52360,France,"This full-bodied wine pushes the concept of rosé to its limits. Wood-aged and rich, it conveys a sense of structure, mature fruit and delicious toastiness. It has already been aged an extra year, but would benefit from cellaring even longer, so wait until 2015.",Garrus,92,100.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,,Rosé,Château d'Esclans
52361,US,"Some Chardonnays with this much oak and lees influence lose all sense of terroir, but not this one. Somehow, vintner Bill Cooper has allowed the fruit to express itself, showing up as minerals, papayas and apricots. It's balanced and compelling. The price makes it a bargain.",Gravel Ridge Vineyard,92,29.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Cooper-Garrod
52362,US,"A stunner of a rosé, this wine's pale pink hue does little to indicate its action-packed reality. Nectarine, wet stone, and bubble gum occupy the aroma profile, but the flavors are what set it off. Ruby red grapefruit, strawberry shortcake, and a slight lemon chiffon element hammer home this beauty by Sta. Rita Hills-based superstar producer Kris Curran, formerly of both Sea Smoke and Foley. This is versatile enough to handle both seared scallops and grilled babyback pork ribs.",Rosé,92,18.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Grenache,Curran
52363,Spain,"This blend of Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon is a dense, ripe bruiser with huge blackberry aromas that set up a wide-bodied, raw-feeling palate with tons of extract and monster tannins.

Drink through 2021.",Nus del Terrer,92,50.0,Catalonia,Tarragona,,Red Blend,Vinyes del Terrer
52364,Argentina,"Consistent with prior vintages, this Malbec is a full-throttle wine with huge aromas of blackberry and cassis. This version is a bit more narrow and linear than in the past, but it's still excellent. Flavors of oak-based vanilla and coconut sit on top of vivacious berry fruit, while chocolate cake and coconut are the key flavors on a large, lusty finish. Drink through 2018.",Las Divas Vineyard Gran,92,35.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Riglos
52365,New Zealand,"The Pioneer Block series from Saint Clair remains a reference point for Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. This year, I had a slight preference for Block 3 from the low-lying Dillons Point subregion.

52366,US,"Just the ninth reserve made in the winery's 23 vintages, this is densely aromatic, powerful Cabernet, just at the beginning of what should be a long life. It's tight and astringent, textural and balanced, with a cassis core, and a gravelly, grainy, espresso-flavored finish, still quite tannic.",Reserve,92,75.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Seven Hills
52367,US,"Showing impeccable elegance, this is totally dry and tart in acidity, with a quietly tannic astringency that suggests pairing with lamb or steak. While it's not an ager, the cola, pomegranate, cherry and mushroom flavors are classic and complex.",,92,52.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
52368,Spain,"Earthy aromas of baked plum and raspberry set up a lively palate with bright, persistent acids and a full body. Baked but still vital flavors of plum, berry and spice finish with notes of cocoa, herbs and tomato. This is an elegant Priorat with lasting snap.

52370,Spain,"Cool berry, graphite, cola and prune are the lead aromas on this ripe RDD. In the mouth, choppy tannins and firm acids create a strong, edgy feel. Flavors of cassis, wild berry, coconut and vanilla announce ripeness and plenty of oak. It finishes with abrupt tannins, tons of residual flavor and weight.

52372,US,"On first sniff, the French oak veneers the underlying brooding scent of black currant preserves. But with patience, the oak integrates to reveal details of incense, cumin seed and cocoa. This blend features a lush mouthfeel, which is bolstered by mighty tannins that act as a crescendo across the palate. It's a bruiser of a wine, yet despite the elevated alcohol it feels balanced and maintains superb finesse. Give it an hour or two in a decanter or several years in a cellar.",Boisseau,92,40.0,Virginia,Virginia,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Linden
52373,Italy,"From the family firm that resurrected native grape Greco, this structured, elegant wine offers rich peach, apple and citrus flavors accented with intense mineral, spice and aromatic herbs. Crisp acidity beautifully balances the rich flavors. Drink 2017–2022.",Novaserra,92,25.0,Southern Italy,Greco di Tufo,,Greco,Mastroberardino
52374,US,"Complex and precise, this lovely Cabernet—blended with 10% Merlot and 3% Malbec—layers cassis, herb, bark, earth and graphite elements within a cigar box coating.

52375,France,"The palest of grey-pink rosés, this is classy, fresh and fragrant. It has a light, orange-zest texture as well as tannins and a mineral edge. Very fresh, it is also worth aging a few months.",Cru Classé Grande Réserve,92,29.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,,Rosé,Château Sainte Marguerite
52376,France,"This is a rich, smooth, vanilla-flavored wine that is impressively ripe while keeping all its freshness.

52378,Argentina,"With robust aromas of cola, coffee, dry leaves and blackberry, this lusty blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc outperforms its reasonable price tag.

52380,US,"Some Cabs go into a dip at the age of five, and this may be one of them. It's a little awkward in structure, with a sharpness of feeling, and the oak isn't integrated with the ripe blackberry fruit. Could emerge and be fine in a couple more years.",,86,42.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Falcor

52386,US,"Pinot Gris can often show a little bit of a tawny blush, as it's a fairly dark-skinned white grape, but this is downright coppery, like a French Rosé. It's closer to an Oregon style than to other Washington Pinot Gris, with fleshy pear-flavored fruit and light hints of cinnamon and baking spices. Gets off to a good start, then falls away quite rapidly into a quick, generic finish.",,86,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Pinot Gris,Maryhill
52387,Argentina,"Quite dark and crusty on the nose, with aromas of road tar and obvious oak. Tough but real on the palate, with big tannins and lip-smacking berry and cherry flavors. Shows more oak character and resin than necessary, and thus the fruit flavors don't fully stack up to such heavy wood. Still, it gets it right more than wrong.",,86,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Melipal
52388,US,"Very rich, with cherry jam, chocolate and pepperspice flavors wrapped into firm tannins. But acidity is quite low, and the wine lacks some vibrancy. Drink now.",The Nth Degree,86,55.0,California,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Merlot,Wente

52390,US,"Airfield's Cabernet Sauvignon shows a little more muscle than its Merlot, with raspberries and spice holding down the center and tannins in better balance. It's not a big wine, but solidly made, with some interesting black olive flavors in the finish.",,85,22.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Airfield Estates
52391,US,"There is something off in the nose, a plastic band-aid scent (a type of brett?) that competes with the otherwise pretty floral and citrus notes. Off-dry, it tastes of lemon oil, citrus and cotton candy, but the finish is not entirely clean.",,85,13.0,Washington,Rattlesnake Hills,Columbia Valley,Riesling,Hudson Shah
52392,Chile,"Quite “varietal” in that it hits with sweaty, nutty grapefruit aromas. Airing allows the white fruit components in the wine to show themselves, and thus lemon and tangerine work the palate. Finishes sort of thin and narrow, with more acidity than body or depth of flavor. Good but on the sharp side.",Reserva,85,13.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Ventisquero
52393,US,"Good, but a bit tough and gritty, with a hard edge of tannins. On the other hand there also is dryness and extremely ripe, jammy blackberry and cherry flavors, as well as sweet oak. Not showing well now, but could benefit from some years in the cellar.",,85,41.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Titus
52394,US,"Right out of the glass, this wine broadcasts classic Viognier scents of citrus blossom, citrus rind and, well, citrus fruit. It's forward and expressive, a bit on the sweet and sugary side, but that goes a long way to cut the bitterness that many Viogniers have in the finish. Drink it well chilled, preferably with hot, spicy foods.",,85,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Viognier,Maryhill
52395,Chile,"Aromas of wet clay, herbs and jammy berry fruit are the opening act. The palate is bulky and sweet, with less-than-precise flavors of red fruits and brown sugar.

52397,Argentina,"A heavy, blocky wine with a dark color and aromas that lean toward raisin and reduced balsamic vinegar. The palate is quite full and slightly syrupy in feel, while the flavors are of boysenberry and dark, toasty oak. Finishes with even more crusty, espresso-like wood flavors, leaving displaced wood as the lasting impression.",Casa,85,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Familia Marguery
52398,US,"Shows beautifully thick, chewy tannins and ripe, intricate wild berry, currant, pepper and herb flavors.

52400,US,"Deerfield is one of the few wineries that holds their Syrah back for so long, but the bottling has varied over the years. The '03, at the age of five-plus, is rich in currant, herb and cocoa-dusted cappuccino flavors, but a little flat.

52402,Argentina,"Aromas of cherry cough drop make the bouquet slightly medicinal, but beyond that it's solid and familiar. Moderate richness on the palate accompanies flavors of butter, strawberry and raspberry. Heat, wood resin and a touch of pickle work the finish. Good wine but it doesn't exactly go the extra mile.",,85,12.0,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Malbec,Bodega Don Bosco
52403,France,"It's hard to like this wine. That doesn't mean it is faulty, it means it seems cold, a very hard-edged style of Pinot Noir. It has the Nuits-St-Georges structure in bucketfuls.

The wine is chewy and succulent in the mouth with firm tannins that will soften with time. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.",Sorano,94,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Claudio Alario
52502,Italy,"This year's best expression from the celebrated Rabajà cru, Bruno Rocca presents a beautifully integrated Barbaresco that shows equal parts fruit (prune, plum and cassis) and spice (vanilla, root beer and clove). The wine is smooth, silky and very enduring on the close with excellent structure. Drink after 2015.",Rabajà,94,,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Bruno Rocca
52503,France,"The beauty of Krug's rosé is the sense of bottle age, of that extra richness. That means the wine is not just the sum of its delicious red berry fruits. It's also the way the wine is rounded out, filled with secondary flavors, toast and almonds and a taut minerality. The aftertaste is taut, dry, seamless, complex.",Brut Rosé,94,400.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Krug
52504,France,"With its minimum of six years' bottle aging, this is a beautifully integrated, mature wine. It has a wonderful toast character, layered over sliced pears and ripe acidity. With its complex poise between lightness and richness, this remains an intensely impressive wine.",Grande Cuvée Brut,94,180.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Krug
52505,Italy,"Here's an excellent measuring stick with which to gauge some of the world's best Nebbiolo-based wines. This bright Barolo from the Sarmassa cru delivers textbook aromatic nuances of small berry, cinnamon, dried currants, licorice and balsam freshness. Tight tannins and a fine texture will enable longevity. Cellar this wine ten years or more.",Sarmassa,94,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Marchesi di Barolo
52506,US,"With a pretty pink-salmon color, this Pinot Noir-based blush is rich and full-bodied. It has considerable weight for a bubbly, but the acidity and freshness and yeasty tang lift it up to Champagne elegance. Impossible not to fall in love with this raspberry-scented beauty, but why wouldn't you want to?",Brut Rosé,94,41.0,California,North Coast,North Coast,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg
52507,Italy,"Here's a super-modern, piacione (roughly translated from the Italian as “no one can resist it”) wine with deep layers of vanilla, toast, roasted espresso bean, blackberry, balsam notes, smoke, spice and tar. The wine is thick and soft in the mouth and almost ready to drink now (or in five years). The finish is delicious with a long cherry-flavored fade.",Rocchettevino,94,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Viberti
52508,Italy,"This is an impressive Barolo by a wine company (with superstar consulting enologist Carlo Ferrini at the head of winemaking) that is relatively new to the scene. Due Corti proves this winery knows what it's doing. Aromas of red rose, violet and exotic spice come forward immediately. Indeed, this is an extremely floral and perfumed wine with silky, smooth tannins.",Due Corti,94,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Tenute Costa
52509,Italy,"Executed in a plump, modern style (the wine is aged in small oak barrique), this delicious cru expression from Barbaresco is truly irresistible. The extraction is dark, thick and redolent of cherry, currant, blackberry, vanilla, spice and cinnamon. In the mouth, it is generous, smooth and long-lasting. This wine will appeal to modernists more than traditionalists.",Montersino,94,45.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Orlando Abrigo
52510,Italy,"This is a rich and beautifully extracted Barolo that opens with concentrated aromas of toasted hazelnut, chocolate fudge, cherry, licorice and exotic spice. In the mouth, it offers firm, finely textured tannins and a powerful but delicious finish.",Margheria,94,94.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Massolino
52511,France,"A beautifully balanced wine, with bitter cherries in a core of dry toast. It is already mature, its freshness transformed into a rich texture. Like many rosé Champagnes, this is made for food.",Dom Pérignon Rosé Brut,94,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Moët & Chandon
52512,US,"Such are the tannins in this 100% Cab that it demands cellar time. It's really shut down and astringent in youth, which emphasizes the dryness. But it's very fine, with a solid core of ripe black cherry fruit that will express its sweetness when the tannins melt away. Winemaker Amy Aiken is really showing her stuff with this polished ager. Best 2013–2019.",Morisoli Vineyard,94,120.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Meander
52513,Italy,"Wow, what a wonderful wine, delivering rich notes of black fruit, vanilla, cherry and spice. But the aromas are in no way obvious. In fact, this is an ethereal and elegant wine that pays attention to the little details,   like the light shadings of polished stone and violets that liven up the long finish. Drink after 2018.",Cascina Nuova,94,45.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Elvio Cogno
52514,Italy,"Here's a fantastic addition to your cellar collection of Barolos. Gianfranco Alessandria's San Giovanni Barolo is at the top of its class. The wine is elegant and ethereal with dark, spicy concentration and loads of pulpy fruit, licorice, ginger, cola and leather. Open this bottle in ten years or so.",San Giovanni,94,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Gianfranco Alessandria
52515,US,"This 100% Cabernet's dark, saturated color testifies to its extracted ripeness and richness. It's a gigantic wine, buried at the moment under smoky oak, but tremendous underneath in blackberry, cherry, currant, sweet herb, violet and cured meat flavors. A big success even in this vintage. Now, with decanting, and through 2019.",Campbell Vineyard,94,75.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Honig
52516,Italy,"Nei Cannubi from Poderi Einaudi is textbook Barolo; the kind of wine you can bank on for an elegant and enlightening drinking experience. You see that, here, all the elements are perfectly in place and stacked for maximum pleasure. Aromas of blue flower, berry and shaved mineral build in intensity and the wine is determined and persistent on the palate.",Nei Cannubi,94,100.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Poderi Luigi Einaudi
52517,US,"The best things about this Merlot are its extreme dryness, tannin integrity and relative austerity. It's a pleasure to drink a Merlot that's not a fruit bomb. That doesn't mean you won't find complex flavors of blackberries and currants. You will. It means that this extraordinary Merlot is pushing the envelope on what California, and Napa Valley in particular, is able to achieve in making Merlot along classically structured lines.",Estate,94,50.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Merlot,White Cottage Ranch
52518,Italy,"Dark in color with a modern style and velvety extraction, the gorgeous Marcenasco expression of Barolo is redolent of blackberries, cherries, spice, leather and tobacco. The finish is long and elegant but not without power and determination. Keep this wine cellared for ten years plus.",Marcenasco,94,50.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Renato Ratti
52519,Italy,"Riserva Barolo Prapò delivers modern oak tones followed by nice integrity of fruit and well-integrated aromas of spice, prune, blackberry and cola. The mouthfeel is very velvety and smooth and the tannins show an extreme fine grain quality. Hold ten years or more.",Prapò Riserva,94,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Schiavenza
52520,US,"There's a tannic toughness to this young wine. It's like chewing on dried black currants. Once they start to dissolve in the mouth, lovely flavors of sweet blackberries emerge, and then take over through a very long, spicy finish. It's quite a beautiful Napa Cabernet, but it does need time. Best 2013–2019.",,94,82.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alpha Omega
52521,Italy,"Impressive on so many levels, this vineyard designate Riserva Barolo shows excellent aromatic intensity and purity. Black cherry, plum, smoke, spice, asphalt, root beer and black tar are evident elements of the bouquet. The mouthfeel is full, firm and generous with a lingering vanilla fade.",Bricco Rocca Riserva Tistot,94,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Cascina Ballarin
52522,Italy,"Barolo Riva is a fantastic wine with enormous personality and charm. At the outset, the wine appears modern and bold with determined aromas of black fruit and spice. But wait a second and the wine will surprise you with its sassy complexity and finesse. Give it 10 more years of cellar aging. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.",Riva,94,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Claudio Alario
52523,US,"Made in the Heirloom style, which is huge, extracted and potent. The '07 shows the preternatural ripeness of the vintage, offering massive cherry and black raspberry fruit, along with sizable tannins. The winemaker has framed this power with considerable oak. The result admittedly is seismic, but it is another success for Heirloom, and is likely to age for at least a dozen years.",Heirloom,94,90.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Etude
52524,US,"Rich, concentrated, and loaded with smoky, dark, spicy fruit flavors, this is a full-on Bordeaux blend, with Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. There's plenty of barrel influence, from 70% new French oak, but it's welcome, and appropriate, perfectly matched to the power of the fruit. An underlayer of woodsy earth and mushroom adds further complexity.",Minnick Hills Reserve,94,60.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dumas Station
52525,France,"A beautiful orange pink-colored wine. Young and fresh, it has great depth of raspberry and red fruit flavors as well as a delicious summer fruit brightness and liveliness. A beautiful Champagne, that will repay some bottle aging.",Rosé Brut,94,67.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Louis Roederer
52526,US,"Here's a vintage-driven wine that needs the right conditions to succeed, which 2006 provided with its long, cool hangtime. The fruit has ripened to perfection, offering deep flavor notes of blackberries and raspberries. But there are also exotic and delicious notes of bacon, mocha and cola with a blast of black pepper throughout. The wine is full-bodied and dense in tannins, impressive from start to finish. Great now, and should age for 4–6 years.",Wildcat Mountain Vineyard,94,34.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Syrah,MacRostie
52527,Italy,"Barolo La Serra from Gianni Voerzio would make a perfect companion to pulled pork smoked over hardwood charcoal. There's a sassy spice element here backed by plush layers of blueberry, blackberry and plum. The tannins are still on the young, astringent side; give this wine some time to unwind in the cellar.",La Serra,94,100.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Gianni Voerzio
52528,Italy,"Barolo Ornato is a beautiful wine: rich in flavor, intensity and personality. You can taste the quality of the fruit here thanks to the pristine notes of cherry, wild berry, spice and ginger that emerge from the nose. Oak notes of vanilla and cinnamon are nicely integrated and folded within the wine's dense, supple texture.",Ornato,94,109.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Pio Cesare
52529,US,"Top lots from Sheridan, Dineen and Meek vineyard grapes go into this reserve. This is always the most thick and dense of the Stevens wines, and the tannins, though very well managed, are chewy and substantial. They dominate this young wine, but the stacked and subtle layers of red and black fruits, leaf and forest floor materials, moist earth and ashes keep the flavors complex and interesting. This wine absolutely must be decanted, and can be cellared almost indefinitely.",XY Reserve,94,42.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stevens
52530,South Africa,"The sweet edge to this sparkler makes it quite attractive and a pleasant alternative to the more common dry styles typically served today. The nose offers notes of toast, apple skins and pineapple core while the mouth shows riper flavors of peaches and cream and a hint of honey. Overall, a fun and well-balanced semi-sweet sparkler.",Bliss Demi-Sec,85,16.0,Western Cape,,,Champagne Blend,Graham Beck
52531,US,"Dry, acidic and earthy, lacking the richness you want in a fine Chardonnay. Could almost be a Pinot Grigio, with its crisp citrus and mineral flavors.",,85,21.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Justin
52532,Australia,"Already developed, with hints of toast and marmalade on the nose and showing baked apple and citrus flavors on the palate. This plump, medium-bodied Riesling finishes with a touch of honeyed softness, suggesting it should be consumed over the next year.",The Lost Watch,85,18.0,South Australia,Adelaide,,Riesling,Wirra Wirra
52533,Australia,"Stridently herbal on the nose, with flavors that verge on vegetal, this is nonetheless cleanly made, with enough lemongrass and grapefruit aromas and flavors to merit recommendation. Drink it over the next six months or so.",Y Series,85,10.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Sauvignon Blanc,Yalumba
52534,Chile,"A bit narrow and medicinal, but overall this Cab delivers reasonably good cherry and herbal berry aromas and flavors along with some oak, coconut, citric acid and earth. It's a touch muddled and all over the map, but for $10 it's a pretty good wine.",Crucero,85,10.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Siegel
52535,US,"Lots of rich pineapple, buttered toast, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors in this Chard.

52536,Italy,"Cocconata Libera makes a slightly awkward first impression with sulphur notes that blow off fast enough to reveal cherry cola, raspberries and earthy white mushrooms. Drink now, just decant first.",Cocconato Libera,85,15.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,,Barbera,Bava
52537,Italy,Here's a value wine and a fresh expression of Barbera that can be served with cheeseburgers and fries at an outdoor barbecue. The wine is informal and light and seems to be engineered for immediate consumption.,Castelvero,85,10.0,Piedmont,Piedmont,,Barbera,Araldica
52538,South Africa,"A lovely sparkler at a fantastic price made with organic grapes. The bouquet is fresh and lively with notes of sweet pea florals, pear and peach.

Drink now and with plenty of friends.",The Ruins Brut,85,10.0,Robertson,,,Sparkling Blend,Bon Cap
52539,US,"Very dry, crisp and elegantly structured, this Pinot Noir can be had at a pretty good price. It has modest flavors of cherries, tobacco and spices, but is a little unripe, with hints of green tomato and white pepper.",,85,15.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Irony
52540,New Zealand,"Grassy and herbal, rounded out by sweet pea notes and touches of honey and citrus on the finish, this is a medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc with quaffing appeal. Chill it well to make up for its lack of cut on the finish.",,85,22.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Kennedy Point
52541,New Zealand,"Understated grapefruit and herbal aromas lead the way, framing peach and melon flavors. Round and soft on the palate, then turning a bit chalky on the finish. Drink now.",,85,14.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Jules Taylor
52542,US,"This is a crisp, minerally wine you could drink as an interesting alternative to Sauvignon Blanc. It's rich in citrus, apricot and floral flavors that finish with a honey, fruity flourish. Try with Asian fare.",Silvaspoons Vineyard,85,15.0,California,Alta Mesa,Central Valley,Verdelho,Lee Family Farm

52545,US,"Light in color and tart in acidity, but with ultralight tannins, this pleasant sipper has flavors of spicy cherry pie filling and Dr. Pepper cola. It's a dry wine somewhat like a simple Pinot Noir. Drink now with barbecue.",Karma Vineyard,85,27.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Sangiovese,Cantara
52546,South Africa,"A soft, dry sparkling rosé with modest aromas and flavors of strawberry hull, white cranberry and grapefruit peel. Medium bodied with assertive carbonation and a clean finish. So juicy and refreshing, this would be an excellent choice for brunch or lunch al fresco.",Brut Rosé,85,16.0,Western Cape,,,Champagne Blend,Graham Beck
52547,US,"A bit on the sugary sweet side, but otherwise this is a nice cocktail sipper. Shows good acidity coupled with pineapple, Meyer lemon, lime, green apple and spice flavors. Would score much higher if it were drier.",Redwood Ranch,85,20.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Field Stone
52548,US,"Very dry and tannicly tart, with blackberry, currant and pepper flavors touched with oak. This is a good, everyday wine to drink with rich meat dishes and cheeses.",Steinbeck Vineyard,85,21.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Syrah,Eberle

52551,US,"Tasted just at its official release, this very young Syrah was not in full form. The barrel scents and flavors were not integrated, and the fruit was standard red wine fare. The rather high (15%) alcohol brings neither ripeness nor depth, and the roasted coffee flavors from the barrels quickly take over the finish.",,85,19.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,DaMa
52552,Israel,"The acidity is strong and quite forward in this wine, both in the mouth and on the nose. Red berry preserves and a faint cocoa dusting flesh out the medium-weight mouth, with grainy tannins lingering through the finish.",Kayoumi Single Vineyard Kosher,85,39.0,Upper Galilee,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Carmel
52553,Israel,"Here's an excellent Kosher option for an apéritif or dessert wine, with lovely characteristics of peach preserves, fresh lychee, ripe apricot, rose florals and sweet tangerine citrus. Effervescent and lively on the palate with a clean but lingering finish. Drink up!",Moscato di Carmel Kosher,85,9.0,Samson,,,Moscato,Carmel
52554,Chile,"Melon, apple and pear aromas are far from complex or elevated, but the wine does smell reasonably good. And the palate is wet and fruity, with sweet, slightly candied mango, melon and lemon flavors. Innocuous and like a thousand others from Chile, but for $10 one can't really complain.",,85,10.0,Central Valley,,,Chardonnay,Cono Sur
52555,New Zealand,"A bit disappointing from veteran winemaker Alan McCorkindale, or maybe this is just sliding past its prime. The modest grapefruit notes, herbal overtones and tart finish are fine, but fail to excite. Drink up.",,85,19.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Thatched Hut
52556,New Zealand,"Hints of struck flint and fresh grass accent passion fruit flavors in this plump Sauvignon Blanc. It's at once citrusy and round, soft in texture yet with a mouthpuckering sour tinge to the finish.",,85,16.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Omaka Springs
52557,Italy,"Signed by winemaker Antonio Deltetto, this expression of Barbera shows aged aromas of dried fruit, dusty earth, wild mushroom and cured or smoked meat. It is polished and streamlined and would pair with cooked prunes wrapped in thinly sliced prosciutto.",Trifola,85,,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Oriel
52558,Australia,"Slightly chunky in texture, this value-priced Pinot Grigio offers up a mouthful of pulpy apple and pear fruit, but not a lot of nuance or sophistication. Fine as a weeknight apéritif or alongside grilled chicken.",,85,8.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Pinot Grigio,Oxford Landing
52559,Chile,"Admittedly the early aromas are gaseous and rubbery, but the mouthfeel is fine and the flavors of cassis, fresh tomato and cocoa powder are about as good as any reasonable person could expect for $6. A competent wine that's above average for the price.",,85,6.0,Curicó Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Quasar
52560,US,"An interesting, even eccentric Syrah that's really quite different from anything else out there. No mere fruit bomb, it's a meaty wine, in the sense of being chewy, but also in the aromas and flavors of both roasted and raw beef. That's not to mention the extraordinary blackberries and currants, dusted with a blast of freshly ground black pepper. First-class and unique.",Rosella's Vineyard,94,48.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Syrah,Zepaltas
52561,US,"This bottling is always quite good, but it excels in 2006. Shows lusher, more exotic notes than ever before, just oozing in tiers of black and red cherry compote, currants, mocha, cinnamon, anise and pepper flavors. Finishes thoroughly dry, a beautifully crafted Pinot that will change your mind about Paso Robles.",HMR Estate,94,30.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Adelaida
52562,US,"Gigantic, huge. Just erupts with the most intense cassis, chocolate and smoky new oak. Classic Howell Mountain structure, with dense, sweet young tannins and firm acidity. So immature, it's sappy and jammy now, and is sorely in need of cellaring. Don't touch before 2011, and should provide enjoyment for many years after.",Bancroft Ranch Vineyard,94,75.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Merlot,Beringer
52563,US,"Bold and forward, this estate-grown Syrah fairly explodes with scents of game, cured meat and smoke. The black cherry and cassis fruit forms a dense and sappy core; as the wine skips across the tongue nuances of tobacco, sweet leather, chocolate and spices come into play. It just keeps on going, adding caramel and peppery chocolate through an evolving and satisfying finish.",RiverBend Vineyard,94,40.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Fielding Hills
52564,US,"Greg La Follette, who made this wine, understands the Van der Kamp vineyard, where this wine comes from, better than anyone. It's a startling wine, rich and full-bodied, yet utterly delicious in youthful appeal. With a fine, dry structure, it offers enormous flavors of cherries, raspberries, currants, mocha, cinnamon and smoky oak, and the finish lasts for a full minute. Expensive, but all the proceeds are for charity.",Greg La Follette Van de Kamp Vineyard,94,100.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lookout Ridge
52565,France,"This is powerful, typical of Les Preuses. White and yellow fruits are important to the palate, but so are rich, honeyed toast, minerality and an opulent, intense concentration. This is impressive, elegance with power, and worth aging for several years.",Les Preuses Grand Cru,94,67.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,La Chablisienne
52566,US,"More powerful and potent than the '04, this simply has more juice, more depth, more power and more detail than any previous Sheridan wine. The fruit is exceptional—dense black cherry and cassis, with a sense of compact layering that promises great aging potential. This was 30 months in oak but does not seem oaky in any way. It already has the balance, the polish and the length to justify long-term cellaring. Tannins are ripe and supple, bringing in hints of dried herb and black olive.",Reserve,94,75.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sheridan Vineyard
52567,France,"Sumptuous and rich, a fully gorgeous Chardonnay, with butter and citrus flavors combining with panache. The wine just fill the mouth, a succession of pineapple, soft toast, spice and mango flavors, finished with acidity. To drink now, but it is worth keeping for 2–3 years.",Les Charmes Premier Cru,94,99.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Xavier Monnot
52568,France,"The high toast aromas, typical of Chanson wines, can be off-putting. But get beyond the wood, which needs a couple more years to integrate, and the ripe fruit of 2005 gives this wine density and character. The yellow fruits, ripe cantaloupe melon flavor and sweet acidity will more than hold their own against the wood.",,94,235.0,Burgundy,Corton Vergennes,,Chardonnay,Chanson Père et Fils
52569,Chile,"The price for one of Chile's flagship wines keeps climbing, but fortunately so does the quality. Winemaker Enrique Tirado has crafted yet another pounding, saturated Cabernet. It's wonderfully meshed yet potent and fierce. Boysenberry, cassis and kirsch flavors control the extracted palate, while the finish is warm, creamy and fun, sort of like a milkshake. At 14.5%, Melchor is at its max. Hold until 2010 and then drink through 2015.",Don Melchor,94,80.0,Puente Alto,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Concha y Toro
52570,France,"A rich, mouthfilling,  sophisticated wine. The secret is in the balance, with the concentrated fruit flavors—dried apricot, mango and lemon—in just the right proportion. It tastes delicious now, but will certainly age over five years or more.",Les Pucelles Premier Cru,94,273.0,Burgundy,Puligny-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Domaine Leflaive
52571,US,"Smells young and juvenile, a bit raw. Shows briary aromas of wild berries, thyme, cherries and mocha. A chewy wine, tannic and spicy.

52572,France,"The Château Grenouilles vineyard, wholly owned by members of the La Chablisienne cooperative, is in the upper part of Grenouilles Grand Cru. As such, this is major Chablis, a wine that needs maybe 10 years' aging.

52573,US,"This bottling has been a star for Simi since its inception, and the '05 is among their best ever. It shows Alexander Valley's softness and slight herbaceousness, along with decadently rich red currant, mocha and oak flavors. Classic and elegant now, it should develop bottle complexities for the next six years. This is a good price, especially compared to what's going on in Napa Valley.",Landslide Vineyard,94,35.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Simi
52574,US,"A brilliant Pinot Noir, grown organically from the winery's new vineyard in a cool part of the coastal mountains. More tannic and acidic than Pinots from the estate vineyard in Green Valley, it offers lush, deep flavors of cherries, black raspberries, gingersnap cookies and almond biscotti. Just terrific, and will take a few years of bottle age in a cool cellar.",Mas Cavalls Doña Margarita Vineyard,94,49.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
52575,US,"This barrel-selection bottling honors the winemaker's father-in-law, and comes from the best lots of Syrah.

It opens elegantly into a smooth, almost silky finish, adding sweet chocolate to the mix.",John Lewis,94,65.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Gramercy
52576,France,"This is a rare venture by Olivier Leflaive outside his home territory around Puligny, Chassagne and Meursault. The wine is classic Corton-Charlemagne, big and bold, a broad-shouldered wine that brings together toastiness, ripe pineapple and mango and balancing, lively acidity. It is already giving great pleasure, but should last well over the next decade.",,94,150.0,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne,,Chardonnay,Olivier Leflaive
52577,US,"Made from 100% Cab, this wine pours inky black, and feels softly ripe in the mouth, with pie-filling blackberries, cherries, mocha, plums, tobacco and sweet dusty spices.

52578,France,"This steely, mineral, structured wine speaks of the chalk soil of Puligny. It is firm and crisp, even though the fruit is rich.

52579,France,"There is a definite richness to this wine, the ripe white fruit and melon flavors aided by a judicious amount of vanilla and toast. That makes the wine seductive, but Laroche does not forget its Chablis origins and leaves enough room for a core of grapefruit, steel and tight acidity.

As it softens, more red fruits will come to the front, although the structure will remain, making this a serious rosé for drinking with food.",Bonbon,92,29.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire,,Rosé,Domaine des Diables
52663,France,The palest of rosés is also a serious wine. It has a firm and mineral character that goes along with ripe red fruits and a tight texture. It needs to age for a few months and is really meant to go with food.,Château Romassan,92,45.0,Provence,Bandol,,Rosé,Domaines Ott
52664,US,"Akin to a fresh basket of strawberries picked up at the farmer's market, this Grenache Rosé is intensely floral and fruity. A touch of blood orange peeks through, along with a flirty herbal streak and dry, soft textures. Light and bright, it offers a slight effervescence.",Isabel's Cuvée,92,26.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Rosé,Donkey & Goat
52665,US,"The intriguing golden-pink color looks like sun shining through a rose petal, and the aromas of honey, buttered popcorn and pecan pie are just as appealing. Once sipped, the flavors of poached salmon somehow show. These continue into a long finish, although the acidity soon wipes the slate clean like a good rosé should. This is one of many wines made by ninth-generation Santa Maria Valleyite James Ontiveros.",Rosé,92,18.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Alta Maria
52666,US,"Sophisticated and complex, this terroir-specific wine artfully blends herbal components—green tea, chamomile and mint—with tart red fruit flavors of pomegranate, raspberry, and bramble. The blend is 43% Merlot, 38% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Cabernet Franc and 2% Malbec.",Two Blondes Vineyard,92,55.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Andrew Will
52667,US,"Drinking quite nicely at the moment, this is a generous, dense wine with a full complement of dark fruits, cacao, smoke and hints of black tea. From the opening aromatics on through a seamless weave of fruit and barrel flavors, this is irresistibly delicious.",Reserve,92,40.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Barnard Griffin
52668,US,"This flamboyant Cab is pretty oaky, but enormously powerful in fruits, especially red currants and chocolate. The overall depth and complexity make it a beauty. Drink now–2018.",District Collection,92,85.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Raymond
52669,Spain,"Blueberry, savory plum and lemony oak are the key aromas on this firmly structured RDD. Flavors of blackened toast, blackberry, pepper and creamy oak finish pure, strong and long, with mint, licorice and chocolaty residual notes. Drink through 2022.",,92,90.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Alion
52670,South Africa,"This blend of 66% Shiraz, 16% Mourvèdre, 14% Grenache and 4% Cinsault is pure and balanced, with an immediately perceptable core of brambly berry that's accented by notes of white pepper, charred cedar, forest floor and cocoa nib. The medium-weight palate is fleshy yet firm, with spiced-fruit flavors and structured tannins. It's certainly drinkable now, but this will continue to mature and evolve nicely through 2018.",,92,45.0,Swartland,,,Rhône-style Red Blend,A.A. Badenhorst Family Wines
52671,Argentina,"The color is deep purple, the nose dense, alluring and hinting at mint, shoe polish, violet and blackberry. Flavors are pure, modestly oaky and deep in terms of wild berry, coffee and chocolate.",Reserva,92,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Durigutti
52672,France,"After an extra year's aging, this wine's richness is very apparent. It may have lost immediate freshness but it has gained in ripe fruits, in texture and in depth. It's a complex wine worth pairing with food.",Estandon Légende,92,23.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,,Rosé,Estandon
52673,US,"It invigorates the senses with concentrated lemon and lime flavors tinged with minerals, tart stone fruits and blossoms. It's dry in style with a bold, mouth-filling palate, but gorgeously elegant. Finishes long with a ripple of lime-zest astringency.",Magdalena Vineyard Dry Estate Bottled and Grown,92,36.0,New York,Seneca Lake,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Hermann J. Wiemer
52674,Spain,"Black in color and concentrated on the nose, this Tinta de Toro overflows with cassis and blackberry aromas. The palate is lively and lifted, with plenty of acidity and kick. Flavors of cassis and dark berries are charged up and toasty, while chocolate notes, firm tannins and a gritty edge define the finish. Drink through 2018.",Almirez,92,26.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
52675,Spain,"Dry, schisty aromas of cherry and spice are reserved and elevated. This is a bright wine with juicy acidity and complexity. Flavors of baked berry fruits are minerally at the core, while the finish is smooth, mature and steady, with lasting purity. Drink through 2019.",Mas Mallola,92,50.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Marco Abella
52676,New Zealand,"Hand-picked, whole-cluster pressed, barrel-fermented—this represents one of the directions forward-thinking NZ Sauvignon Blanc producers are pursuing. It's fully ripe and velvety in texture, with toasty, nutty notes but no obvious vanilla overtones, as only used oak is employed. Peach and nectarine flavors finish long and citrusy.",OTQ,92,22.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Jules Taylor
52677,US,"The winery has been quietly building up a solid track record with this bottling, and with the 2009, they've produced their best yet. The wine is gigantic in every respect. Vast, deep flavors of roasted coffee bean, blackberry, currant, violets and dark chocolate are complex, with plenty of toasted oak in the bargain. The tannins are strong, strong, strong, numbing the palate. While nobody can assure you it has a longterm future, this should evolve nicely with time; drink through 2022.",Black Bart Stagecoach Vineyard,92,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,Krupp Brothers
52678,US,"This Sangiovese was as usual co-fermented with Syrah (13%), and sourced from a mix of estate vineyards. Smooth and supple, it's a sweetly appealing wine, loaded with strawberry preserves, but also detailed with impressive notes of Italian herbs and a whiff of tomato paste. As befits the variety, the underpinning of natural acidity lifts the finish beautifully, and suggests aging it through 2020.",,92,65.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sangiovese,Leonetti Cellar
52679,US,"Sadly, it's the last vintage for this single-vineyard Chardonnay. It captures the subtle blend of yellow and green berries and apples, with superior length and detail. Delicately nuanced barrel flavors bring in hazelnut and cookie characteristics. This has the exceptional acidity to age, despite going through complete malolactic fermentation.",Au Contraire French Creek Vineyard,92,25.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Maison Bleue
52680,US,"A little sharp and minty, but pleases for its savory flavors of cherries and oak. This is decent wine for folks who want a Pinot experience but don't want to pay a Pinot price.",,85,12.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Castle Rock
52681,Argentina,"Light and waxy on the nose, with touches of custard, lychee and banana. This is not a driving, varietally convincing Torrontés, but it is balanced and refreshing. The flavors of melon and apple are solid, while the finish is quick but nice. Drink right away and it shouldn't be a disappointment.",,85,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Torrontés,Bodega Norton
52682,France,Red cherries and jelly fruits highlight a wine that is ripe and soft. A hint of acidity puts the sweetness into attractive relief.,,85,25.0,Burgundy,Bourgogne,,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils
52683,Australia,"Light and fresh, this 100% Chardonnay sparkler features slightly gingery, briny, biscuity aromas and crisp, balanced finish. At the price, the only serious competition is Cava, with its decidedly different flavors.",dB Sparkling Brut,85,10.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Sparkling Blend,De Bortoli
52684,Argentina,"Plump and fruity on the nose, but it also smells entirely familiar and generic. Like most Argentine Cabernets, this wine is tight, tannic and full of cassis and other berry fruits. What it's not is elegant, complex or different than the masses. If you like bold but basic berry flavors, tannic bite and chocolate on the finish, this is for you.",Remolinos Vineyard,85,21.0,Mendoza Province,Agrelo,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca Decero
52685,US,"This is a pleasantly fruity wine, with tangy cherry fruit limned with some herbal, earthy tannins. Hints of tobacco and vanilla are there, but the wine quickly shows rather harsh, chalky acids that descend into a bitter, herbal finish.",Proprietor's Reserve,85,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Maryhill
52686,Australia,"A decidedly earthy wine, with cola and coffee flavors accented by hints of vanilla and cherry. It's a bit chunky and lacking elegance, finishing with more coffee and dark fruit elements. Maybe it will improve with age, but it's a bit of a gamble. Imported by Lion Nathan USA.",No. 8,85,40.0,New South Wales,Orange,,Pinot Noir,Philip Shaw
52687,France,"A fresh, very strawberry and plum skin flavored Pinot Noir from Irancy, a small area near Auxerre and close to Chablis. The wine has some weight because of the vintage, which gives ripeness and an edge of rusticity. It's certainly more than just a curiosity.",,85,20.0,Burgundy,Irancy,,Pinot Noir,Simonnet-Febvre
52688,US,"Ripe, fruity and oaky, in the modern style, this Chard shows vanilla and butterscotch-tinged flavors of candied pineapples and honey.",,85,15.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Rutherford Ranch
52689,US,"Has some green tomato flavors and minty tannins that give an astringent feel to the otherwise plush cherry and cola fruit. Good and dry, but lacks some stuffing and complexity and ripeness.",Edna Ranch Lily Gil,85,48.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Tolosa
52690,Australia,"A cooperative effort of six growers in the Hunter Valley, this is in the region's traditional savory, meaty-leathery style. Cola, earth and spice flavors are accented by hints of mint, while the mouthfeeel is full and slightly creamy. Pretty good, but could use more length on the finish. Imported by America Uncorked.",,85,20.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,Shiraz,The Six Masters
52691,US,"For a $15 Washington Merlot, this offers fair value. Despite the earthy, slightly stemmy tannins, the wine has substantial fruit flavors of cranberry and pie cherry, and the acids give it some extra lift. This will go well with fatty meats and grilled steaks.",,85,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Maryhill
52692,France,"A strangely spicy aroma is followed on the palate by very dry tannins, which dominate the red fruits. The wine has some potential, but has obviously come from grapes that are on the tart side. The finish has high acidity.",,85,,Burgundy,Côtes de Nuits Villages,,Pinot Noir,Pierre Olivier
52693,US,"Here's a fine Merlot that can stand beside a nice steak, and won't break the bank. It's drily tannic, with currant, cherry and licorice flavors that finish in a swirl of peppery spices. Drink now.",,85,13.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Pavilion
52694,US,"A bit sweet and rugged, with jammy blackberry, currant and pepper spice flavors wrapped into firm tannins. Shows Zin's briary, brambly character.",BFD,85,36.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Peachy Canyon
52695,US,"A soft, easy Zin, ready to drink now. With finely ground tannins, it has flavors of blackberries, orange rind, dark chocolate, black pepper and all sorts of dusty Asian spices.",Hopland Ranches,85,22.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Zinfandel,Brutocao
52696,Argentina,"Quite neutral and distant on the nose, with dry apple flavors working the soft, balanced palate. There are complexities such as white pepper and nutty nuances, but in the end it's an average sparkler with a controlled approach. Good for Argentina but probably not ready to compete with the world's best $20 sparkling wines.",Cuvée Speciale,85,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Sparkling Blend,Cave Extrême
52697,Argentina,"Opens with mildly gassy, rubbery aromas that suggest reduction or brett. Once it airs out, however, it's a good, generic Cabernet with familiar flavors of black fruits, mocha and chocolate. It's a little herbal and lean across the palate and onto the finish, but for run-of-the-mill everyday Cab it does the trick.",Estate Bottled,85,12.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca El Portillo
52698,Argentina,"Standard plum and berry aromas provide a nice opening to this dark, solid Malbec that's a little zingy and racy at its core. Flavors of plum and berry are typical for a wine of this class, which finishes with burnt flavors and a final resting place of grainy oak.",,85,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Durigutti
52699,US,"A good, everyday sort of Zin, dry and fruity. It has a rich tannic structure, with spicy cherry, tangerine, currant, cola and cocoa flavors.",,85,18.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Folie à Deux
52700,Chile,"Nearly colorless as well as crisp and racy, this SB from northerly Limarí starts with snappy lime, white grapefruit and orange aromas. Reflecting its cooler origin, it is sharp as far as acidity goes, with a short, flashy finish. A little scouring but still good. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC.",,85,10.0,Limarí Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Tamaya
52701,US,"Dry and fruity, but a little brittle in tannins and acids, this Merlot has red currant, mocha, cinnamon and smoky oak flavors. Drink now.",,85,37.0,California,San Luis Obispo County,Central Coast,Merlot,Silver Stone Winery
52702,US,"Though labeled reserve, this is barely distinguishable from the winery's regular Cabernet. More toast, and a little chocolate is showing, but the fruit flavors—pale blackberry and black currant—are quickly covered up by the aggressive tannins.",Reserve,85,32.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Airfield Estates
52703,US,"Babcock continues to be challenged with ripeness in their Cabs. This '06 has weedy, mint and Tabasco flavors alongside the oak-inspired currants. Drink now.",New Epoch Reserve,85,40.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Babcock
52704,US,"Very ripe and oaky, what this wine may lack in subtlety it makes up for in sheer power. Bursts with ripe, candied pineapple and lemon honey flavors that finish sweet.",Reserve,85,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Louis M. Martini
52705,US,"Dry and astringent, this Cab offers drink-me-now flavors of currants, cherries, herbs and oak. It's quite tannic, needing a rich steak to tame it.",Reserve Selection,85,16.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hayman & Hill
52706,US,"Much like the 2005 Hogue Reserve, this is a deep gold and fragrant with candied pineapple, buttered nuts and toast. It's big and rich and forward, but also a bit clunky and one dimensional, without the subtlety to offset the oak. Feels just a bit oxidized, as if aging rather quickly.",Reserve,85,24.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Hogue
52707,France,"A wine that seems to take the softness of Chambolle-Musigny too far. It has sweetness and flavors of raspberry juice, leaving no room for structure or acidity. Drink now, because this wine is too open to last.",Les Bussières,85,75.0,Burgundy,Chambolle-Musigny,,Pinot Noir,Maison Champy
52708,Argentina,"Slightly carbonic and gassy at first, with huge candied fruit aromas. But quickly the wine settles, and out comes sweet blackberry flavors and some gumminess. It's a chunky, easy wine with medium tannins and modest plushness, which is something you shouldn't necessarily expect from a value-positioned wine. Short on the finish, but plump and buttery.",,85,12.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Finca El Portillo
52709,Australia,"This is a medium-bodied, somewhat chunky Pinot Noir, but does manage to combine plummy aromas with distinctively Pinot-like sous-bois character. The flavors turn tart and savory, ending on a pomegranate note.",Windy Peak,85,15.0,Victoria,Victoria,,Pinot Noir,De Bortoli
52710,US,"There's a lovely dryness and elegance of mouthfeel to this Pinot Noir that make it instantly appealing. True, it could be richer. But for the price and case availability, it's a pretty polished wine. Shows tart, bitter cherry, cranberry and cola flavors, with a deft touch of smoky oak.",,87,23.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Husch
52711,US,"The bubbles are a little scoury on this delightfully dry rosé, which makes it feel rough in the mouth. Aside from that, it's rich and complex in orange, strawberry, vanilla and yeasty flavors.",Brut Rosé,87,28.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery
52712,US,"While soft on the nose with a generous dose of cooked black fruit, Jamesport's Bloc E is surprisingly crisp and lean on the palate.

52713,France,"Warm and rounded wine, with almond flavor and the ripe red fruits to go with the intense and balancing acidity. The wine is rich, while also well textured, giving fine final acidity.",Perle de Nuit Blanc de Noirs Brut,87,22.0,Burgundy,Crémant de Bourgogne,,Pinot Noir,Louis Bouillot
52714,US,"Dense and bold in fruit and cinnamon spice, a whopper of a wine from Virginia. Full bodied with richly extracted blueberry, blackberry, and dried fig flavors, it could use a few years to smooth out all the grippy tannins.

52717,US,"This Bordeaux blend, based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec, is a little sweet in blackberries, cassis, plum jam, milk chocolate and spicy sandalwood, but the sweetness is balanced by acidity and rich tannins.

52718,US,"Crushed grains of paradise and dried tarragon add a spicy dimension to softer, sweeter notes of graham cracker and sweet red fruit on the palate of Knapp's Cabernet Franc.

52721,US,"Lots of delicious, complex blackberry, crème de cassis, mineral and cedar flavors in this dry, tannic wine. One quibble is the acidity, which is overly sharp and feels odd, given how ripe the wine is.",Stagecoach Vineyard,87,55.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jean Edwards

52742,Spain,"Opens with hard, ripe, almost forced aromas, which settle with air. The palate is wiry, firm and a touch hot, with cola, raspberry and plum flavors that rattle around on a bed of racy acidity.

52841,US,"Shows the spicy flavors of Mendocino Gewürztraminer, with citrus, tropical fruit and wildflower notes that have a tangy finish of minerals and acids. The wine is a bit simple and sweet, although the price is pretty good.",,84,12.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Gewürztraminer,Gewurz
52842,US,"Lots to like in this Lake County wine. It's very crisp in acidity and clean, with a minerally scour to the lemon, lime and kiwi flavors. On the minus side, it's rather sweet, which gives it a fruit juice quality.",100% Musque Clone,84,15.0,California,Red Hills Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Sauvignon Blanc,Fortress
52843,US,"This is a rather sweet bubbly made from indeterminate varieties the winery doesn't reveal. It's clean and zesty, with tropical fruit, green grape and vanilla flavors.",,84,12.0,California,California,California Other,Sparkling Blend,Ca' Secco
52844,US,"A tasty, simple and rather sweet wine. It has fruit juice flavors of pineapples, mangoes, apricots and peaches.",The Angel's Fare Saralee's Vineyard,84,30.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Marsanne-Roussanne,Lionheart

52846,South Africa,"Immediate aromas of chalk and peach waft up from the glass, followed by flavors of green lime and asparagus in the round mouth. The finish is a little heavy, but the flavors are nice and it should be a nice companion to summery soups and grilled vegetables.",,84,11.0,Western Cape,,,Sauvignon Blanc,MAN Vintners
52847,Italy,"Here's a bright, ruby-colored Barbera with a vertical and immediate delivery of aromas of red apple, forest fruit and white almond. Those apple notes appear again in the mouth and the wine is crisp on the close.",,84,,Piedmont,Barbera del Monferrato,,Barbera,Mario Garrone
52848,US,"Strongly herbal, with scents and flavors of leaf, root and stem. The flavors are more toward grass and herb than berry or fruit. It's got a peppery finish, pleasant but could be a little riper.",Roller Girl Red,84,17.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,SuLei
52849,US,"Bone dry and crisp in acidity, with a lean minerality in the way of Santa Ynez Sauvignon Blancs, this bottling has vibrant citrus and floral flavors. It's compromised by an unripe, green note that makes it somewhat sour.",Estate Grown,84,20.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Star Lane Vineyard
52850,South Africa,"A pleasant, easy-drinking wine with notes of lemon citrus, white peach and tart melon rind. Balanced and clean with a refreshing finish; a great pair with grilled fish or chicken.",,84,10.0,Robertson,,,Chenin Blanc,Robertson Winery
52851,US,"Delivers Zin's briary, brambly wild berry flavors with the punch of high alcohol, which gives the wine a sweet, hot finish. You should know also that the tannins are hard.

52855,US,"Although this is Ste. Michelle's widely available Merlot offering, it breaks the mold by being held back a considerable time prior to release. It's an unusual wine, with scents of overripe, raisined fruit, a streak of tobacco and black licorice, a soft midpalate, and some bitterness in the finishing tannins.",,84,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Chateau Ste.

52860,US,"This is a new brand and a very good introductory Pinot Noir. In its light, silky mouthfeel and deep, complex flavors, it showcases its Russian River origins in a classic way. Offers up brilliantly ripe flavors of red currants, licorice, cola, gingerbread, mocha and spices, wrapped into a dry, balanced structure. Best now for its youthful charm.",Suacci Vineyard,93,48.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Suacci Carciere Wines
52861,US,"This is just 14.2% alcohol, so despite the richness and ripeness, this is not fat or flabby. The fruit has concentrated black cherry and cassis flavors, and the smoky, pain grillé flavors of barrel aging are nicely integrated. Aromatically this wine is just beginning to evolve, with complex plum, prune, cherry liqueur, coffee and smoke.",Reserve,93,60.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Sheridan Vineyard
52862,US,"Here's one for the cellar. The tannins swamp the mouth, giving a hard, astringent edge.

Best after 2010.",,93,75.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Roberts & Rogers
52863,US,"Voluptuous, with a buttercreamy texture housing ripe fruit flavors of pineapples, Meyer lemon pie filling, ripe kiwis and pears, enriched with the caramel, custard and smoke of new oak and lees.

52864,Argentina,"From vines planted in 1955, this is a rose-tinted Pinot with a woven, integrated bouquet of toast, mineral and berry fruits. There's more Burgundian character here than New World, so it pours on the cerebral scents and flavors of tea, rose hip, strawberry and raspberry. Reserved in style, but good to drink now and over the next few years. If $100 seems like a lot to spend on Argentinean Pinot, you should try to give this a taste at some point; you may be convinced otherwise.",No. 55,93,100.0,Other,Río Negro Valley,,Pinot Noir,Bodega Chacra
52865,Chile,"Arguably the best Domus to date. This wine is super-complete and remarkably individual. It has that classic Macul-area aromas of black olive and tobacco, but the fruit from this great vintage is elevated and pure. Look for graphite, tar, cassis, cherry and chocolate all rolled into one fine, ageable package. It's Cabernet from Chile in all its glory. Drink now through 2014.",,93,55.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Domus Aurea
52866,US,"Bring this one down to the cellar and don't touch it for a good six years. It's a big, powerfully tannic wine, old-fashioned in its way, which is definitely not your modern cult style. With its flood of blackberries, black cherries, cassis, anise and cedar, it should purr away beautifully for many years.",Endeavour,93,55.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dry Creek Vineyard
52867,US,"Marked by rich acids and tannins, this is a youthful Pinot that needs brief time in the cellar, or decanting, to let it soften and mellow. The tightness doesn't prevent the massive cherry, black raspberry, vanilla, cola and Asian spice flavors from shining through. Give this high quality wine until the summer of 2009.",McDougall Vineyard,93,55.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield
52868,US,"Stillwater and Conner Lee vineyard grapes go into this fresh and spicy Chardonnay, detailed with herb and spice and cucumber flavors.

The spicy notes extend beautifully; though known primarily as a red wine producer, Mark Ryan has an especially good feel for white wines.",,93,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Mark Ryan
52869,France,"An impressive wine, with its tense structure, its ripe pear and melon flavors and its layers of richness. The smooth wood shows slowly and gently as it underlies the fruit flavors. There is also power here, and a definite ability to age.",Les Clos Grand Cru,93,78.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils
52870,France,"It seems at first taste very rounded, very soft. It is only after a moment that the full balance between acidity, green plums and rounded vanilla comes together.

52871,France,"A wine that shows the superlative quality of white Burgundy in 2006, this is big, powerful and yet finely restrained.

52872,US,"Younger and more raw than the 2004 Reserve, this spent 30 months in barrel. The fruit is similar to the '04, with ripe plum, prune and cherry liqueur. The edges are not quite as smooth as '04, there is a slight impression of alcohol and a hint of roughness in the tannins. But overall this is a fine companion to the '04, with a finish that brings in earth flavors of soil, compost and forest floor.",Reserve,93,60.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Sheridan Vineyard
52873,Austria,"Probably Salomon's star wine, this rich, concentrated Riesling brings together ripe white fruits, evocative honeysuckle perfume and a luxurious, creamy texture.

52875,US,"Famed winemaker Cathy Corison brings her restrained touch to this Cabernet for Lookout Ridge's guest winemaker series, which benefits charity. It's a dry, tannic wine that's a little too young to drink now. But it's classically proportioned, with lush currant and cedar flavors. Made from Corison's Kronos Vineyard, it will be best after 2011.",Cathy Corison,93,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lookout Ridge
52876,New Zealand,"Slightly bigger than the Block 3, but simultaneously softer as well, Felton Road's 2007 Block 5 features ripe, plummy fruit backed by earthy nuances, spice and cola.

52877,France,"Still young, this is a wine that needs to open and ripen. But already there are signs of richness, a wood- and tropical fruit-flavored wine that is typical of the full character of a Corton Charlemagne. It would be worth keeping 2–3 years for the wood to soften, the fruit to round out.",,93,189.0,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne,,Chardonnay,Bertrand Ambroise
52878,France,"As a Corton-Charlemagne should be, this is big and opulent. The minerality is quite present, a fresh addition to a wine that has more to do with ripe, racy tropical and yellow fruits that fill the mouth. It is not a wine for aging, maybe 2–3 years, but is certainly delicious now.",Domaine du Pavillon,93,,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne,,Chardonnay,Albert Bichot
52879,France,"Round, soft, with the fruit dominating its mineral character, this wine shows richness, but doesn't have huge aging ability.

52881,France,"A wine that is pure green and steel, only just hinting at wood. It has a very direct taste profile of taut green fruits, layers of acidity, just spiced up with toast and vanilla. It's obviously young, and should definitely be aged for 2–3 years.",Montmains Premier Cru,93,45.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,William Fèvre

52883,US,"This is a New World, cult-style Cab whose high alcohol creates an impression of sweetness, but not of heat.

52884,US,"This bottling from Lost Canyon is one of California's best-kept Syrah secrets. Year after year, it's a rich, tannic, dramatically structured wine of impressive depth and deliciousness. Packed with dry berry, cherry, leather, mocha and toasty oak flavors, it's beautiful now, with decanting, and should hold and even improve for up to six years.",Trenton Station Vineyard,93,38.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Lost Canyon
52885,US,"This bottling is now past its initial blush of youth and is entering its middle period. The cherry and pomegranate fruit is drying, turning more interesting and complex, with spicy, mushroomy complexities. Even the color is changing toward rust.

52886,US,"A beautiful Pinot Noir notable for sheer lusciousness, which is partly due to high alcohol.

Great now and for a decade.",Great Oak Vineyard,93,38.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
52887,US,"This bottling has turned out to be one of California's more important Merlot releases. The '05, like its immediate predecessors, is a dry, richly tannic wine of great elegance and structural complexity. It pleases now for the wealth of black currants, anise, herbs, spices and smoky oak, and should develop bottle nuances through 2011.",Reserve Mailbox Vineyard,93,60.0,California,Napa,,Merlot,Keenan
52888,France,"Perfumed white flower aromas lead into a wine that is dense and ripe. As the palate opens up, white and yellow fruits, cinnamon and buttered toast all work their ways into a wine that is almost a meal in itself. Still young, of course, already fresh, it will surely deepen and broaden as it ages. Screwcap.",Les Blanchots Grand Cru,93,87.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Domaine Laroche
52889,US,"Concentrated with a mix of toasted almonds, pineapple and candied peach fruit flavors; a thoroughly delicious and deeply seductive wine.

52890,US,"A home run. Given extra bottle age, this is drinking optimally at the moment, with a spicy, brambly nose mixing blackberries, mint and chocolate-covered cherries. There's a scent of fresh cut wood also, and a mouthful of fruit and barrel flavors that are both nicely integrated and complementary. The long finish lingers into a resonant note of black tea.",Cali's Cuvée,91,24.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Left Coast Cellars

52898,US,"Like it says, this Riesling is bone dry. It's also crisp in acidity, with a tang of minerals and steel.

52900,US,"Trisaetum is making some of the most exciting Rieslings in Oregon; now it can add Pinot Noir to its hit list. Estate grown, elegant and showing more than a little new French oak, this toasty wine drinks like a young Chambolle-Musigny.

52901,US,"This is a truly appealing wine that seduces with chocolate-covered cherry flavors and soft, inviting tannins. The balance and concentration are all in proportion, with no reliance on too much new oak (just 25% first use) for the flavor.

It's racy and almost delicate, with none of the jammy fruit of California or the funk of Washington.

It's all elegantly displayed, lingering and polished, with surprising length.",Estate,91,30.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Southern Oregon,Syrah,Abacela
52909,Italy,"This is a lovely and sophisticated expression of Petit Verdot from Sicily with elegant graphite and mineral tones that back plum, prune, spice and loads of toasted nut.

52918,US,"This is the reserve, a barrel selection limited to just 100 cases. The selection was done well and is meaningful; this has more grip and body than the excellent Estate 777 Pinot Noir that precedes it in price. A mix of Northwest berries define the fruit, set against moderately stiff tannins with suggestions of caramel from the oak aging.

53103,Italy,"Barolo Badarina is a soft, velvety wine with loads of spice, vanilla and clove. Those pleasurable aromas are woven between lively notes of fresh fruit and crushed mineral. The wine is supple, rich and opulent on the close. Cellar it five years or more.",Badarina,93,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Grimaldi Bruna
53104,US,"For years, Foxen has been producing one of the best Chenin Blancs in California, and with this 2009, they have outdone themselves. It's so rich in orange, honeydew and pineapple flavors, it might almost be Chardonnay, except it's drier and more minerally, and there's a wonderful note of dried herbs. Although production was only 575 cases, this wine is worth a special search, especially for sommeliers.",Ernesto Wickenden Vineyard Old Vines,93,22.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chenin Blanc,Foxen
53105,Italy,"Francesco Sobrero is an up and coming wine star in the Italian media. Indeed, this is a fascinating wine that offers a unique glimpse into Barolo typicity. This is a wine with a holistic approach: the spice and fruit notes are well integrated and the wine offers aged aromas of earth, leather and root beer. It's definitely worth a peek.",Ciabot Tanasio,93,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Francesco Sobrero
53106,Italy,"Cascina Adelaide always stands out in a crowd of Barolos thanks to the overall intensity of its Nebbiolo characteristics. Thanks to careful winemaking techniques, Preda takes that extra step: the fruit is brighter here and the spice notes are noticeably more piquant. You'll also taste fine mineral notes, violets and green olive.",Preda,93,88.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Cascina Adelaide
53107,France,"A Pinot Noir-dominated Champagne from 70-year-old vines, this is gorgeous, rich and concentrated. It has certainly benefitted from its aging before release. With a small production of 11,000 bottles, this is both serious and impressive.",Les Echansons Brut,93,90.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Mailly Grand Cru
53108,Italy,"This is a lovely, layered wine with unusual (but seductive) aromas of cassis, wild berry, violet, chopped mint, pine nut, iron, clove and savory black pepper. The finish is tight and dusty with finely textured tannins that fade after a long while. Drink after 2015.",Brunate,93,60.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Marcarini
53109,Italy,"This is a loaded wine, ripe with aromas of cherry cola, chopped herbs, white chocolate, blackberry and cassis. The aromatic presentation is never overpowering and the wine is in fact delicate and elegant with finely tuned finesse. Pair this Barolo with truffle-stuffed veal roast.",Brunate,93,60.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Mario Marengo
53110,Austria,". Christoph Neumeister's top wine, this is a classic among Sauvignon Blancs. It is tightly structured, very herbal, with greengage and gooseberry flavors over asparagus and spice. It can age well, needing 3–4 years to reach its peak.",Moarfeitl,93,48.0,Südoststeiermark,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Neumeister
53111,Italy,"Oak aging (with 25% new French barrel) has helped shape sweet aromas of vanilla and exotic spice backed by loads of cherry and ripe forest berry. Characteristic aromas of violets, wet earth and graphite appear at the back and the wine is firm, thick and smooth on the close. Consider long cellar aging: 10 years or more.",Cottá,93,55.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Sottimano
53112,Italy,"Ugo Lequio offers one of the best expressions of Nebbiolo from the Gallina cru. His beautiful Barbaresco from Neive delivers impressive extraction and aromatic intensity.

The mouthfeel is smooth, elegant and the finish is long.",Gallina,93,,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Ugo Lequio
53113,Italy,"This special cru selection Barbaresco offers enormous intensity and persistency of flavor. This is a supremely elegant wine with ethereal aromas of cassis, tar, licorice and root beer. There's tannic structure and a fine texture here and the wine should age well for many more years.",Camp Gros Martinenga,93,85.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Tenute Cisa Asinari dei Marchesi di Gresy
53114,Italy,"Barolo Colonnello is a determined, confident wine with a rich, succulent style and ripe aromas of blackberry, spice, sweet vanilla and polished black stone.

53115,Italy,"The Preda Sarmassa Barolo Riserva offers an interesting and immediate bouquet of cola, currants, dried mint, green olive and capers. This is a distinctive and special wine that would pair wonderfully against a meat dish with an herbal element. Try it with beef and mint jelly or herb-encrusted lamb chops.",Preda Sarmassa Riserva,93,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Virna Borgogno
53116,Italy,"Barolo Case Nere from La Morra opens with extremely dark and concentrated extraction followed by young oak-related aromas of spice, leather and tobacco. But, thanks to the bright fruit notes at the back—blueberry, cassis and pomegranate—those toasted notes will fade further into the background as the wine evolves in time.",Case Nere,93,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Enzo Boglietti
53117,Italy,"Sassy spice and piquant touches of furniture wax, root beer, wild berries, licorice and white truffle open the nose of this vineyard-designate Barolo. In general, the spice aromas stand out most and the wine is squeaky-polished in the mouth. Drink after 2015.",Vigna Mandorlo,93,75.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Giacosa Fratelli
53118,Italy,"This is a lovely wine with a generous disposition and intense aromas of forest fruit, nutmeg, clove, anise seed and licorice.

Pair this wine with thin slices of grilled steak topped with porcini mushrooms.",,93,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Gianfranco Alessandria
53119,Italy,"Gianni Gagliardo's Barolo Serre is an impressively delicate wine with layers of wild berry, red rose, pressed violets, smoke and mineral.

This classic expression of Nebbiolo shows the best qualities of this noble Italian variety.",Serre,93,75.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Gianni Gagliardo
53120,France,"A soft and beautifully ripe Champagne, albeit with a steely, mineral core. It is very much in the Gosset pure, dry style, full of apple and grapefruit acidity to go with a light yeast character. Unlike some 2000s, this should age well.",Grand Millésime Brut,93,90.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Gosset
53121,Italy,"This is a lovely Barolo with oak-driven aromas of vanilla and sweet spice between delicate layers of rose, tar and wild berry. There's plenty of tasty pulp and substance backed by tight tannins that will undoubtedly relax with more time in the bottle. Cellar age this wine five to ten more years.",Ciabot Berton,93,80.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Ciabot Berton
53122,Chile,"Deep, a bit reduced on the nose, and full as can be, with blackberry, cassis and prune aromas. The palate is super rich and concentrated, and frankly a bit heady. Flavors of burnt brown sugar, toast, tobacco, pepper and baked berry fruits are delicious, and the finish is dense and long. Drinkable now but best in another two to four years. This marks the 20th anniversary of Concha y Toro's Don Melchor Cabernet.",Don Melchor,93,95.0,Puente Alto,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Concha y Toro
53123,US,"The best of Belle Glos's 2008 Pinots. It's notable for the extreme richness of the raspberries and cherries, which have a jammy intensity with even more succulent notes of vanilla cream and smoky butter. But the finish is dry, while acidity and tannins bring the wine to earth. Delicious now and through 2014.",Taylor Lane Vineyard,93,44.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Belle Glos
53124,US,"There's something very fine and compelling about this Merlot-based Bordeaux blend. It's powerful in oak-inspired blackberry, black cherry and black currant flavors, but even more noteworthy is the quality of the tannin structure, which is firm and classic. Just feels rich and dramatic, with great weight and density. Give it a few years in the cellar to mellow, and it should develop for a decade or more.",Proprietary Red Wine,93,86.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Alpha Omega
53125,Italy,"Thanks to its plush and velvety nature, this is a wine with universal appeal. Barolo Bricco Sarmassa opens in big fashion with aromas of black cherry, Indian   spice, vanilla and dark espresso bean. It's tight and tannic in the mouth but, fundamentally, the wine's saving grace is that it's never too extracted or overblown.",Bricco Sarmassa,93,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Brezza

It is ripe, generous, to be drunk with food.",Special Cuvée Brut,93,65.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Bollinger
53127,US,"Dark, bold, potent and young are just a few words to describe this Cabernet, which contains a splash of Petit Verdot and Malbec. Shows concentrated blackberry, black currant and violet flavors that turn sweet and chocolaty on the finish, although the wine itself is perfectly dry. Quite tannic, which suggests ageability, although high alcohol of 15.5% will be controversial in some circles. Best after 2013, in a proper cellar.",Georges de Latour Private Reserve,93,115.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beaulieu Vineyard
53128,Italy,"Boroli is a young and dynamic winery to watch. This Barolo from the gorgeous Cerequio cru is ripe with traditional aromas of wild berry, leather, soft spice and white truffle. Extra character is added by slightly oddball aromas of carrot and smoked ham that work overall to the wine's favor. Drink after 2015.",Cerequio,93,80.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Boroli
53129,Italy,"The beautiful Brunate cru is known for heavier, darker expressions of Nebbiolo and this wine does a wonderful job of showing off its territorial traits.

It's balanced and firm and will surely evolve favorably over the next decade.",Brunate,93,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Damilano

53142,US,"Long past its January 2008 release, this dark, chewy, tannic Merlot is still tough and unyielding.

53161,US,"The Savoy Vineyard is one of the best in Anderson Valley. In capable hands like Roessler's, it yields classic California coastal Pinot Noir.

53165,US,"At two-plus years this Pinot Noir still is an infant. It's a swirl of new toasty oak, ripe cherries and currants, acidity and fresh, chunky tannins. It's a pity that much of it will be opened too young.

It's almost exactly half and half Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, and smells like beautifully ripe blackberries, boysenberries and cassis.

53186,US,"It's lush, leesy and rich, and broadcasts a flavorful mix of grapefruit, orange peel, Meyer lemon, hints of pineapple, Key lime pie and peach, all in a very creamy style. The wine is graceful and smooth, the fruit detailed with hints of toasted almond and cracker.",,92,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Viognier,Mark Ryan
53187,US,"Tasted in December, this Pinot was going through an awkward phase. It's like the cherry and currant fruit, new oak, acids and tannins are groping for each other in a dark room. Need time to show its complexity, and should begin to resolve well into 2009.",Great Oak Vineyard,92,38.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
53188,France,"Made from 70-year-old vines planted by Christian Moreau's father, Guy, this wine shows extra concentration, certainly, but also the pure pleasure of ripe, delicious Chardonnay. It's initially tight, but the rich green fruits and toast soon come forward to give an impressively big wine, and one worth aging.",Cuvée Guy Moreau Vaillon Premier Cru,92,48.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils
53189,Italy,"Sole dei Padri is a soft, opulent and elegant wine that would taste great with a sophisticated dinner of red meat and wild mushrooms. Aromas include black cherries, spice, smoked ham and white pepper.",Sole dei Padri,92,55.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Syrah,Principi di Spadafora
53190,US,"Shows true cool-climate varietal character in the aromas and flavors of cherries, cola, pomegranates and rhubarb pie, with complicating notes from charred oak barrels.

53191,Germany,"A pale, lemon color Riesling. The complex nose of honey, delicate stone fruit, elder-flower and stony minerality is deliciously inviting, while intense, focused ripe fruit prevails all across the palate. This is sweet, yet crisp and oozing freshness, with a taut, lively texture. Very long, complex and subtle at the same time.",Wehlener Sonnenuhr Auslese,91,42.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Dr. Loosen
53192,US,"A rich, woody style of Pinot Blanc, the barrel toast wrapped around superripe tropical fruit flavors of banana, papaya and pineapple, with a hint of grapefruity acids. This is flat-out delicious, and could easily pass for an expensive Chardonnay.",Quail Run,91,22.0,Oregon,Southern Oregon,Southern Oregon,Pinot Blanc,Erath
53193,Argentina,"Oaky, creamy and a bit lactic on the nose, with an easy style to the palate and ripe, sweet flavors of blackberry and black cherry that are delicious but lack complexity. Finishes big, syrupy and sweet, with a spot of raisin. Really good for a blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Petit Verdot. Drink now through 2013.",Apartado,91,70.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Felipe Rutini
53194,Germany,"Medium gold in color. Attractive nose, quite citrussy, orange with floral notes and a touch of honey. Layered and reasonably complex.

Evident minerality right across the palate to the finish, which is persistent, layered and savory.",Dürkheimer Spielberg Spätlese Trocken,91,24.0,Pfalz,,,Chardonnay,Fitz-Ritter
53195,US,"Once again, the Burgundian touch of Veronique Drouhin has crafted a wine of surpassing elegance and immaculate structure. This is the antithesis of a jammy, California style yet it retains much of the vibrancy of New World fruit rather than the suppressed rusticity of Burgundy. Delicate cherry and tart plum fruit is sculpted into a wine with nuanced details of cola and coffee and spice.",,91,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Domaine Drouhin Oregon
53196,US,"Made in an exceptionally ripe and strongly oaky way, this wine is rather heavy right now. The Cabernet was blended with some Syrah and Petit Verdot grown in a Calistoga vineyard. There's no questioning the richness, but it's so ripe that the blackberries veer into dark chocolate and prunes. See what it does over the next eight years.",,91,95.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Coup de Foudre
53197,Italy,"Here's an inky dark and impenetrable blend of Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc, Merlot and Marzemino.

53199,US,"With massive fruit and power, this low production (300 case) Zinfandel will make lovers of the Shelton style exult, while others might find it lacking elegance.

53200,US,"California Syrah doesn't get much richer than this. It explodes in blackberry and cherry jam, olive tapenade, dark chocolate and bacon flavors, wrapped into firm, intricate tannins. Lacks some vital acidity for balance, and so it doesn't seem ageable, but a fancy wine for drinking now.",Mr. Smith,91,56.0,California,California,California Other,Syrah,Piedrasassi
53201,US,"This Cabernet-based blend of all five Bordeaux varieties is the most inaccessible of Merryvale's '07 portfolio, and it consequently offers the least pleasure now. It's quite rich in blackberries and currants but the tannins are considerable, and 90% new oak buries the fruit under a cloak of char and wood tannins. Feels rustic, but obviously pedigreed and extremely ageable. The score could soar over the next 6–9 years as the wine develops in the bottle.",Profile,91,150.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Merryvale
53202,Italy,"Opens with a rich, saturated appearance, impressive complexity and intense aromas of ripe fruit and spice.

53205,US,"Marked by zesty acidity and dryness, this Chard shows long hangtime, ripe flavors of pineapples, lemons and sweet green apples.

53208,US,"This estate-bottled Pinot Gris, from a vineyard planted in 1983, shows some definite residual sugar, despite its alcohol rating of 14.4%. Plenty ripe all right, and plenty tasty, too. This has the body and balance to match up with a fat cut of salmon, perhaps in a semisweet tamari sauce, or a grilled pork roast with a fruit dressing.",,90,16.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Southern Oregon,Pinot Gris,Anindor

53210,Germany,"Pale lemony color. Some initial reductive notes blow off to reveal a classic Mosel nose of delicate flowers, white stone fruit and slate.

53214,US,"This gentle, lightly off-dry Riesling was fermented primarily in neutral oak, which seems to have softened the entry without impacting the flavors.

53267,US,"This is a great price for a single-vineyard Syrah from the Napa Valley region of Yountville. The wine is bone dry, acidic and tannic, with deep, impressive blackberry, black currant, green tea, charred meat and black pepper flavors. It improves a lot with decanting, and overall is impressive.",Massa Ranch,91,18.0,California,Yountville,Napa,Syrah,People's Wine Revolution
53268,Spain,"Ripe blackberry and cassis aromas are pure and lusty. In the mouth, it shows chewy tannins, a stout structure and generous flavors of blackberry, chocolate, pepper and a spot of salty brine. A toasty, dark, heady finish confirms the overall quality. Drink through 2020.",Vendimia Seleccionada,91,30.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Viña Mayor
53269,France,"A perfumed, aromatic wine, dry yet full of fresh, fragrant white fruit flavors. A steely edge is followed by hints of currants and a complex, still-youthful texture. Drink from 2015.",Osterberg Grand Cru,91,38.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Cave de Ribeauvillé
53270,France,"Complex and rich, it has ripe red fruits that are full of sweetness as well as some fresher acidity. With red plum, minerality and vanilla, it can age for a few months. Wait until 2015.",La Chapelle Gordonne,91,25.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,,Rosé,Château la Gordonne
53271,France,"The wine feels rich, dense and packed with ripe fruitiness. Delicious, refreshing acidity gives these red fruits a lift and crispness. This is a serious wine, demanding food.",Le Cloître de Sainte Roseline,91,25.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,,Rosé,Château Sainte Roseline
53272,France,"This benchmark rosé is round yet fresh, and crisp while ripely fruity. Red berry fruits are finely textured and attractive acidity cuts through the full body of the wine. It would be worth aging until late 2014.",La Source,91,21.0,Provence,Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence,,Rosé,Château Vignelaure
53273,US,"Dry, crisp and silky, it shows complex raspberry jam, buttered cinnamon toast and sandalwood flavors. It provides great satisfaction, at a fair price.",,91,32.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dichotomy
53274,New Zealand,"With only 56 cases imported, this may be one of the hardest Saint Clair wines to find, but it offers a refreshingly austere alternative to some of the winery's other bottlings. It's only medium bodied, with delicate, leafy aromas and pristine white-grapefruit flavors. Convincingly dry and bracing on the finish, it would make a brisk counterpoint to rich fish dishes.",Pioneer Block 24 Arthur,91,27.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Saint Clair
53275,US,"Smooth and palate-coating, it's 100% varietal, with just the right balance between blackberry and black cherry fruit, and barrel-induced flavors of toffee, toasted macadamia nuts, and café crème.",,91,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Seven Hills
53276,US,"Impressive in its size and weight, this wine has tart fruit flavors of pomegranate and blueberry, with a dusting of coffee grounds. Tannins are ripe, firm and sleek, and the structure impactful. This needs even more bottle age or some hours of aeration.",Estate Grown,91,30.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sangiovese,Tranche
53277,US,"This shows the lovely balance of both the winery and the appellation, with a silky, lightly tannic mouthfeel brightened by plenty of acidity. The flavors are delicate and complex, suggesting wild raspberries, thyme, cranberries and toast. No reason to age this puppy, so drink now–2016.",,91,52.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
53278,Israel,"Inky violet-red in color, this wine has aromas of raspberry, black cherry, vanilla and mixed baking spices. Flavors of black cherry, raspberry, coffee and toffee are equally bright on entry and at the finish, with a nice mellow period in the middle. The silky finish is marked by a vivid salted toffee splash.",Namura Single Vineyard Special Reserve,91,,Galilee,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Or Haganuz
53279,US,"Perfumed and elegant, this wine is a highlight within the producer's line up of consistently well-made wines. Waxy honeycomb and floral aromas accent fresh green notes on this off-dry Riesling. It's lean in style, yet plush with sweet white peach and melon flavors. Finishes long with a lingering spray of honeysuckle.",Tango Oaks Vineyard,91,20.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Red Newt Cellars
53280,US,"A pretty, lightweight Pinot, showing the variety's silky texture and cherry flavors, but it thins out on the finish.",,84,12.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Castle Rock
53281,Argentina,"A little sweet on the nose, but also fairly scattered and unfocused. The feel is nice and the bubble bead is right on. But the flavors are centered around dull apple, and there seems to be a salinic element that makes everything taste a little salty.",Extra Brut,84,12.0,Other,Argentina,,Sparkling Blend,Cave Extrême
53282,US,"A little sweet and direct in berry-flavored pie-filling, this Petite Sirah shows the variety's full-bodied texture and firm tannins. Brings to mind pizza, with sweet melted cheese.",,84,25.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Petite Sirah,Christian Lazo
53283,US,"With high alcohol, this blend of Zinfandel and Syrah has a hot, peppery mouthfeel. The flavors are of slightly burnt, pie-filling blackberries and cherries.",Gemini Reserve,84,39.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Red Blend,Midnight

53286,Argentina,"An interesting wine that walks to the beat of its own drum. Organic wines are almost always a little unusual, and this is no different. It pours on the funky red-fruit aromas and then come herbal cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. As a whole it's a good, well-made wine with decent feel. But hailing from La Rioja, it also has its own unfamiliar identity. Worth a try if organic wines are your thing.",Organic,84,10.0,Other,Famatina Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pircas Negras
53287,Chile,"Hints of melon and talcum powder suggest sweetness, and the palate is ripe, a little soft and dominated by pear and even some lychee flavors. Maybe there's a hint of residual sugar, but if so, it's minor. Mild bitterness doesn't really help the finish, but overall this is a flavorful and competent value wine.",,84,7.0,Curicó Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Quasar
53288,Chile,"Hickory and other resiny aromas dominate the nose, and oak is the major player from start to finish. If you like a thick Chardonnay weighted down with cinnamon, resin and extract, then this is it. But to us it's overoaked and borderline cloying. It just doesn't have that natural fresh-fruit touch; seems overmanipulated. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.",Reserva de Familia,84,15.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Santa Carolina

53290,US,"If you are a fan of Rosenblum Zins, you might want to try this Washington Zin, styled in the same 16.4% alcohol mode. It's got plenty of syrupy berry fruit, and some very chocolaty streaks as well, but the tannins are earthy and still have a bitter finish to them. The winery's regular Zin is far better.",Proprietor's Reserve,84,38.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Zinfandel,Maryhill
53291,US,"Made in a very exaggerated, exotic style, this Viognier is almost dessert-wine sweet. It has flamboyant tropical fruit, crême brulée and caramel flavors, and is soft in texture, like a cream puff.",,84,20.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Novy

53293,US,"Smoky, sweet oak overwhelms the underlying wine, giving a caramelized sweetness to the basic black currant flavors. Doesn't seem like an ager.",H Block,84,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Falcor
53294,US,"Oddly, the Genesis bottling seems flatter, duller and overall less focused than the winery's excellent Columbia Valley Chardonnay. It just doesn't hold together in the middle, and fades quickly into some cardboardy notes.",Genesis,84,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Hogue
53295,US,"Made of the two Cabs plus Petite Sirah, this red is soft, sweet and simple. It has jammy blackberry and cherry flavors with a rich finish of milk chocolate and mint.",Cuvée Béla,84,20.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Red Blend,Kokomo
53296,Argentina,"Fiery and crisp, with decent berry and cherry aromas giving it character. The palate is medium to racy, with zesty raspberry, cherry and rhubarb flavors. Finishes short and a little prickly, with heat and a hint of chocolate. Very basic, but by no means a bad wine.",,84,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tercos
53297,US,"It's bit harsh in texture and is minty, with wintergreen and pepper flavors that nudge into cherries and mocha. Good for barbecue and cheese plates.",Esola Vineyad,84,20.0,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Amador Foothill Winery
53298,Argentina,"There's more rhubarb and bramble here than we prefer from a young, everyday Malbec, and thus the bouquet is austere and only skin deep. As might be expected given the aromas, the palate is limited to herbal, lightly pickled red fruit, while the finish is quick and offers some lasting chocolate. Decent wine, but that's as far as it goes.",Premium,84,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alta Vista
53299,US,"Simple, soft and jammy, with baked cherry pie, currant and milk chocolate flavors. There's a bitterness throughout. Drink now.",Bon Vivant,84,35.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hunt Cellars
53300,France,"This wine has distinct acidity, probably too much. Red currant fruits dominate, giving the wine elegance, but also showing some unripe fruit flavors and a texture that is too light and unfocused.",Les Champs Pimont Premier Cru,84,,Burgundy,Beaune,,Pinot Noir,Maison Champy
53301,US,"This is a Bordeaux blend with some Sangiovese and Syrah. It's a little rustic and everyday—with dry tannins framing extracted currant, beef jerky and cola flavors—and tends toward overripeness. Drink now.",Red Rex,84,25.0,California,North Coast,North Coast,Red Blend,Deerfield Ranch
53302,US,"Soft and melted, this Cab has pastry-filling flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and anise. It's a bit on the sweet side, and could use greater tannin and acid structure.",Del Lago,84,32.0,California,Clear Lake,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ceago Vinegarden
53303,US,"Soft and easy, with very ripe blackberry and currant flavors that veer into chocolate-covered raisins. Finishes a bit hot, but dry.",,84,28.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Christian Lazo
53304,US,"Conn Creek has stumbled a bit in recent years, and this Cab is evidence. The wine is dry and richly tannic, but sharp, overripe and hot, with jammy currant flavors that veer into raisins.",Collins Vineyard,84,45.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Conn Creek
53305,Chile,"Slightly funky and pickled, but also dusty and endowed with raspberry and plum aromas. The palate rests on tangy rhubarb and nectarine, while the bouncy mouthfeel has spritz and kick. If not for the pickled rhubarb character, it would be more strongly recommended.",Rosado Soul,84,12.0,Maipo Valley,,,Rosé,Santa Ema
53306,Argentina,"Aromas of baked corn and citrus lead to a sharp, tangy palate that offers lemon and other citrus flavors, but not much heft or sweet fruit to balance things off. Thus it's a razor-sharp and edgy bubbly with lemony sourness all the way through the finish.",Premium Extra Brut,83,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Alta Vista

53308,Argentina,"Can't say that sparkling wines and whites are Toso's strong suit. This Pinot Noir-based wine is tan in color and smells and tastes a lot like carbonated Sherry. Flavors of dull citrus and nuts work the palate, while the finish is controlled but not all that lively.",Extra Toso Extra Brut Reserve Sparkling,83,,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Pinot Noir,Pascual Toso
53309,US,"A bit too soft and candy sweet, this Sauvignon Blanc has forward flavors of pineapples and spearmint. The oaky overlay weighs it down with caramel and vanilla.",Estate,83,18.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Peju
53310,Italy,Col di Sas is a simple and crisp Prosecco with floral aromas stacked over fruity tones of peach and citrus.

53311,Chile,"This is a crisp, spicy, fully oaked Pinot with raspberry, herb and toast aromas. Racy and zesty on the palate, and full of zingy, red-tilting pie cherry, plum and raspberry flavors. Turns oakier and toastier late, with caramel balanced by residual acidity on the finish.",Reserva,87,16.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Pinot Noir,TerraNoble
53312,US,"Rich, ripe blackberry preserves, vanilla and toasted coconut flavors make this full bodied Cab Franc feel deliciously warm and generous in style.

53318,Italy,Cartizze is a tiny swath of vertical vineyard at the heart of Valdobbiadene that is said to make the best Prosecco.

53319,US,"Imagery has a good track record with Petite Sirah, and this '08 is right up there.

53320,US,"This vintage's blend is 50% Syrah, 25% Cinsault and smaller percentages of other varieties. It's an oaky, cedar-tinged, gamy red that's big in the mouth, dense and tannic with Michael David's smoky signature.",,87,18.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Red Blend,Incognito

53328,US,"Good and easy to like, but too oaky by half, with smoky char flavors dominating. Underneath that is a crisply dry, minerally Chardonnay, with fine orange and Meyer lemon flavors.

53363,Spain,"Aromas of barrel spice and grilled pineapple are solid, while the palate is thick and creamy with orange marmalade and banana flavors.

And the finish evaporates fast, leaving heat and medicinal notes.",Proyecto Cu4ro,84,12.0,Catalonia,Catalunya,,Red Blend,Bodegas Concavins
53367,Spain,"Minty smelling, with herbal red fruit and rhubarb scents. The wine is clack, clack, clack on the palate as acids and snappy red fruit draw everything down to the base level.

53455,South Africa,"“The Affair” refers to the relationship between the French and Italian varieties in the blend.

53463,New Zealand,"With only 56 cases imported, this may be one of the hardest Saint Clair wines to find, but it offers a refreshingly austere alternative to some of the winery's other bottlings. It's only medium bodied, with delicate, leafy aromas and pristine white-grapefruit flavors.

53488,France,"This ripe wine has jammy red fruit flavors. The fruitiness is given structure by the stalky tannins and the dry, wood-aging flavors.

53492,US,"This is a wine that requires concentration to appreciate. Tasted blind, it's hard and impenetrable. When you understand its origins, it becomes clearer, a mountain wine of strong, shut-down tannins, but with a core of black currants.

53501,US,"Ironstone's aim with this Bordeaux blend seems clear, to produce an ageworthy wine of distinction. They have largely succeeded, although it's a very different style than you'll find from anything on the coast. It shows the briary, brambly tannins and tastes usually associated with Foothills Zinfandel, but the black currant and cherry flavors belong to Cabernet Sauvignon, which constitutes 80% of the blend.

53503,US,"This Loess is definitely more—more concentration, more ripeness, more Côte Rôtie character than the 2005, but already showing dramatic flavor development. Cofermented with 3% Viognier, it's a silky wine with flavors of blood, meat and earth dominating. Tannins are ripe, and it was barreled in second-fill oak, preserving the natural flavors of the vineyard. Clearly the best so far from Waters.",Loess Vineyard,92,40.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Waters
53504,US,"This is 100% new oak (primarily Taransaud, 32 months), and it's a marvelous example of the grape, the vineyard and the strengths of Washington fruit. The Shafer Hillside Select is the inspiration for the extended barrel aging and the focus on round, sweet tannins. This is a tight wine, with a lovely purity of fruit that captures the cassis, the black cherry, the subtle herbal character of the Cabernet grape.

53505,US,"Impresses for its depth, power and balance, a wine whose classic acid-tannin structure could only have come from a pedigreed terroir.

It's drily tannic, but enormously rich in currants, with complexities of smoky leather, tobacco, olive tapenade and tamari-sauteed wild mushrooms. Delicious now, and should develop bottle complexities through 2012.",Cuvee Kilene Brosseau Vineyard,92,38.0,California,Chalone,Central Coast,Syrah,Brosseau
53509,US,"Very rich, very complicated, a young, dense, grapey wine that clearly needs time to come around. Dry and balanced in acids and tannins, it shows brilliantly ripe blackberry, black cherry and cola flavors, with an earthy note the Brits used to call beetroot.

53516,US,"The vineyard is in the Santa Rita Hills, and the wine impresses with the classic structure of this fine coastal appellation.

53574,Spain,"One taste and you can see the correlation between this Priorat dry PX and certain fino-style Sherries. It's nutty and dry as a bone, with almondy aromas.

53593,Argentina,"Few wineries in Argentina make more individual wines than Achaval-Ferrer. And while some are great, others leave you scratching your head or wanting something different. This one has a deep hue but a strange mix of herbal, floral aromas that hint at air freshener. The palate is quite acid-driven and downright sharp, with pounding blueberry and kirsch flavors. More austere and tangy than we prefer.",,83,29.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Achaval-Ferrer

53598,Argentina,"Las Moras is from Argentina's La Rioja region, and Black Label aims to be its top product. But mostly the wine pushes minty, dark oak on top of superficial plum and berry fruit.

53724,US,"One of the driest Viogniers in California, and also one of the most elegant. Doesn't explode with exotic richness the way some Viogniers do, but it's a very fine white wine, noble and minerally, with nuances of tropical and citrus fruits. Really opens up a whole new direction for Viognier.",,92,30.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Viognier,Jorian Hill

53726,Italy,"Here's an evolved and sophisticated Barolo Riserva with savory aromas of crushed black pepper, balsam, humus, old spice, licorice and root beer.

53727,France,"Just approaching toasty maturity, this is a rich and full wine, its white fruits and perfumes floating above yeast, cookie and pine nut flavors. It has a great mouthfeel, a tingling character, acidity and richness in harmony.",Brut Saphir 1.5 liters,92,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Louis Barthélémy
53728,France,"With a fine sense of maturity, this is rich, toasty, full-bodied and concentrated.

At the end, acidity combines with a fine toasty flourish.",Grande Réserve Grand Cru Brut,92,55.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Lallier
53729,US,"There's lots of new French oak on this Cabernet, but the underlying wine is powerful enough to take it. Shows rich, gentle tannins and fine acidity framing complex, flavorful cherry, blackberry and raspberry fruit.

53735,Australia,"A disappointing effort from this stalwart Clare Valley producer, but still a good wine, with pretty aromas of crushed stone, mint and lime.

53755,Australia,"In the heat of the 2008 vintage, it may have been a mistake to further dry 20% of the grapes for this wine.

53761,US,"A fine Otis Cab, from Columbia's now departed winemaking team of David Lake and Robert Takahashi. It's rich and deep, scented with a luscious mix of fresh herbs. The fruit has a pleasing spiciness, sweet plum and cassis threaded with anise and sage. There seems to be more fruit concentration and less of the green, peppery character that Otis can bring in some vintages, but even now this is a very young wine (it was released in June of 2008) that should reward another few years of cellaring.",Otis Vineyard,91,28.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Columbia Winery
53762,US,"In the blend are small portions of 6% Syrah, 3% Merlot and 1% Cabernet Franc—winemaker Mike Wade is a meticulous blender—and the nuanced character is immediately apparent.

53769,US,"This comes from a one-acre block of Dijon 75 clone Chardonnay; whole-cluster pressed and barrel fermented. Succulent is the word that keeps cropping up as it rollicks across the palate; it's juicy and loaded with a mix of apple, pear and light tropical fruit, especially pineapple.

53786,Chile,"The Carmenère in this Carm-Cabernet-Syrah blend is the lead singer, so expect a touch of minty green and herbal essence. It's a heavyweight in the sense that the mouthfeel is big and the tannins are a little hard.

Velvety and supple, this is a modulated mix of bright, sassy blackberry and currant fruit, spiced up with the peppery highlights of Syrah. The effect is to move it solidly into the Australian camp, which makes perfect sense, for nowhere else in the New World do these two grapes sync up so well.

53901,Argentina,"Neither overpowering nor impressive. In fact, this is a flat, underdeveloped Torrontés with aromas of air freshener and flavors of banana, papaya and sugared doughnuts.

53903,Argentina,"This is the first Torrontés from Pascual Toso that we've rated, and if it's any indication of what's going on there, then we say stick to the reds.

53904,Argentina,"The only thing that makes this a gran reserva is the label and the winery's commitment to a big, extracted, heavily oaked wine. It's black as ink but clumsy as can be.

53907,Spain,"Talk about a wine that makes you take notice. This is simply great modern Rioja. The nose is creamy but honest, with black fruit, mocha and finely tanned leather.

53908,US,"Marks a welcome return to the magnificence of the 2002, although more recent vintages haven't exactly been slouches. The '05 is amazing, a densely structured, deeply flavored Bordeaux blend that's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. Shows classic notes of cassis, currants and black cherry liqueur, while 70% new oak adds enticingly rich layers of sweet toast and smoky vanilla. The tannins are pure, classic Napa, very refined and ripe, offering solid structural support with no trace of astringency.

53998,Spain,"Rather baked and heavy, with chunky black fruit and chocolate on the nose. First in line on the palate is raisin and prune, while in back of that there's vanilla, dill and brown sugar. With grating tannins and excess weight, this one has balance issues while still offering some good looks at Ribera del Duero.

54000,Italy,"This intense and determined Nebbiolo from the Martinenga cru of Barbaresco delivers enticing aromas of black fruit, smoke, tar, licorice and old spice.

54001,US,"This has been Riverbench's best Pinot and it still is. Shows the wonderful ability to be deliciously drinkable now, yet with the stuffing for the cellar. Dry and crisp and full-bodied, it shows berry, currants, mushroom, grilled meat and sandalwood flavors, dusted with Indian spices. Now–2015.",Mesa,92,48.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Riverbench
54002,France,"With its high percentage of Champagne's third grape, Pinot Meunier, as a result of the growing conditions of 2003, this is a great wine that is developing fast. It has more toast, less fruit, although its richness and weight are finely in balance with a yeasty cookie dough character.",Grand Vintage Brut,92,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Moët & Chandon
54003,Italy,"Nebbiolo, the grape, and Nubiola, the designate name, stem from the same Italian word: nebbia, or “fog” that regularly blankets the Langhe. This bright Barbaresco is defined by a distinctive aroma of tar or freshly applied street asphalt that is typical of the variety. Additional aromas include back fruit, prune and plum. The mouthfeel is streamlined, tight and elegant.",Nubiola,92,38.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Pelissero
54004,Italy,"A relative newcomer, Massimo Rattalino makes an impressive debut with this tasty Barbaresco. The wine is beautifully tonic with vibrant tones of rose, pressed flower, wild berries, almond skin, cinnamon and new leather. Those bright aromas are surrounded by drying graphite nuances, bright acidity and polished tannins.",Quarantadue42,92,,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Rattalino
54005,US,"Classic Rutherford Cab. Dry, dusty and slightly herbal, with refined, jammy flavors of red and black cherries, currants, mocha and cedar.

54006,US,"Shows enormous complexity of flavor, a wine that really impresses for its myriad blackberry, cherry, currant, cola, grilled meat, sautéed mushroom, violet and chocolate flavors. If the structure were more firm, it would be a perfect wine. But this is Paso Robles, where the wines will always be soft. A blend of Syrah and Petite Sirah.",Syrée,92,39.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Syrah-Petite Sirah,Vina Robles

54009,US,"No winery in California has explored this French variety more than Cambiata, and with the '06, they've produced another interesting wine.

54010,US,"Although there's a lot of oak on this wine, it's not heavy or fat in the excessive California style, because the underlying wine is so crisp and elegant. Call it Chablisian.

54011,Italy,"Barolo Bricco delle Viole is a lush and generous wine with a bright ruby color and attractively intense aromas of cherry, wild berry, nutmeg, clove, powdered licorice and root beer. The oak influence is still obvious at this early stage, but will no doubt integrate with time. The mouthfeel is exceedingly soft, smooth and velvety.

54012,Italy,"Very different than the 2005 vintage, Barolo Le Coste from Giacomo Grimaldi opens with a brownish-amber color and ripe berry or candied fruit aromas.

54013,Italy,"There are some ripe notes here of black cherry and raspberry (2007 was a hot, dry vintage in Piedmont) but you'll also get territory-driven notes of wet earth and dried beef or bresaola. The mouthfeel is dry and firm thanks to the elegantly polished nature of the tannins.",Sorì Burdin,92,60.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Fontanabianca

54015,Italy,"Monsordo is an innovative concept and is a premier example of a modern, international wine with unmistakable roots in Piedmont. Fruit used here includes Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Nebbiolo and the overall effect it that of harmony and power. The wine is packed tight with red fruit, spice and tobacco and its texture is smooth, dense and rich. Very nice.",Monsordo,92,38.0,Piedmont,Langhe,,Red Blend,Ceretto
54016,Italy,"Here's a hefty, big expression of Nebbiolo with thick spice notes and touches of vanilla and cinnamon that sit over a core of bright fruit. The wine offers a soft quality of tannin, followed by tart freshness, resulting in a pleasurable sensation of richness and opulence on the palate.

54017,France,"Very young wine, one which is full and rich, but which needs several years to blossom into its full potential. It is in the dry Deutz style, emphasizing acidity and elegance, even though it also has a wonderful ripe intensity.",Rosé Brut,92,73.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Deutz
54018,Italy,"Here's a wine that begs a pairing with a truffle dish: black truffle Cornish hen or creamy risotto with white truffle flakes would do the trick.

This is a beautiful wine with a firm, determined but elegant finish.",Cannubi San Lorenzo,92,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Cavalier Bartolomeo
54019,Italy,"Neirane is a balanced Barolo with soft notes of cherry, black fruit and spice wrapped tight around a solid core of quality fruit.

54021,US,"The word inky must have been invented for this pure Cabernet Franc, sourced from the Weinbau vineyard (the label is misprinted). In the world of Cabernet Franc, many are called, and few are chosen. This is one of the chosen. Dense, tightly threaded with smoke, earth, black olive, black cherry, cassis and mocha scents and flavors, this nonetheless drinks smoothly. The tannin management is superb, softening up the hard edges without stripping the wine of flavor.",,92,29.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Franc,Nefarious Cellars

54023,Italy,"Sure this Barolo is slightly on the ripe side with mature fruit notes of strawberry and raspberry aromas.

54024,US,"This beautiful Bordeaux blend is based mostly on Cabernet Sauvignon.

54025,US,"Immediately appealing, this blend of 39% Cab Franc, 36% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, and 9% Petit Verdot really expands the midpalate, without sacrificing the overall muscularity and density that are the hallmarks of Stevens reds. The best 424 to date, this brings Petit Verdot into the blend for the first time, expanding the floral aromatics and deepening the tannins. Fruits are a complex mix of black cherry, blackberry and raisin, with licorice streaking into the finish.",424 Red Blend,92,33.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Stevens
54026,Italy,"Here's a very attractive and seductive Barolo with chiseled mineral tones that really help the wine stand out in a crowd.

54027,US,"Young and oaky now, with toast, vanilla and woodspice aromas and flavors that tend to dominate the underlying cherry, cranberry and raspberry fruit.

54028,France,"A wood-fermented wine (in 225 litre barrels), this is naturally a rich Champagne.

54030,Chile,"Melony and fleshy as most Central Valley SBs tend to be. There's not much zap, crispness or life blood here, so catch it now for the minimal amount of lemon and green apple it's giving. Finishes wet and round, with some mild bitterness.",,83,9.0,Maule Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Sundance

54032,Chile,"Dry, earthy and leafy, with herbal red-fruit aromas. The palate has a lean scratchiness to it along with snappy, drying, roasted berry flavors. Burns a bit on the finish and overall it doesn't bring enough body and ripeness to the table.",Armador,83,12.0,Maipo Valley,,,Merlot,Odfjell
54033,US,"Good blackberry fruit in this wine, but the tannins are pretty strong, and so is the acidity, which gives a sharp, green mint feeling that grows stronger through the finish. Ready now.",,83,24.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Syrah,San Simeon

54035,US,"Stiff and leathery, this 100% varietal Carmenère is barely ripe, with alcohol at 12.6% and green, stemmy tannins.

54039,Italy,"There are pungent aromas here of alcohol and fruit, that when coupled with the wine's naturally high acidity, rip through the palate with determination and force. There's also a very strong oak element here that has yet to find harmony with the rest of the wine.",Vigna del Salice,82,,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,,Barbera,Franco Mondo
54040,US,"Too soft in structure, with a collapsed feeling behind the cherry-berry flavors, and also too high in alcohol. Glycerine gives the wine a sweet taste, although it's probably technically dry.",,82,19.0,California,Calaveras County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Chatom
54041,Australia,"The other four d'Arenberg stickies from 2008 are top-notch, so the winery can be forgiven this misstep.

54042,Chile,"Oily, chunky and smelling of cider. The palate seems more flat and cloying than it should be for Casablanca, and the flavors are jumbled melon and generic tropical fruits.

54060,US,"This is the first reserve from Dusted Valley; it's dense, black and deeply scented with smoke, pepper, blackberry, black cherry, tobacco and licorice. It's 100% Syrah, and it's muscular and meaty, with appropriate streaks of herb, earth, bark and even some floral top notes.

54061,Chile,"Looking for a juggernaut red that cries out for steak? Give this lush, stylish, nearly flawless Carmenère a shot and you won't be disappointed. The nose opens with toast, mineral, herbs, olive and berry fruit, and the palate is more of the same. In terms of feel, it's smooth and elegant, yet ripe and forceful. Finishes crusty and long. A winner from a winery that up until now hasn't shown much.",Cuvée,91,20.0,Rapel Valley,,,Carmenère,Misiones de Rengo
54062,Austria,"A great mouthful of rich sweetness, toffee rounding an already velvet texture. The wine, with its liquid honey and mango flavors, feels full-bodied.

54063,US,"Smooth and supple, this Helix Syrah is consistent with past efforts. There's more than a trace of herb and earth, plenty of acid and some tannins with more than a hint of compost and green tea.

54064,Chile,"Great wine and great value, too. The nose is a blend of floral, graphite and cassis aromas, while the firm and rugged palate is packed with sweet, friendly cookie, chocolate, coffee and berry flavors.

54066,Chile,"Big and saturated is the best way to describe this mammoth blend of Cabernet, Carmenère and Cab Franc. It's full of ripe fruit, coconut and cassis on the nose.

54073,US,"Fragrant and expressive, it's got a wonderful lift to the plummy fruit which is spiced up with clove and gamy scents of smoked and cured meats.

54074,US,"A muscular, dense and tannic Syrah with a distinctive mineral underpinning. The expression is focused on concentrated, tightly wound blackberry and cassis, with some alcoholic heat.

54075,US,"This Bordeaux-style blend—60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Merlot and 6% Cab Franc—comes from Pepper Bridge, Seven Hills and McClellan vineyard fruit. Round and approachable, it puts the sweet and tangy flavors of cherry and berry front and center, yet has the structure to age for up to a decade.

It's a definite re-issue in that it was first released at $25 in 2006 but was put back on the market last year at $15.

54168,Australia,"Seems heavily extracted, with a dark, nearly impenetrable hue and dense, chocolaty aromas.

54181,US,"Almost entirely Merlot, with a few drops of other Bordeaux varieties, this Howell Mountain red screams for time in the cellar. The tannins bite and dog the mouth through the long, astringent finish. But chew on it for a while and you hit a deep core of blackberries and currants, and the more the wine warms up in the glass, the more impressive it gets. Cellar until 2010, and it should reward for years after.",Red Wine,95,75.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Duckhorn
54182,France,"With its distinctive bouquet of rose petals and lychee fruit, this dessert wine's Gewürztraminer character shines clearly through a modest veil of botrytis.

54183,Spain,"Our wine of the year in 2007 (the '04 El Puntido) is back with a vengeance in the 2005 vintage.

54184,US,"Classic structured, firm and soft at the same time, with a lyrical, creamy mouthfeel. The tannins are evident now, but that is characteristic of a young Georges, and the reason it ages so well. The depth of blackberries, cherries and currants is unreal and persistent. This is one for the cellar and will age for at least a decade and probably far longer. Try to keep your hands off it until after 2011.",Georges de Latour Private Reserve,95,105.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beaulieu Vineyard
54185,Germany,"Filled with minerality, spice and everything nice, this incredibly intense wine is also filled with honey, gently caramelized peaches and citrus.

54186,US,"Where Girard's estate Cab is beautiful now, their Diamond Mountain bottling is one for the cellar. Veteran winemaker Marco DiGiulio has applied his considerable experience, with classic results. The wine is marked by firm tannins that make it astringent and sticky. But underneath all that is an explosion of currant, plum, licorice, chocolate and spicy curry flavor that dazzles. Should easily age for a long time in a proper cellar. Production was a paltry 325 cases, and worth the search.",,95,75.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Girard
54187,Italy,"Here is a standout dessert wine from Italy's Friuli region with a deep amber color and generous aromas of chestnut honey, apricot and almond paste.

54189,Germany,"At only 6% alcohol, this is extremely honeyed on the nose—almost caramelized in its intensity.

54190,US,"Duckhorn's Three Palms bottling is one of the oldest and most consistent Merlot vineyard designations in California and this is a classic example. The wine always is very tannic.

54191,Germany,"This is a big step up in quality from Erbes' one-star bottling this vintage, offering greater intensity, purity and raciness.

Completely dry, this beautiful wine should age well for six years or more.",Estate Grown,94,85.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Duckhorn
54194,US,"This is easily Girard's finest estate Cab in recent memory. It's entirely drinkable now for the softly tannic mouthfeel and lush flavors of black currants, dark chocolate and anise that are so luxuriantly oaked.

54196,Spain,"With the exact same rating as the awesome 2004, this new vintage of Aurus is an unbridled winner. It's a little creamy and sweet on first blush, but time and air reveals its darker, more serious side. Flavors of blackberry, barbecued beef and fudge tell all you need to know about ripeness and richness, and among the new classics of Rioja, Aurus is one of the leaders.

54197,US,"The winery's reserve Chard has consistently been the best among their five Chards. The '05 is a dramatic wine, although oak-o-phobes might find it toothpicky.

54198,US,"Morgan's Hat Trick Chardonnay, from his own vineyard, was a hit right out of the block. Now, so is his Pinot Noir. It's elaborately flavored, a fairly soft, full-bodied wine that's stuffed with pastry-filling cherries, blackberries, currants and raspberries, with exotic additions of kumquats, cola, red licorice and vanilla.

54203,US,"Sangiovese has been a major disappointment in Napa Valley, but guess what? This 97% Sangiovese, with 3% Cabernet Sauvignon, is an impressive wine, and the best of Gargiulo's current releases. It's enormously forward in cherry pastry filling flavors, while plenty of new oak adds smoky, cinnamon spicy, vanilla brulée complexities, but it's the quality of the tannins that marks the wine. For all its flamboyance, it doesn't seem like an ager. Best now through 2011.",Aprile,93,40.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Red Blend,Gargiulo

54207,US,"Pepper, acidity and tannins are the stars of this young, unresolved Syrah. Under all that is a solid core of blackberries and blueberries that have a slight baked quality, like fruit in a pie. The wine needs time to knit together.

54210,US,"Make this wine a little drier and the score would rise.

Complex wine with an immense future.",Barrel sample,97,,Bordeaux,Barsac,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Coutet
54351,France,"96-98 Barrel sample. So velvet, you cannot imagine that this is also a powerfully dense and tannic wine.

Under the extreme richness, powerful chocolate and delicious final acidity.",Barrel sample,97,,Bordeaux,Pauillac,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Latour
54352,France,"96-98 Barrel sample. A powerful wine, packed with tannins from structured Cabernet fruits. It exudes muscularity, intensity and concentration. The wood element is present. Maybe the final freshness is missing.",Barrel sample,97,,Bordeaux,Saint-Julien,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Léoville Las Cases
54353,France,"96-98 Barrel sample. A powerful, complex wine, its layers of sweetness mixed with a total dryness from botrytis. The wine is impressively rich, considerably inspired by dried fruits and spice. Certainly for aging over decades.",Barrel sample,97,,Bordeaux,Sauternes,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château la Tour Blanche

54355,France,"96-98 Barrel sample. Concentrated and dense, this is a wine that fits well into the power of 2009.

54360,US,"Predominantly Sagemoor vineyard, along with some Champoux and estate grapes, including some old vine fruit and 13% Syrah. Somehow, the Artist Series Cabernet has an open softness that seems more like Merlot; it's lush and approachable, sleek and liquorous, dotted with malted milk/chocolate highlights around deep black cherry fruit. The aromas are lovely, though at first taste it sags a bit in the late going; the fruit falls off and the chocolaty notes take over. The tannins have a little green tea flavor.",Artist Series #15,91,49.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Cabernet Sauvignon,Woodward Canyon
54361,Italy,"Toasted notes of roasted almond, popcorn, dark coffee and vanilla extract set the stage. Doppiozeta is a new wine from Zisola that offers soft, sweet flavors and bright fruit succulence. Pair this wine with lamb, beef or pork.",Doppiozeta,91,50.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Red Blend,Zisola
54362,Argentina,"A rich and creamy wine with good structure and plenty of fruit. The nose yields berry essence, vanilla and smoky wood notes, while the palate has depth, layering and composed flavors. There's coffee and chocolate on the finish, and the texture and length seem just right. It's oaky for sure, but this vintage of Q can handle it.

54364,France,"Flavors of high toast wood are very dominant in this wine, and mingle with green herb, ripe pineapple and spice. The acidity cuts through it all, a band of freshness that comes with the structure of green plum skins. It could well age, and will certainly integrate more in the next two years.",Les Caradeux Premier Cru,90,60.0,Burgundy,Pernand-Vergelesses,,Chardonnay,Chanson Père et Fils

54366,US,"Aromatic and highly textural. The wine brings out a lot of citrus rind, tart stone fruits, and leesy texture. There's plenty of acid and hints of an underlying minerality with no hot alcohol burn. Just a little hint of stem in the tannins.",,90,20.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Viognier,Dusted Valley
54367,France,"A wine that brings out soft richness, with a creamy apple texture layered with green plum skin tannins. The wine has some tautness as well, giving a tight structure that opens up. There's a great mineral, steely streak, with freshness showing through on the finish.",Fourchaume Premier Cru,90,56.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Faiveley
54368,Chile,"Smells a little jumbled out of the chute, but in no time it rounds into form. The nose turns out to be rich, jammy and convincing, while the palate is robust and features ripe plum and berry flavors. For bold fruit, vigor and drive, this answers the call. It could probably stand to be more elegant and nuanced, but as is it's a fine mix of Carmenère, Cabernet and Syrah.",,90,55.0,Maipo Valley,,,Red Blend,Antiyal
54369,Italy,"This non-filtered wine is not totally limpid in appearance although it does come on strong in terms of the intensity of its aromas.

54373,Chile,"Dark, dense and very modern in style, with captivating aromas and obvious richness. At 14.5%, this is big, New World Pinot Noir. But its flavors of black cherry, raspberry and cola nut are elevated and brush up against world class.

54374,France,"The relatively unknown Côte de Léchet vineyard is on the southern bank of the Serein river, which gives it a cool exposure.

It needs food, with its crisp, fine finish.",Côte de Léchet Premier Cru,90,30.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,La Chablisienne
54375,France,"A ripe, full wine, immediately accessible, speaking both of minerality and fresh acidity.

A wine for aging, perhaps 2–3 years.",Mont de Milieu Premier Cru,90,35.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,La Chablisienne
54376,US,"This is a fancy Chardonnay. It impresses for the ripe tropical fruit and citrus flavors that are generously oaked, and for the crisp coastal acidity that provides balance. The overall impression is of pineapple-infused crème brûlée. Drink now.",Heintz Vineyard,90,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Suacci Carciere Wines
54377,Chile,"Tasted alongside the burly 2004, this wine is slightly more dry and dusty. Its nose offers Odfjell's patented richness and ripeness along with kirsch and candy. But with all that, it's balanced and pushes up against elegance. There's even a hint of mushroom and Sherry if you dig deep enough. Interesting for Cab Franc, but very different than the Loire or Bordeaux version; this is much riper.",Orzada,90,20.0,Maule Valley,,,Cabernet Franc,Odfjell
54378,France,"This exuberant wine has pineapple, pepper and perfumed toast. It is open, generous, kept in check with some crisp acidity, but essentially rich, lively and buttery.

54380,US,"Very big, very dry and powerful, a Pinot that explodes with lush cherry jam, red currant, chocolate and spice flavors wrapped into a tannic and frankly acidic young wine. If you pop the cork now, give it a good decant.",Hein Family Vineyard,90,46.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Roessler
54381,US,"The toughness of this wine works in its favor, giving it a chewy mouthfeel that balances and grounds the sweet currant, cassis and licorice flavors. Notes of black pepper, tobacco and herbs add to this impression of earthiness. It's a lovely wine, and fully drinkable now.",Alisos Vineyard,90,44.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,P2
54382,Italy,"This special vineyard selection offers depth and personality in the form of black stone, granite, balsam, cola, mature blackberry and background renderings of spice and toast.

54385,US,"A mix of vineyard sources accentuates the strawberry and cherry-preserve fruit flavors with dappled herb and earth. The effect is to add detail without mass, and it makes for a wine whose flavors belie its almost-15% alcohol. Sweet black-cherry fruit and a lick of espresso from the mix of barrels make this an exceptional Syrah for the price.",,90,19.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,San Juan Vineyards
54386,US,"Made from Grenache and Syrah, this Rhône-style blend has pronounced flavors of cherries, accented with sweet, vanilla-tinged new oak.

Best now for freshness.",The Brat,90,36.0,California,Calaveras County,Sierra Foothills,Grenache-Syrah,Prospect 772
54387,US,"This unusual wine, from Dunham's estate vineyard, is dark and shows Rhône-like flavors of blood and cured meats. The fruit is tart—wild berry and cranberry flavors just on the edge of herbal, but laden with grace notes of herb, mineral and coffee. It's a pleasure to taste a Washington Syrah with this complexity at a very French (13%) level of alcohol.",Double River Estate Vineyard,90,65.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Dunham

54389,Chile,"Ripe almost to the point of overdone, but then it draws itself back. The nose is one part baked and one part ripe cassis and blackberry. And the palate is more or less the same thing: cassis, berry, savory roasted flavors and chocolate are all present and accounted for. Finishes with a splash of BBQ and brandied cherry. A big, broad blend of Syrah, Cabernet, Merlot and Malbec. Drink now through 2010.",Gold Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot-Malbec,90,23.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Red Blend,Estampa
54390,US,"This young Pinot is rather fruity and heavy now, like the liquid version of a raspberry and cherry pie. Yet it has vibrant acidity and fine tannins, leading to the eternal question: Will it age to something more refined? My bet is yes. Give it 5–6 years.",Estate,90,65.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Regale Winery and Vineyards
54391,US,"Young and spicy, with deeply-etched cranberry fruit flavors, limned with leafy herbal tannins. The core of fruit is pretty as can be, and the nicely-managed tannins wrap it in a perfect frame, while giving it added muscle. Another two or three years in the bottle will really bring this into focus.",JV Estate,90,25.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Stoller
54392,US,"Great entry, soft and seductive, with cherry and chocolate, but it dies quickly, fading into a delicate malted milk flavor. Re-tasted after being open for several hours, it had gained a little flesh, retained the milk chocolate flavors, but still seemed to need more bottle age to soften up the finish.",Estate Cuvée,90,50.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Sokol Blosser
54393,US,"The Goosepen bottling is distinctive, elegant and spicy, with a mix of baking spices, soft fruits, chocolate, coconut and butter.

54399,US,"Like the winery's “Fuller” Pinot Noir, this special, limited-edition offering honors some Oregon wine industry stalwarts, the owners of Elton Vineyards. It clearly reflects the flavors of the Eola-Amity Hills AVA—no tricks or attempts to hide the natural earthy, herbal character.

The low price will also win you over.",Benuara,89,16.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Red Blend,Cusumano

54405,Argentina,"Dark and heavily oaked on first blush, but give it time to unwind or let it sit in the bottle for a year or two and this will satisfy any Malbec lover. Early on, it's dense and full of shoe polish, mint and coconut; later it spreads out to show sweet dark-berry flavors and finally a rich, almost sticky finish of woodspice, brown sugar and lushness.",Reserva,89,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Domaine Jean Bousquet

54408,US,"A lovely dessert wine in almost every respect. It's crisp in acidity and has complex, somewhat oxidized or Madeira-like flavors of oranges, tapioca and vanilla.

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Debit,Gypsy Canyon
54409,US,"Beautiful, classic blackberry and currant fruit in this polished Cabernet, along with a rich, tasteful coat of sweet oak. The tannins are thick but refined.

54411,US,"Searing acidity marks this wine, which tastes like it has a lot of Edna Valley fruit in the blend. It also shows bright, strong, long hangtime flavors of limes and pineapples. It's actually quite a fine Chardonnay, dry and low in alcohol. A great value at this price.",,89,15.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Bishop's Peak
54412,US,"Marked by dryness and some heat from alcohol, this wine also has a rich core of ripe cherries. It's very strong and powerful, not a Zinfandel that's shy or apologizes for its brashness. But that's the essence of Rockpile. Drink this sturdy wine now, and the ideal food pairing is barbecue.",Rocky Reserve Florence Vineyard,89,33.0,California,Rockpile,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Carol Shelton
54413,US,"This is a very rich Chardonnay, almost too elaborated and overworked. It's tremendous in oak-infused fruit, with dominating buttered toast, crème brûlée and pineapple pie flavors.

54420,New Zealand,"Winemaker Alana McGettigan is an associate of Matt Thomson (Saint Clair, Delta), so it's no surprise this Sauvignon Blanc overdelivers.

54629,US,". Though it is five years old and just being released, this thick, tannic and rich Bordeaux blend still requires decanting, cellaring, and/or extensive breathing time. A full day after first being tasted, it came together for me; the initial, aggressively herbal character is equally matched to ripe black cherry fruit and massive tannins. The nose suggests sweet cherry, but the palate leans more to the herbal side, with flavors of earth, stem and leaf, and there is a green tea residual flavor that infuses the finish.

54698,New Zealand,"Winemaker Matt Dicey has teased out Pinot Noir's silky texture and ample complexity in this wine, one of his finest to date.

So you have a beguiling mix of aromatic, lightly soapy, perfumed, floral scents, matched to exotic passion fruit and grapefruity citrus. There is a lot of acid here, and it's a young wine, but it has wonderful concentration and a full-throttle mix of perfume, fruit and flesh. The finish seems endless, and promises a long life ahead.",Celilo Vineyard,92,22.0,Oregon,Columbia Gorge (OR),Oregon Other,Gewürztraminer,Dowsett Family
54781,Germany,"This is thick, rich and very beerenauslese-like, combining honey and dried apricot aromas with similar flavors and a touch of candied pineapple. It's sweeter and richer than the regular auslese, but only more appealing for true sugar hounds, who'll admire its extreme viscosity and long, mouthcoating finish.",Erdener Prälat Auslese Goldkap,92,58.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Dr. Loosen
54782,US,"This complex wine lists no fewer than eight different clones in the blend, harvested at an average of just 1.8 tons/acre. The winery suggests that it is their most ageworthy Pinot Noir, and the structure of this young wine would support that assertion. It's tight, hard, compact with black fruits, smoke and chewy tannins. It's a wine that needs time to stretch its considerable muscles. The roughly 50/50 mix of new and once-used barrels adds baking chocolate, licorice and charred toast to the finish; well-integrated and buttressed with crisp acids. But the lingering flavor is of raspberry jam; so good you want to spread it directly on your tongue.",Jerome Reserve,92,58.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Lemelson
54783,US,"A very good wine from a new winery that specializes in the other Cabernet, Cab Franc. Possesses the tannic structure of a fine Napa Bordeaux red, but not quite as heavy as Cabernet Sauvignon. Shows savory cherry, red currant and smoky cedar flavors. Best now through 2010.",,92,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Franc,Gridley
54784,Germany,"Almost tooth-achingly sweet, this nectar still retains an amazing level of fruit purity. It's floral and apple-y in its aromas, then offers pineapple, honey and melon fruit flavors. There's even some lime zest on the finish to partially offset the succulent sweetness.",Wehlener Sonnenuhr Auslese Goldkap,92,99.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Joh. Jos. Prüm
54785,US,"Good for the winery for producing a Cab Franc that's truly distinct and interesting. It doesn't have a vineyard designation, but it's from the highly regarded Truchard vineyard. With a firm core of dusty tannins and a heart of blackberries, black cherries, currants and black pepper, it's elegant, complex and ageworthy.",,92,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Franc,Peter Franus
54786,Italy,"Planeta's precious Moscato di Noto is always a pleasure to drink. This vintage is no exception; the wine is wonderfully generous and redolent of honey, apricot and bright yellow rose. It excels in the mouth, thanks to its perfect balance of sugar and acidity.",,92,40.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Moscato di Noto,Planeta
54787,US,"A captivating Chard that shows impeccable balance, and the price is very good for this level of quality. The fruit is brilliantly ripe in green apple, kiwi, Asian pear and lime flavors, with a deft touch of smoky oak. A firm minerality undergirds the structure.",,92,25.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Orogeny
54788,US,"This is the winery's priciest red and also its best. It immediately appeals for the soft, lush texture and the way the sweet fruit marries with the oak to wow the palate. Shows lush cherries and cassis, with rich nuances of vanilla, smoky wood and anise. Decadent and delicious, and best now through 2011. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, but comprised of all 5 Bordeaux varieties.",Red Wine,92,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Stephanie
54789,Spain,"Ripe and modern, with a bold color and no shortage of oak. But with clean black fruit, integration and great structure, the wine handles all the wood thrown at it. Expect black fruit, toast and wood spice on the palate, followed by a stylish, meaty finish. Ripe and complete, and drinkable now through 2010 at least.",Cuvée Especial,92,29.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Sierra Cantabria
54790,Spain,"Opaque in color, with reduced aromas of mushroom, rubber and so forth. But do not give up on this masculine bruiser; it will loosen up with air and offer plum, leather and chocolate flavors that are nothing short of excellent. And while it's a touch zesty at its core, the wine still mixes in enough coffee and richness to make it a modern-style success story.",Norte,92,92.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Pujanza
54791,US,"The winery's '05 Cab is tannic and dry and elegant. It tastes like a young Bordeaux, a wine that needs time in the cellar to come around. The flavors are classic Napa Cab, all black currants, black cherries and oak. Just beautiful. Best after 2009, but good now with decanting and a big, important steak.",,92,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Peter Franus
54792,US,"It would be a pity to open this wine anytime before, say, 2010, because it needs age. Now, and for a while, it will taste closed and tannic and raw. But such are the tannins and acids and overall balance, and the core of blackberries and cherries is so rich, that it should effortlessly negotiate the next decade.",,92,90.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vineyard 7&8
54793,US,"This is obviously a beautiful Cabernet Sauvignon. It shows the pedigree and class you expect from a winery of Staglin's level, enormously rich in black currant, mocha and cedar flavors, with ripe, soft and complex tannins. But the price is challenging. If you choose to buy and cellar, the wine should develop at least for several years.",Estate,92,175.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Staglin
54794,US,"Despite significant youthful tannins this Cab has such deep, ripe flavor that you can drink it now. The mouthfeel is astringent and hard, in the way of a young wine, but waves of cherries, blackberries and currants flatter the tastebuds, and it also softens as it warms up in the glass. A beautiful, polished drink that should develop over the next eight years.",Diamond Mountain Ranch,92,55.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sterling
54795,US,"A little brittle and tense now, with a young wine freshness. May just need time in the bottle to mellow. Give it until sometime in 2009 to let the tannins, acids and oak mesh with the lush cherry, red currant, pomegranate, cola and intense Asian spice flavors. Could develop through a decade.",Dutton-Thomas Road Vineyard,92,49.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Dutton Estate
54796,Italy,"Here's an organic Vin Santo from the heart of Chianti Classico that boasts beautiful harmony and creaminess with generous aromas of molasses, chestnut honey, dried apple and maple syrup.

54797,Italy,"La Tunella's Picolit exhibits a saturated golden color and ripe aromas of mature apricot, tangerine skin and citrus. You'll also recognize tones of honey, toasted nut and maple syrup. It's a chewy, viscous dessert wine with in-your-face intensity and a succulent, sweet finish.",,92,90.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,Picolit,La Tunella
54798,US,"An authoritative, distinguished Chard, from a producer with a good track record at this bottling. It's ripe and immediately appealing, in the California style, but despite 100% new oak, it doesn't taste oaky, and the citrus and tropical fruit flavors are balanced and complexed with wild herb and mineral notes. Should gain in interest over the next six years.",Cuvée Sauvage,92,50.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Franciscan
54799,US,"This wine seems to hark back to a time when Oregon really could lay claim to making Pinot Noirs that were truly Burgundian in style. Here you find that same elegance, the bright acids, the firm tannins, the tight red fruits, with a through line that suggests it is an ageworthy wine that is holding back more than it is showing, especially at this young age. Distinctive, beautifully structured, and worthy of its status.",Maresh Vineyard,92,42.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Sineann
54800,Portugal,"A supreme wine that tastes of intense maturity, touched with oxidation. It has gained in color as it ages, so now it is a deep green gold. To taste, it has much of the character of a tawny Port, with smoky old wood flavors. But the perfume, hinting at honey, is of a white Port.",30 Anos White,92,,Port,,,Port,Quinta Santa Eufemia
54801,US,"This bottling from EOS is almost always one of the most dependable and satisfying dessert wines in California, and the price is good compared to its peers. The '07 is a very good sweetie, a pace or two off the previous four vintages. But it offers rich, honeyed apricot, pineapple and crème brûlée flavors and is very sweet.",Tears of Dew Late Harvest,91,22.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Moscato,EOS
54802,Italy,"Hekate is an amber-colored dessert wine made from a blend of overripe grapes in central Sicily. Its aromas recall apricot, orange peel and chestnut honey and the wine offers special floral notes that last long over its silky mouthfeel. Hekate is named after a Greek goddess who bestowed kindness and wealth and was a guardian of youth.",Hekate Passito,91,30.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,White Blend,Feudo Arancio
54803,US,"Here's a polished Cab that's almost sweet in flavor, but it's actually a dry wine. Just oozes cherries, currants and raspberries, with a pastry richness that suggests a chocolate-covered nougat candy. Best now through 2011, and easy to find, with 51,000 cases produced.",,91,27.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beaulieu Vineyard

54806,US,"Morgan has been a real pioneer in the unoaked Chardonnay movement, and when the wine scores, it scores big. Consider this a run-scoring triple. It's totally dry, very acidic (officially, 7.13 g/L, for the statistically-minded) and austere, with a hard edge of minerals. What fruit there is suggests tart green apples and white nectarines. Believe me, you won't miss the oak.",Metallico Un-Oaked,91,22.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Morgan
54807,US,"If you prefer your California Chards on the minerally side instead of the flamboyant, superripe style, try this one. With its stony or metallic and citrus-inspired flavors and extreme dryness at low alcohol, it can be described as Chablisian. Hard to believe the oak is 100% new, as it doesn't taste oaky despite the streamlined profile.",Cupa Grandis,91,45.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Chardonnay,EOS
54808,Italy,"Privilegio (made with a blend of white grapes from Campania, in southern Italy, that are dried on racks after the harvest) delivers musky and sophisticated aromas of bright fruit, natural rubber, apricot, almond paste and baked apple pie.

54809,Australia,"A blend of 64% Merlot and 36% Cabernet Sauvignon, the resulting wine is complex, round and complete. Aromas and flavors of plum, leather, cured meat and spice are carried by plenty of weight, yet without seeming heavy. There's a lush, slightly creamy mouthfeel and a long, spicy finish. Delicious now, but should hold at least through 2015.",Abbotts Prayer Vineyard,91,75.0,South Australia,Lenswood,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Henschke

54811,US,"Good, ripe blackberry and currant fruit in this dry Cabernet, but the mouthfeel is a little off, for such an ambitious wine. The oak is too extracted, while the tannins are harsh. Feels overwrought, and not likely to improve much in the bottle.",Charles Towing Reverence Vineyard,86,70.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Calicaro
54812,US,"Nicely dry in the finish, with a good bite of acidity and smooth tannins. The weakness is a certain thinness of blackberry fruit. For the price, though, you get some elegance.",,86,15.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Don Patrick
54813,US,"This is an elegantly constructed wine. It's not especially rich, but subtle in citrus fruit, roasted nut, jasmine, vanilla and oak flavors, brightened with notable acidity. A note of green sage is distracting.",,86,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Freemark Abbey
54814,US,"A sound red wine, dry and full-bodied, with pleasant berry, herb, currant and smoked meat flavors that finish rich and sweet in ripe fruit. The winery doesn't reveal what varieties are in the blend.",,86,14.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Red Blend,Grandmaster

54835,Argentina,"A big drop off from prior years, probably due to the cold harvest conditions of 2008. Smells minty and lactic, with hard spice and distant fruit aromas.

55052,US,"Could finish drier, as there's a sugary sweetness throughout. But a lemony scour of acidity helps, and the flavors are extraordinarily rich, suggesting lemon meringue pie and pineapple marmalade.",,86,56.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Alpha Omega
55053,Spain,"A little funky and damp smelling initially, with leather and herbal notes to go with standard blackberry aromas. The palate is warm, full and solid, with sweet but regular black fruit flavors in front of a cherry/berry finish. Totally generic for Rioja but still good.",Dominio de la Plana,86,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Red Blend,Bodegas Luis Gurpegui Muga
55054,Spain,"Leafy and smoky on the nose, with a firm, crusty topping. The palate is driving but has sheering acidity, while the palate shows blazing cherry, plum and tomato flavors.

55055,Spain,"A lot of toasty oak on the nose announces this wine's barrel-fermented roots, and additional lemon and apple aromas are classy. In the mouth, however, it runs narrow, with sugary, almost late-harvest flavors of honey, mango and pineapple. A different style of Godello that's sweet and soft.

55057,Chile,"Pretty honest on the nose, where it's mostly melony, peachy fruit and no faux oak. The palate is on the sharp side, with blazing acidity and not much body to go with citrus and apple flavors. Hits you with a lot of juiciness and aggression but doesn't bring a lot of mouthfeel and complexity.",Gran Reserva Cuvée,86,20.0,Leyda Valley,,,Chardonnay,Misiones de Rengo
55058,US,"This is a very sweet wine, with a honeyed, sugary taste to the tangerines and apricots.

55060,US,"With alcohol listed at 15.5%, it is reasonable to expect this Cab to fill the palate with rich, lush fruit. It falls a bit short, feeling tight and tannic. The tart berry fruit quickly runs into astringent, rather hard tannins, hinting at bitter seeds. Perhaps more time in the bottle will help to fill it out.",Wild Sky,86,30.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Zero One Vintners

55068,US,"Tight and sharp, this brings just barely ripe flavors of cranberry and sour raspberry.

55071,US,"Checking in at a whopping 15.8% alcohol, this take-no-prisoners Merlot marries Port-like fruit to ripe, rich, massive tannins and a chocolaty wash of oak. There is enough acid to hold it all together—in fact, it may profit from another year or two in bottle.

55074,Spain,"Smells baked and a little sweet, and also a touch raisiny.

55075,US,"Borra's Fusion is a bottle full of Lodi's traditional varietals.

55095,US,"Sometimes a reserve designation on a Chardonnay simply translates to excessive use of new oak; here it brings a rich abundance of fruit, along with a density and texture rarely found in domestic Chardonnays. This is a fruit salad of a wine, to be sure, running through a farmer's market's worth of peaches, apples, pears, apricots, bananas and more.

55324,US,"Medium weight, round and tangy, this shows a core of cranberry/cherry fruit, a whiff of cola and a suggestion of the tack room. It's a detailed and somewhat earthy Pinot Noir. From the estate vineyard, it's what you hope to find in Oregon— Pinot that is artisanal, a little quirky, distinctive and above all, enjoyable.

55337,Argentina,"Lively but also narrow on the nose. The feel is very fresh and juicy due to firm, bracing acidity that gives a tangy, lemony character to the wine's dark-fruit core.

55594,US,"A portion of this is estate grown, the rest sourced from neighboring southern Oregon vineyards. Harvested at just 24 brix, it's an elegant style, with plenty of tart wild berry flavors, and alcohol under 14%.

55606,Argentina,"A tale of two wines. The early impression is that of a foxy, incomplete, sweaty wine with gaps in the fabric. But once it gets air, things turn around for the better. Ultimately it proves itself as a serious Malbec with a broad texture and jammy, sweet berry fruit. But it starts out so scattered and funky that it remains compromised.",Brote Negro,88,100.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Viña Alicia
55607,Italy,"A distinctive expression of Nero d'Avola with ripe fruit flavors, blackberry preserves, tobacco, spice and leather.

Very nice Malbec with a cool identity.",Reserve,88,19.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Salentein
55613,Italy,"Alastro is a food-friendly blend of Grecanico and Chardonnay. Grecanico adds fresh, floral aromas and the Chardonnay gives the wine its creamy, smooth texture.

55617,Italy,"The Feudo Principi di Butera estate releases this Cab five or more years after the harvest, although a good argument could be made that it should be released sooner.

55628,US,"As can happen with young wines like just-released rosé, a slight bit of effervescence is visible. The interesting smell of fermentation gives rise to strawberry and pink bubblegum scents.

And while we still appreciate the wine's intensity and power, this vintage pushes so much espresso, burnt nut and rubber that it probably won't impress all comers.

55684,Spain,"Questionable value at $70, but this is very good and rather unique white Rioja. Remelluri uses a multitude of common and unheard-of grapes, and they hit it with a lot of oak. Still, amid the oily richness there's balance, acidity and excellent layering of grass, spice, apple, banana and lemon flavors.

55694,Australia,"This is a little slow out of the gate, starting off with some rather cabbage-like aromas. Over time, the odors evolve toward smoke and ash, and, finally, into a complex, cedary aroma. The flavors of this medium-bodied blend (80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Malbec, 8% Merlot, 2% Petit Verdot) feature blackberry and cassis, but also fold in hints of smoked meat and vanilla before finishing crisp and long.

It's deep, plummy, laced with complex flavors that begin with ripe and tangy red berries and black cherries, and lead into accents of coffee, earth and baking chocolate. The tangy natural acids keep this wine sharp and focused, and the Italian varieties seem to bump up the sweetness in the finish.",,89,24.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Cabernet Sauvignon,Nelms Road

55870,France,"Very soft, this offers generous white fruits, with a rounded, open structure. It rolls around the mouth, opulent and full.

The aromas are pure varietal—violets and red fruits—and the fruit flavors are young and tart, suggesting watermelon, strawberry and wild raspberry. The tannins are ripe but still a bit sharp, and there is a classic finish of roasted coffee that seems more from the grape than the barrels.

55895,US,"Kudos to winemakers Adam and Dianna Lee for managing to wrest a Syrah this likeable from the difficult 2011 vintage. It's almost worth aging, with a delicious core of molten blackberries, black currants and green tea, and significant tannins, the kind that lock the palate down.

56190,US,"An interesting and complex young Syrah that really needs bottle age to show its best. It's very fruity, offering a blast of currants and pepper, but also pretty astringent in bitter tannins.

56200,US,"Very high alcohol has resulted in this dark, glyceriney wine being entirely dry, but also a little hot, and definitely heady.

56212,US,"A blend of Syrah and Mourvèdre, this is a lovely, polished and serious red wine.

56213,Italy,"Here's a unique Garganega-based dessert wine with aromas of apricot and toasted nut followed by sun-dried banana or papaya, with lemon zest and almond paste.

56214,France,"With its softness and medium-dry character, this is a great food wine for pâtés or blue cheese. It is finely in balance, its acidity giving a lift to the tangerine, peach and dried fruit flavors.

56215,Greece,"Dark cherry, plum and clove lead on this enticing red from the Peloponnese. On the palate, a blend of dark chocolate, cherry and vanilla spice offers complexity and assertive flavor.

56216,Germany,"This offering from the Mosel's most hallowed site starts off thick and unctuous in the mouth, yet lacks the persistence and intensity of flavor exhibited by some of its 2006 counterparts.

56218,Spain,"Clean, inviting and lively, with pure berry character spread across the nose and palate.

56255,US,"There's a lot to praise and also lots to criticize in this Cab. It's richly tannic and nicely oaked, with lush black currant and smoky oak flavors.

56404,France,"A soft, rich and ripe wine, showing some light wood character and delicious forward pears and yellow plums, plus a crisp line of acidity that gives the wine a vivid lift and extra freshness.

The relative lightness of the fruit is compensated for by the textural layering of leaf, berry, barrel and tannin.

56516,Spain,"Very nice red wine but for $112 we want to be forced to take notice, and frankly that doesn't really happen here. Still, the wine goes snap, crackle and pop on both the bouquet and palate. It's a crisp one, with live-wire cherry, cola and spice flavors. Not at all flabby, and instead runs lean and fresh.

56753,Spain,"Rubbery, rooty aromas of herbs and berries blend with stalky red-fruit notes.

56754,US,"This southern Rhône-style blend is 70% Grenache, 20% Cinsault and 10% Syrah, sourced from the excellent Olsen vineyard. That perfect fruit anchors a ripe, juicy and forward wine loaded with cherry/berry flavors.

56755,France,"With more weight than its partner Vie Vité, this is a rich wine, with red plum as well as berry fruits. Almonds, vanilla and a mineral texture all contribute to its natural ripeness.

56757,Slovenia,"Sivi Pinot is the Slovenian name for Pinot Gris and this will delight oenophiles looking for a new orange wine. It's pinkish brown in color due to two years of barrel aging and has aromas of peach cobbler and freshly baked piecrust.

56758,US,"Tempranlillo is not the most common base for California rosé, but this might change some minds. It veers into the orange spectrum of pink color, and smells like a grapefruit spritzer. On the palate, there's lemon bar, almond paste, and bubblegum, but any perceived sweetness is wiped away by brisk acidity and a slightly bitter quality too. The layers of flavor are impressive.",Indie,89,25.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Rosé,ONX

56767,Argentina,"A pretty white wine with lively aromas, flavors and feel.

56768,Argentina,"Blackberry, rubber and a suggestion of minerality work well as an invitation to this juicy, woody wine that's long and full in the mouth, with dark-fruit flavors of black cherry, blackberry and plum.

56789,Italy,"From the almost-extinct Pallagrello grape, this luminous white wine really holds its own in terms of personality and uniqueness. There are pretty mineral tones here but thanks to the wine's age (from the 2006 vintage), you'll also get more complex notes of butterscotch, caramel and apricot. You can feel the high alcohol on the close.",Acquavigna,87,19.0,Southern Italy,Terre del Volturno,,Pallagrello,Fattoria Selvanova
56790,US,"Here's a nice Pinot with some fancy edges. It's dry and silky and complex, with cherry, pomegranate, cola, red currant and pepper-anise flavors finished with smoky oak.

56792,Spain,"Fairly stylish and quite serious. There's darkness to the nose along with masculine, meaty, leathery aromas. And while the bouquet is sturdy and begs you to dig in, the palate is a little less generous as it shows some herbal sharpness at its core.

56798,Australia,"An icon in Australia, Mount Mary has never made a huge splash here in the States. Perhaps because such miniscule quantities are available (30 cases of the 2005 Quintet).

56804,US,"Here's a very dark, tannic, peppery wine, dry and rather soft in structural acidity. It floods the mouth with rich flavors of ripe, mashed blackberries, plums and chocolate, and something spicy and fruity, like Christmas rum punch.

56805,Spain,"Alberdi from La Rioja Alta is a slight throwback. The nose has more than a twinge of tomato leaf, wet clay, tobacco and raisin, but also maturity and floral notes akin to a good Burgundy.

56840,US,"A lot of stems and whole clusters go into the winemaking, adding spice and a chewy earthiness. The nose is scented with camphor, green tea and smoked ham. This is no fruit bomb, rather it's a wine that gathers itself in the midpalate and shows its real strength in the back half, as its layers of earth, soy, tomato leaf and rhubarb mix and mingle. Long, earthy and complex, this is moving closer and closer to a Cayuse style. It finishes with just a little bit of heat.",Wells,92,50.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,K Vintners
56841,US,"The wine from this tiny (two-acre) plot is almost jet-black, with a garnet/violet edge. Lavender and violets, black fruit and satiny tannins reveal more of the toasty oak than any other K single-vineyard Syrah. Grainy, textural and lush, with lots of pepper and citrus, this has the most sweetness in the black cherry fruit. Supple, silky, satiny and nicely detailed.",Phil Lane,91,70.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,K Vintners
56842,US,"The cool-climate fruit provides the bracing aromas, the lively texture, the crispness without bitterness, and fruit that doesn't veer into overripe peach or apricot. It's got an edge to it, but it's very clean, stylish and polished, with a nice level of intensity that has no bitter, hot or volatile elements.",,90,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Viognier,K Vintners
56843,US,"Fruit-forward, spicy and appealing, this is consistent with previous editions of this popular wine. Since 2005 is a particularly good year, this has more concentration and fruit power than usual. The tight blackberry core, wrapped in leaf and showing a lot of earthy flavors is particularly attractive. The oak is folded into the wine; finishes with focus, purity and balance.",Milbrandt,90,25.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Syrah,K Vintners
56844,US,"The Boy is 88% Grenache and 12% Syrah; the Grenache comes from Christophe Baron's biodynamic Armada vineyard. It's got a composty undertone to the fruit, with plenty of spice and earthy elements. There is a citrus component also. It's very smoky, very earthy and gamy. The tannins are smooth, but very earthy and leafy, with some bitterness. An intriguing wine.",The Boy,89,40.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,K Vintners
56845,Australia,"Despite being loaded with complexity—spicy, meaty, savory and vanilla notes all feature in this wine—there's also explosive fruit. Swirls of blueberry and blackberry flavors are head-spinning and the texture is compellingly rich and velvety. If that isn't enough, the finish lasts for minutes. A blend of Shiraz from eight vineyards, all at least 90 years old, plus a tiny proportion (3%) of Viognier. Drink now–2024.",RunRig,98,220.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz-Viognier,Torbreck
56846,Australia,"Tarry and peppery, dark and meaty, it's difficult to describe how a wine that is so packed with lush blackberry and plum fruit can remain complex. The fruit completely fills the mouth, yet nuances of spicy, meaty complexity somehow permeate, building in intensity on the long finish. Supple enough to drink now, but should evolve positively through at least 2015 and last another 5–10 years beyond that.",The Factor,97,105.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Torbreck
56847,Australia,"This is incredibly dark, concentrated stuff from what may be the oldest (planted in 1886) continuously producing Cabernet vineyard in the world. Minty, herbal notes combine with chocolate and cassis to yield a complex, balanced whole. Despite the density of the fruit, there's absolutely no sense of heaviness or excessive weight, and while the tannins appear creamy on the midpalate, they fan out into a silky sheen on the lingering finish. About 500 cases produced. Drink 2012–2030.",Block 42 Kalimna,97,225.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Penfolds
56848,US,"100% estate grown, this truly exceptional Cabernet, Merlot and Petit Verdot blend opens with angular, vertical fruit flavors, stacked tightly and detailed with citrus, graphite and chalk. The layered mid-palate mixes grape, berry, cherry and plum, sweet and dense. The oak is applied moderately, not dominating as in past Leonetti reserves. It's a profound wine with a gorgeous, entrancing structure that is barely beginning its evolution. Flavors emerge in surprising succession, like spring wildflowers that pop up overnight. A remarkable achievement, and quite possibly the best wine ever made by Leonetti.",Reserve,97,110.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Blend,Leonetti Cellar
56849,Australia,"Underneath a slightly smoky, toasty exterior lies an explosion of cherry, raspberry and black cherry fruit that's wonderfully pure without being simple. The texture is creamy and lush without being unstructured or jammy, while the finish goes on and on. Drink now–2020.",Eligo,96,100.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,John Duval Wines

56851,Italy,"This playful rosé is marked by a saccharine, cotton candy quality that will remind you of cherry cough drops or raspberry lollipop. It's a simple, no-fuss, beautifully packaged wine with a subtle touch of bitter astringency on the close.",Negroamaro,83,,Southern Italy,Salento,,Rosé,Villa Mottura
56852,Spain,"Almost volatile, but with reduced raisin below. If you are familiar with   hot-climate California Zinfandel, this is not unlike that. It has a vinegary attack and then a strange but limited sweetness lurking in the weeds. A   challenged wine.",Javier Asensio Tinto,83,10.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Red Blend,Asensio
56853,US,"A candied nose of raspberry and pepper starts this wine out on a slightly clumsy note, but on the palate, the wine offers solid, if slightly simple, flavors. The finish impresses with its warm, spicy wave.",,83,19.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Sauvignon,Keuka Spring
56854,Australia,"With its ample body and complex touches of chocolate, plum and spice, this is clearly a serious attempt at rosé, just one that seems a bit tired at this stage of its evolution. Drink up.",Saignée Rosé,83,15.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,Shiraz,Margan
56855,US,"A pretty nose of violets, cherry and pepper start this fun and friendly wine from Virginia. On the palate, somewhat straightforward cherry and spice are flavorful and solid. A good wine that will pair nicely with spicier cuisine—think Middle Eastern or tomato-based Italian dishes.",,83,19.0,Virginia,Virginia,,Cabernet Franc,Chateau Morrisette
56856,Italy,"The wine's aromas are simple and rather monothematic and recall apple cider or pear juice. There's even a slight veil in its appearance and a gritty texture that further reinforces that pear juice impression. That said, Bisceglia is an up and coming modern winery and one worth keeping an eye on in the future.",,83,,Southern Italy,Basilicata,,Chardonnay,Bisceglia
56857,Spain,"Very dark and seemingly on the cooked side of the ledger. The nose is black and raisiny, while the core flavors are saucy. At least this meaty, overdone Garnacha isn't oaked, so in that sense it isn't offensive. But it is definitely soft, and without much future.",Viñas Viejas,83,11.0,Northern Spain,Calatayud,,Garnacha,Bodegas Agustín Cubero
56858,US,"A plucky nose of fruitcake and spice leads off. On the palate, good, robust red fruit, a solid, dry and minerally backbone and a touch of oak offer dimension and balance. A bit rough and ready, the wine will benefit from pairing with grilled meats or spicy dishes that can match its energy.",Calvin Clarion,83,28.0,New Mexico,New Mexico,,Red Blend,Casa Rondeña Winery
56859,Spain,"Airén is a big-crop white grape that is usually distilled into brandy or made into Sherry. But here we see it as a dry white table wine, and while it is limited in scope, the wine's punch-bowl approach and cleansing lime and kiwi flavors are decent.",,83,8.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Airen,Sierra Virgen
56860,Italy,"Nero Latino lacks harmony overall because of its rapid succession of unrelated aromas: Red apple is followed by mushroom, beets, strawberry, chocolate and smoke. It also has an extremely strong component of coffee rinds that appears on both the nose and in the mouth. It's not a wine for everyone.",Nero Latino,83,,Southern Italy,Irpinia,,Aglianico,Mier Vini

56862,Spain,"Apple and powdery citrus aromas are austere but intriguing. But in the mouth, this thing foams like bubble bath. No matter whether you like the wine's citric flavors and apple essence or not, the fact that it bubbles up like a shaken soda is not an attribute. Oriel's gran reserva is similar in terms of carbonation issues.",Brut,82,18.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Oriol Rossell
56863,US,"Though this wine offers the vibrant cherry fruit and pepper of a good New York Cab Franc, it's a bit one-dimensional. On the nose, candied cherry and spice lead, followed by a slightly tart wave of cherry. Oak adds just a bit of interest. Pair with duck or fowl to soften it.",,82,18.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Franc,Ravines

56865,US,"Affordable and friendly, this refreshing wine offers strawberry jam and orange marmalade on the nose and a mineral-driven flavor profile. The fruit is overtaken by the acidity to some extent, but the wine still makes for a tasty warm weather sip.",Ciera,82,9.0,New York,New York,New York Other,Rosé,Long Point
56866,US,"Unbalanced, with weedy, grassy flavors side by side with sweet spearmint chewing gum and pineapple LifeSaver candy. Crisp acidity gives it the sweet-sour taste of certain Chinese sauces.",Nouvelle Génération,82,24.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Taylor
56867,US,"This Cabernet Franc has a slightly watery, sweet fruit element that lacks the cheerful vibrancy and pluckiness of the variety. On the nose, it offers soft red fruit and some spice, but the flavors feel weak. Not a bad wine overall, but needs some muscle.",,82,17.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Franc,Sheldrake Point
56868,Spain,"Brambly and tart, with a peppery, leathery nose. It's zesty, lightly concentrated Garnacha with zingy, mouth-burning raspberry and plum flavors. A sharp, reticent wine in every way. Imported by USA Wine Imports.",Ladera,82,21.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Garnacha,Algairen
56869,Spain,"A lesson in contrasts: the nose is both weedy and sweet, with green strawberry aromas mixing with caramel. The palate is also green and slightly bitter, but that's offset by some jammy berry sweetness. Medium in terms of weight, but with burdensome sugars and a clumsy finish.",Vertus Crianza,82,15.0,Levante,Utiel-Requena,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Iranzo
56870,US,"With the heat of very high alcohol, the taste of overripe, raisiny fruit and a sweet finish, this is not a successful wine. But then, Mourvèdre is notoriously difficult to control.",El Alacran,82,35.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Mourvèdre,Karly
56871,US,"Cinnamon and spiced berry—a seductive combination—lead this Cab from the Finger Lakes, but on the palate, cherry, pepper and spice flavors fall a bit flat.

56876,US,"This Bordeaux-style red starts promisingly, with a big nose of smoky meat, tobacco and pepper, but on the palate, there's a slightly rubbery edge and the fruit needs more complexity. Tannins are good. In the right direction but not quite hitting the mark.",Francesca Rossa,82,13.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Bellangelo
56877,US,"The nose on this Viognier is a touch off and slightly green, and on the palate, thin flavors lack the curvy allure of the variety. Still, the wine has a clean character and overall easy drinking quality that recommends it.",V°,82,20.0,Colorado,Grand Valley,,Viognier,Garfield Estates

56882,US,"Nothing subtle about this big, ripe, oaky Chardonnay.

56883,Italy,"Braccale is a drinkable, food-friendly wine. That's because this wine's naturally tempered elegance means it won't overpower what you eat.

56884,US,"The winery has struggled with Pinot made from this warm, sunny highland appellation, which is more suitable for Zinfandel.

56894,US,"It's terribly hard to make an expensive, upscale Cab Franc that succeeds. The variety on its own tends toward cherry fruit simplicity.

56895,US,"You might think this was a big Pinot Noir, like a Santa Lucia Highlands, if you blind-tasted it.

56927,Italy,"This beautiful blend of Barbera and Dolcetto shows characteristics of both native grapes (although the Barbera component is an overwhelming 90%).

56928,US,"If you are looking for a right-on, pure and typical example of Washington Syrah, this is a good place to start.

56929,Italy,"Livia Fontana's Barolo from the Villero vineyard opens with a slightly aged appearance that sees brown and amber coloring.

56930,US,"At the age of four years, this Cab strikes you as very fruity and also sharp. It has jammy cherry, blackberry, black currant and baker's chocolate flavors that taste like they have a squirt of lime juice for tartness. The oak overlay is strong in char and vanilla, but balanced. The overall impression is of power and elegance, but immaturity.

Tastes good and comes across smooth and polished for Bonarda.",La Puerta Alta,87,15.0,Other,Famatina Valley,,Bonarda,Valle de la Puerta
57086,Greece,"Exotic pineapple and melon fruit aromas lead on this full-bodied white. On the palate, curvy melon and vanilla are punctuated by citrus and a spray of minerals. Assertive with body that can handle bigger flavors, like seafood, poultry and fruit.",,87,30.0,Peloponnese,,,Petroulianos,Vatistas
57087,Germany,"Part of Dr. Loosen's stable, this is a reasonably dry Riesling at a reasonable price. Petrichor and grapefruit lead the way, with hints of riper citrus fruits helping to round out the midpalate. Ends on notes of anise, crushed stone and citrus.",Dry,87,12.0,Pfalz,,,Riesling,Villa Wolf
57088,US,"Fragrant and soft, this wine carries a gentle floral fragrance—crushed roses—into a midpalate of bright raspberry and cherry. It turns a little leathery in the mouth, astringent but with the cherry flavors persisting, suggesting that further bottle age will soften it and add more textural complexity.",Guadalupe Vineyard,87,40.0,Oregon,Yamhill-Carlton District,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Soléna
57089,South Africa,"Foliage and black pepper adds complexity to the strong raspberry, red plum and strawberry characteristics of this wine.

57090,Australia,"The higher elevation of Victoria's Pyrenees imparts firmness to this wine's acids and tannins, suggesting another 2–3 years of cellaring. Right now, the wine's cherry-berry fruit and vanilla oak are still somewhat unintegrated but show promise for the near future.",,88,22.0,Victoria,Pyrenees,,Shiraz,Taltarni
57091,South Africa,"The nose of this friendly but soulful blend is packed with savory spice, dark berries and vanilla. Integrated pepper and spice and big berry flavors give it strength and finesse.

57092,Spain,"Clean and stylish, with hints of ginger ale and citrus on the nose. Good in terms of texture and flavors, with citrus and juicy nectarine working the palate.

57098,South Africa,"Soft, savory aromas of smoked meat and pepper typify this poised red from Stellenbosch. The elegant, integrated style marries spicy fruit and minerals in a gentle but ageable package.

57099,US,"Made from Yountville grapes and mainly stainless-steel fermented, with a little oak influence, this is quite a good wine.

57100,Spain,"Crisp as it should be, with fit aromas of apple, fresh lettuce and honey.

Quite satisfying and fairly serious given its under-$15 provenance.",Brut Nature,88,14.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
57101,US,"Fortress's Sauvignon Blanc, based on the Musque clone, is seriously good at a fair price, and now they've blended it with some Sémillon to produce this slightly sweet dessert wine.

57102,US,"Dry Creek's regular Cab can often be as good, or nearly so, as their more expensive bottlings, especially in a good vintage like 2005.

57104,France,"This big, ripe wine is now past its youth. That is bringing out the toast, yeast and walnut flavors.

57106,Spain,"Seems like the best wine under the Mercedes Eguren label. This Shiraz-Tempranillo blend is wholesome, ripe and rich. It starts with earth, leather and dark, herbal fruit aromas, which are backed by lip-smacking blackberry and mocha flavors. Shows agility and balance, but also brawn and guts. Drink now into 2010.",Mercedes Eguren,88,13.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Shiraz-Tempranillo,Bodegas Eguren
57107,Greece,"This blend of Merlot and native grape Xinomavro results in a spicy and savory nose of smoked meat and balsamic, and appealing flavors of dried herbs, sausage and spice.

57108,US,"Actually from a smallish block of a large vineyard in this rocky, cool part of Salinas Valley, this Pinot shows a silky structure, velvety tannins and crisp acids. The flavors are rich and savory, suggesting cherries, cola, vanilla, smoke and mint.",,88,35.0,California,Arroyo Seco,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Carmel Road
57109,Germany,"This is a broad, sweet, full-bodied dessert wine that lacks the crisp acids necessary for a higher degree of balance. Instead, it delivers intense honey and pineapple flavors that stick stubbornly to the palate. Probably best with sweet desserts.",Casteller Schlossberg Beerenauslese,88,169.0,Franken,,,Silvaner,Castell
57110,US,"Made in the modern Napa style, this Cab shows very ripe fruit, soft acids, buttery tannins and quite a bit of smoky new oak. The combination tastes like a blackberry and cherry pastry, with the sweet crust, but the finish is dry. Should do interesting things over the next six to eight years.",Estate,88,65.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tamber Bey
57111,Spain,"With aromatic touches of haystack and vanilla in addition to green apple and mineral, the nose is inviting.

Very nice for the price.",Brut Reserva,88,10.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
57112,US,"This is a new vineyard designation for Sineann, and stands out for its dark plum hue and its distinctly herbal nose. The scents are of herb and tomato leaf more than sweet fruit, but the flavors are Burgundian and earthy, with well-managed layering. Young vines, tough weather, yields tannins that are slightly grainy and taste again like clean earth.",Yates Conwill Vineyard,88,42.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Sineann
57113,Spain,"Lemon-lime, dry talc and mineral make for a clean, no-issues bouquet. This is a fruity, steely wine with pineapple, orange, green apple and lime flavors.

57114,US,"Quintessa's been on a roll the last several vintages, with the 2004 knocking it out of the park, but the '05 isn't quite in the same league. Hard to say why, except that production was higher than ever. The tannins leap out first, big and hard in the way of a young Cabernet, and immediate gratification is not what this wine is about. But it has impressive black currant flavors and needs time. Should be best after 2010. Tasted twice.",,88,135.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Quintessa
57115,US,"This is the first vintage for this spicy tasting room white. It's lightly spritzy, crisp and bone dry, with white pepper and tart citrus skin. The four grapes in the blend—Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling and Gewürztraminer—complement each other without losing their individuality. Persistent and very refreshing this  is a quintessential summer wine.",Meadow White Wine,88,16.0,Oregon,Oregon,Oregon Other,White Blend,Ross Andrew

57117,Spain,"A little bit round given that it's a blanc de blancs, with applesauce and spice on the nose. The palate deals a white-fruit mélange that's one part tangy and one part generous. Holds steady on the finish and doesn't show any warts or faults. Nice Cava with an elevated persona.",Blanc de Blancs Brut,88,16.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Paul Cheneau

57119,Italy,"Pine nut, molasses, caramel, maple syrup and warm wood tones characterize this amber-colored dessert wine made with Arneis.

57120,Australia,"This is a bold, full-flavored, authoritative example of Eden Valley Shiraz. Cool-climate notes of cracked pepper elegantly frame waves of blackberry fruit that are fresh and zingy, not cooked or confected. This is firmly structured and built for the cellar, yet the tannins are ripe, forming a silky web that supports the fruit on the prolonged finish. Drink 2012–2035.",Hill of Grace Vineyard,96,550.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,,Shiraz,Henschke
57121,US,"A sensational Pinot Noir for its complexity, ageability and sheer deliciousness. The parts haven't come together yet, but each is great. Smoky new oak dominates, closely followed by enormously ripe crushed cherry, blackberry, pomegranate, cola and mocha flavors. There's a rich tannin-acid structure, and the sweet, spicy oak reprises on the finish. This big, masculine wine needs time to come together. Should open by 2008 and increase in desirability for a number of years.",Les Galets,96,60.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Laetitia
57122,Australia,"There are approximately 1,000 cases of this wine, which blends 56% Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon with 44% Barossa Shiraz into a stunning combination of cassis and blackberries. Lifted bits of flowers on the nose resemble fine teas and dried herbs, adding the requisite complexity, while the mouthfeel artfully balances the weight of Shiraz with the structure of Cabernet. Mouthwatering and long, with fine, dusty tannins that bode well for aging. Drink 2014–2030.",Bin 60A,96,225.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz,Penfolds
57123,Australia,"The current release, 2003, is an excellent wine, but this vintage kicks it up a notch. It's brighter, fresher and more vibrant than its amply endowed precursor, bursting with peppery raspberries. Creamy and rich, yet wonderfully balanced, and while you could drink it now, it will also cellar well for 10-plus years.",Command,95,83.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Elderton
57124,Australia,"From a single vineyard in the Ebenezer region, this is simply stupendous stuff. It is a bit Port-like in its rich layers of blackberry fruit, but it also displays great freshness and drive, giving it a juicy, fresh fruit character that's accented even more by dustings of pepper and dried spices. A beautiful marriage of drinkability and ageability; drink now–2020.",Amon-Ra Unfiltered,95,80.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Glaetzer
57125,Australia,"From vines planted in 1893, this wine combines spicy complexity with size and ultraconcentrated fruit. It tips the scales at 16% alcohol, but wears it well, hiding it under hints of licorice and subtle wood spice and layers of blackberry and blueberry fruit. Yes, it's big, but it's not inelegant, finishing lush, long and spicy. Terrific stuff that should drink well from 2010–2020.",Old Bastard,95,140.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Kaesler
57126,US,"You don't think of Signorello as a Syrah house, but for years, they've been putting out serious Syrahs, and with the '05 vintage, they certify this tradition. This wine is, in a word, fabulous. It's enormously attractive in well-oaked cassis, plum, leather, cocoa and white pepper aromas and flavors, but that only begins to describe the complexity. The 4% Viognier seems responsible for the bright intrusion of citrusy acidity. As powerful as it is, the wine never loses sight of balance and elegance.",Estate,95,36.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,Signorello
57127,Australia,"Heady and superripe, this is a huge, mouthfilling wine that fits the ooze monster moniker, yet it finishes with structure and elegance.

Drink now–2025.",Alices,95,50.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Greenock Creek
57128,France,"The high proportion of Merlot in Pichon Lalande is a good reason why this wine, among the great wines of Pauillac, is always so seductive.

57129,US,"Chateau St. Jean continues to teach Chard wannabes how the game is played. This is a huge wine, but one of extraordinary finesse and interest.

57130,Australia,"Thought to be a blend of Shiraz, Grenache and Mourvèdre, although some of the older components could conceivably contain traces of other varieties. The average age of the components is 40 or 45 years, and the wine's color reflects that age, being amber at the center and fading to a greenish tinge at the rim. Toffee and coffee notes permeate the wine, which boasts lovely rounded edges, honey and a bit of dried apricot. Rich, with a long finish ending on lingering rancio notes.",Great Grandfather Rare Old Liqueur Tawny,95,70.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Penfolds
57131,Australia,"Unlike most of the Torbreck wines, this is single-vineyard Shiraz, cofermented with a small proportion of Viognier, then aged in barrels previously used for RunRig. Hints of apricot and bacon fat impart beautiful nuance to the blackberry fruit. This is slightly firmer than Torbreck's other reds, worth cellaring for five years or so, then drinking over the next 15.",Descendant,95,105.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz-Viognier,Torbreck
57132,Australia,"Shows a slightly lifted, peppery character on the nose, but also plenty of toasty oak and bold fruit.

57134,Australia,"The bulk of this year's Grange (77.5%) is from Barossa, with the remainder coming from McLaren Vale. It starts off with scents of maple syrup and lightly caramelized blackberries, plums and a hint of mocha, while on the palate it turns rich and creamy in texture with the bold fruit underscored by vanilla. There's plenty of power here, but it's restrained and tight. Give it until 2015 or so, after which it should last two decades or more.",Grange,95,250.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Shiraz,Penfolds
57135,US,"This is a very serious Pinot Noir, one that will benefit from cellaring despite the drink-me-now deliciousness. It's not just the fruit, which is deeply satisfying in cherries, raspberries, sweet rhubarb pie, blood oranges and juicy pomegranates. It's the structure. Crisp acids and silky tannins create a near-perfect architecture. Elegant and sophisticated, this wine should develop additional complexities for at least six years, with proper cellaring.",Arrendell Vineyard,95,75.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court
57136,Australia,"A terrific effort from two Barossa vineyards, one in Greenock and the other in Vinevale, this is wonderfully perfumed and floral on the nose, yet also peppery and fruity—in a word, complex. Ditto the flavors, which range from coffee to olive, chocolate to vanilla and berries to spice. All of these elements are tied together by a creamy, lush texture and a long, elegant and refined finish. Drink now–2020.",R Reserve,95,60.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Kilikanoon
57137,US,"Bright, saturated, and deeply colored, this poster child Merlot proves that there is no other place in the world that can do Merlot in this style. Magnificent in color, aroma, depth and texture; it is polished, elegant, firm and confident. Blossom, fruit, herb and barrel aromas are beautifully interwoven. The tightly packed fruit has it all, from red, blue and black berries on to cherry and cassis. The mid-palate, though quite full, is fleshy and tight. The acids are firm but not sour, the tannins fine and smooth and ripe. The finish, still young and compact, hints at an almost existential longevity.",,95,65.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Leonetti Cellar

It's so dry and elegant, with crisp acids providing a silky balance to the wealth of cherry, pomegranate, tea, cola, mushroom, spice and balsam flavors. Great now and should develop for at least six years.",Taylor Lane Vineyard,94,50.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Belle Glos
57139,US,"Though most Walla Walla vineyards got wiped out in 2004, Leonetti was able to keep its best Cabernet from the higher elevation sites. This reflects the tight, somewhat herbal aspect of the vintage, and is still showing a bit of a raw edge to the tannins. But the fruit is sweet and ripe, and the balance impeccable. The flavors mix fresh herb (basil, oregano) and tangy fruit (berry, cherry) with pleasing flashes of leaf and bark. The wine is nervy, compact and refined; the flavors linger and the aromas slowly unwind. This is a wine that I believe will age beautifully.",,94,75.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Leonetti Cellar
57140,Australia,"Owner/winemaker Peter Schulz has taken a little-known page from Hermitage, using a small amount of Marsanne to add a rich, glyceric mouthfeel to this impressively endowed wine.

Drink now–2020.",,94,48.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Turkey Flat
57141,Australia,"Quite possibly the best Octavius yet; features explosive Shiraz aromas of raspberries and peppery spice. Is the usual intense barrel treatment more restrained, or the fruit just that much more expressive? The texture is wonderfully lush and creamy, with an expansive mouthfeel and complex flavors of berries and spice that linger elegantly on the finish. Probably best from 2010–2020.",The Octavius,94,110.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Yalumba
57142,Australia,"A blend of 75% Shiraz and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is the rechristened Godolphin, renamed because of a trademark conflict.

Drink now–2020.",Oscar Semmler Single Vineyard Reserve,94,60.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Dutschke
57145,Australia,"Incredibly dark in color but light on its feet, this wine somehow manages to hide its 15.5% alcohol under fruit that's neither overblown or jammy. Spice- and herb-driven complexity is the order of the day, with scents of violets lending an exotic note to the aromas. It's mouthfilling and palate-coating but wonderfully balanced, picking up hints of black olive and espresso on the lingering finish.

57147,US,"The near-perfect marriage of acidity and fruit stars in this dramatically structured wine.

57149,Australia,"From an 85-year-old Mourvèdre vineyard in the Moppa subregion. The two years spent in new French oak is noticeable at this young stage, it should merge seamlessly with the dark fruit given a few years' time.

57152,US,"Lightly scented with melon, white peach and nectarines, this elegant Pinot Blanc has retained its bright acidity, wrapping it around the fresh, tangy fruit flavors.

57334,Argentina,"Initially it smells flat and earthy, with raisiny black fruit aromas. As it airs out it improves, but throughout its run it comes across heavy and wayward, with raisiny flavors and a simple dullness that prevents the wine from rising to the next level.

57414,Spain,"Clean and modest on the nose, with plump but standard apple and spice flavors. There isn't much unique or stirring about this wine, but it's flush and solid on the palate and fairly long on the finish. Perfectly good, with more yeast and size than most basic bruts. In addition, it's a little more pricey than the competition.",Brut Jove,87,17.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Gran Rigau
57415,US,"At the age of four this Cab is probably at its best. It's a good, solid wine, dry and full-bodied, offering true varietal character. The flavors of blackberries, currants and chocolate are wrapped into firm tannins.",Robbins Vineyard,87,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Croze
57416,Spain,"The bouquet provides plenty of kick as well as a hint of acacia. The palate is dry and full of green apple and nuts. Remains dry and seltzer-like on the finish, where light citrus fills any voids. Not overly flavorful or complex, but a solid white Rioja for near-term drinking.",Monopole,87,18.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Viura,CVNE
57417,Italy,"Here's a light and unassuming expression of Verduzzo Friulano (made as a dessert wine) with fragrant honey and floral notes on top of candied fruit, dried apricot and lavender. It's simple and clean and would pair well with biscotti or an easy fruit tart.",,87,11.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,,Verduzzo Friulano ,Colutta
57418,US,"You will not miss the wood on this unoaked wine. It's that rich all by itself. With crisp acidity and a stony minerality, it has flavors of Meyer lemons and limes, pink grapefruit and honeysuckle, and finishes thoroughly dry.",Griva,87,20.0,California,Arroyo Seco,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Bernardus
57419,US,"MacRostie's Merlots can sometimes seem like an afterthought, but they're generally good and sound, and so it is with the '05. Made mainly from the well-regarded Las Amigas vineyard in Carneros, it's dry, fairly tannic and rather oaky, and shows currant, anise, cocoa and cedar flavors.",,87,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,MacRostie
57420,US,"A 50-50 blend of Merlot and Malbec, this is the most expensive wine the chateau has ever produced, a commemoration of their 25th anniversary. It commands attention for dryness and complexity. The usual Bordeaux flavors of blackberries, plums and mocha are weaved into earthier tastes of salty, cured-olive tapenade and sweet miso, enhanced with smoky new oak. This is a very important release from the winery, one worthy of follow up.",Bravura,94,85.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Julien
57421,Australia,"Despite the name—this does exhibit gorgeous complexity and perfume—don't be fooled into thinking this shy or delicate. At 15% alcohol, it fills the mouth with layers of chocolate sauce and ripe berries, with hints of vanilla, cinnamon, stone fruit and violets. Finishes with silky tannins and lingering notes of fresh fruit and dried spices. Drink now–2020.",The Beauty,94,55.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Hentley Farm
57422,Australia,"Not far behind Kilikanoon's R Reserve—and, indeed, it comes from the same vineyards—the 2004 Testament is also a tour de force. There's a hint of rhubarb and spicy cinnamon that lends intrigue to the aromas of rich blackberry fruit, while the flavors seamlessly blend in hints of red raspberries and cracked pepper. Finishes long, crisp and mouthwatering. Drink now–2020.",Testament,94,40.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Kilikanoon
57423,US,"Fabulous Pinot, about as good as Carneros gets. Sourced from this famous vineyard, it's silky and complex in cherries, sassafras, cola, black raspberry tea, vanilla and cinnamon spices that change and intensify as they roll across the palate. For all that, the finish is dry and balanced in crisp acidity. With just 70 cases produced, it's worth a special search.",Hudson Vineyard,94,50.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Signorello
57424,Australia,"A blend of 80% Shiraz and 20% Cabernet, this rich, almost Port-like wine also shows a slight herbal note—enough to give it some lift and complexity. It's inky black in color, imbued with layers of dark fruit so deep they threaten to suck you in before being lightened ever so slightly by hints of vanilla and spice. Long and lush on the finish. Drink now–2015.",Godolphin,94,60.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon,Glaetzer
57425,Australia,"Perfumed on the nose, with hints of roses, pepper and game all adding complexity atop the base of berries and earth. This is wonderfully creamy in texture and crammed with lush fruit, but by no means is it what you'd dismissively call a fruit bomb, as there is considerable nuance to the flavors, ending on notes of pepper, meat and dried spices. Drink now–2020.",The Factor,94,105.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Torbreck
57426,Australia,"This superb wine features elements of cola, smoke and earth, but rising above all is the wonderfully pure raspberry fruit. Delicate in texture, with a long, silky finish, this is almost Burgundian in style, not a huge blockbuster, but a model of elegance and finesse. Drinks well now, but as a recent taste of the '96 showed, these are wines that can age 10 years past the vintage with ease.",Basket Press,94,,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Rockford
57427,Australia,"Despite a tough vintage, this is a lush, complete wine. Vanilla and cedar notes on the nose serve to accent the layers of intense—verging on syrupy—blackberry fruit. It's easy enough to drink now, but rich enough that you may want to hold it another couple of years. Just don't expect this one to age more than a decade.",Command,93,83.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Elderton
57428,Australia,"Incredibly perfumed, with peppery spice, vanilla, anise and blackberries all forming a wonderful whirlwind of aromas. Yet despite the complexity and obvious concentration, it's not heavy at all, delivering masses of flavor without excessive weight or obtrusive tannin. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy, the finish is long and spicy; in short, it's the complete package. Drink now–2017.",Australian Old Vine Collection,93,105.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Gibson's BarossaVale
57429,US,"This is from the winery's Annapolis vineyard. It's a very fine and interesting Pinot, showing the acidic, elegant structure of true coast Pinot, and exotic flavors of wild raspberries, red cherries, licorice, sweet leather, tea and Asian spices. All this, in a lightly silky, eminently drinkable texture.",Far Coast Vineyard,93,55.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court
57430,US,"This is Washington Cote Rôtie; smoky, meaty and dense. It is very tart, with cranberry fruit packed with dense layers of dried herbs and smoked meats. Extremely young, sharp, edgy and herbal, it needs a lot more time. But it's got the kind of organic, lightly funky detail that you see in Cayuse, the kind of detail that promises greatness in the future.",Boushey-McPherson Vineyard,93,38.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Bunnell Family Cellar
57431,Australia,"Big and bold, with an unmistakable hit of American oak—vanilla and dill—on the nose, but also huge levels of fruit concentration. Creamy, thick and mouthfilling, loaded with blackberries and spice. The long, robust finish suggests a certain amount of ageability, although this is certainly enjoyable now. Drink now–2015.",The Bogan,93,65.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Kaesler
57432,US,"Making a balanced, delicious Petite Sirah is hard anywhere, much less in a hot place like Paso Robles, but Filice has risen to the challenge. The wine shows Pet's huge, lush blackberry, boysenberry, plum and coffee fruit, complexed with dark chocolate and seasoned with Asian spices. Yet it remains dry and elegant. This is really great Petite Sirah.",Shell Creek Vineyard,93,26.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Petite Sirah,La Filice
57433,Portugal,"With its inky dark color, this is darkly dense, a huge mouthful of black fruits and dark, initially medicinal flavors and firm, concentrated tannins. It will age 20 years at least, but its sweet, ripe fruit suggest it could be drunk much earlier than that.",Vintage,93,115.0,Port,,,Port,Quinta do Noval
57434,Australia,"A lifted hint of mint on the nose comes from the Cabernet, while raspberry and spice come from the Shiraz. Both contribute to the full, complete mouthfeel and lush, creamy texture. The long finish displays some smoky barrel notes, but overall the wood here is well integrated. Should be a classic when it's released in 2008. Drink 2010–2020 or beyond.",The Signature,93,50.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz,Yalumba
57435,US,"Seascape is perhaps the winery's coldest vineyard, right in the path of the wind blast coming in off Bodega Bay. You can taste the Pacific chill in the high acidity that makes the fruit so pure and intense. The flavors, of Meyer lemons, lime zest and stony minerals, are bracing, and the finish is absolutely, thoroughly dry. This is a sommelier's dream of a Chardonnay.",Seascape Vineyard,93,60.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Hartford Court
57436,Australia,"Lush and creamy-textured, but not without structure. Although its blackberry and vanilla flavors are immediately approachable, this is worth decanting or aging several years, as it develops additional complexity over time, offering up hints of pepper, cinnamon and briary spice. Mouthwatering and long on the finish; drink now–2020.",The Eleventh Hour,93,42.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Massena
57437,Australia,"This could easily stand alongside the best Petite Sirahs from California. It's perfumed and floral on the nose, then adds palate-staining blueberries and hints of cedar, licorice and chocolate. The silky tannins on the finish are firm enough to suggest cellaring through 2010, and optimum drinking through 2020, possibly longer.",The Howling Dog,93,32.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Petite Sirah,Massena
57438,Australia,"A great vintage for Lehmann's top Shiraz, the 2001 Stonewell boasts incredibly dense, rich, chocolate-fudge-like aromas. This is extremely ripe and opulent without ever going over the edge. Balanced, lush and complete. Drink now–2015.",Stonewell,93,90.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Peter Lehmann
57439,Australia,"There's no doubt this is done in what some critics might call a fruit-bomb style. But boy is it gorgeously made. The creamy-smooth mouthfeel and lush layers of flavors effortlessly carry palate-saturating notes of licorice and plum. Long on the finish, with a surprising degree of elegance. A blend of various growers' fruit vinified by winemaker Troy Kalleske. Drink now–2015.",,93,30.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Pirathon
57440,Australia,"Two Hands' top-of-the-line Shiraz is a selection of the best barrels, boasting luscious vanilla and cedar from the oak, but also layers of raspberry and blackberry fruit. It's creamy, lush and vanilla-laden but elegant at the same time, with a long, slightly tart finish. Delicious now, but should age well through 2015.",Ares,93,150.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Two Hands
57441,Portugal,"Traditional here means that this is bottled unfiltered, giving it a good aging ability. Bottled in 1999, this is smooth and velvety in texture, showing signs of maturity. It has many of the complex flavors of a vintage Port.",Traditional Late Bottled Vintage,93,26.0,Port,,,Port,Warre's
57442,Portugal,"Don't let the medicinal aromas put you off because on the palate it is a hugely dense wine, concentrated, like dark, old toffee, with bitter coffee flavors. It's best taken in small quantities, savoring the richness and complexity.",Colheita,93,,Port,,,Port,Niepoort
57443,Spain,"Twenty months in oak has created coconut aromas to go with the ripe, sappy boysenberry scents that are draped on this studly, full-force RDD. The palate is a powder keg of massive blackberry, boysenberry and chocolate flavors, and the finish is like a retaining wall that keeps everything focused on the impressive midpalate. Great if you like 'em big. Imported by Fine Wines from Spain.",AlfaSpiga,93,54.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
57444,Australia,"A blend of several extremely old vineyard parcels, this features deep, intoxicating blackberry flavors offset by hints of toast and dried spices. Thick and rich, it rolls easily across the palate, yet remains surprisingly balanced and structured, not heavy or soft. From Carl Lindner, winemaker for Langmeil. Drink 2010–2020, possibly longer.",,93,105.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Barossa Old Vine Company
57445,US,"At about five years of age, this dramatic Merlot is just coming into its own, and there aren't many Merlots you can say that about. Its tannins are just beginning to melt. As that astringent tide recedes, a beach of pure cherries and blackberries emerges, deep and dry and spicy. Probably at its best now and for a year or two.",Reserve,93,90.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Merlot,Chateau St. Jean
57446,Australia,"Compared to Dutschke's top-of-line Oscar Semmler Reserve, this is a softer, almost pillowy style of Shiraz, luxurious in the way the tannins caress the palate.

Drink now–2015.",St. Jakobi Single Vineyard,93,40.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Dutschke
57447,US,"This is the first Stags Leap wine I've ever had from Martin Ray, who's been making Cabs from many other appellations for years. It's also one of the best Cabs the winery has ever produced. Exceptionally ripe and well-oaked to surround blackberry, blueberry, cherry and currant pie filling flavors, it's a softly beautiful, complex wine that's gorgeous now, and should age well for a decade.",Reserve,93,40.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Martin Ray
57448,US,"Showing the beautiful silkiness and delicacy that great Pinot should have, this one also combines immense power. The end result is an important wine of ageworthy proportions. Drinking it now rewards for the wealth of cherry, raspberry, cola, cinnamon spice and oak flavors that are so delicious. But the wine has a fine balance that will allow it to age gracefully for at least six years.",Hailey's Block,93,55.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court
57449,US,"Rich, creamy and lush, this is right up to the very high standard set by the rest of Novelty Hill's white wines. It's rare to taste an American Chardonnay with this mix of exotically ripe fruit, baking spices and crisp natural acids. It just hits every base square on, and takes its time rounding third and heading for a home plate finish. A very impressive effort.",Stillwater Creek Vineyard,93,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Novelty Hill
57450,US,"This is quite light, almost ephemeral, with tart raspberry and red licorice flavors and a strong metallic/mineral streak.

57452,Italy,"This seems very ripe, and offers notes of cooked cherry, backed by loads of exotic spice, cherry cola, prune, plum, crème de cassis and graphite.

57461,US,"Another lovely wine from Chaddsford, with both class and a delicate touch.

Pair this with more elegant French dishes with a seafood slant.",Miller Estate Vineyard,86,35.0,Pennsylvania,Pennsylvania,,Pinot Noir,Chaddsford

57466,Spain,"A lean and peppery style of Rioja that's very much from the old school.

Very young and fresh right now; it improves with patient airing.",Crianza,86,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Viña Salceda

57469,Spain,This Macabeo (Viura) blend is neutral on the nose but fairly big and bulky on the palate. Flavors of lemon-lime and banana are spritzy at first and then stickier late.

57473,Spain,"A powerful berry-based wine with no oak is what's on offer. The nose exudes rubber and leather at first, and then comes a wave of rambunctious black fruit.

57474,Spain,"Persistently murky and leafy on the nose, this traditional-style Rioja brings juicier, brighter fruit to the palate along with some tangy, somewhat sharp acids.

The silky texture and spicy finish make it irresistible.",Grand Detour,93,35.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Landmark
57482,US,"A beautiful Pinot Noir, lilting, refined and utterly delicious.

57658,US,"Sobon's Syrah is from one of the winery's oldest plantings, one that is organically farmed and lightly cropped. The resulting wine, which includes small percentages of Zinfandel (6%), the winery's specialty, as well as Petite Sirah (2%) and Grenache (2%), is more on the savory meat and cooked plums end of the Syrah spectrum, with a silky texture.

57748,Israel,"The opaque ruby color and heady oaky aromas of cocoa and toffee make this wine immediately inviting. Deep flavors of raspberries, cherries and blueberries emphasized by a touch of white pepper bring it all together, ending with a smooth, clean finish. Imported by Yarden Inc.",Yiron Kosher,86,24.0,Galilee,,,Syrah,Galil Mountain
57749,US,"The '06 vintage was kind to the winery's basic Sauvignon Blanc, providing a clean, crisp, dry white with flavors of lemon, lime, pineapple, nectarine and honey, and a zingy touch of tart gooseberry. Shows a complexity you don't usually find at this price.",,86,14.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Dry Creek Vineyard
57750,Australia,"Even though the vines were only planted in 1994, this is top-shelf stuff, dry grown, concentrated and intense. Bits of mint and licorice give dimension to the ripe blackberry and blueberry flavors, the mouthfeel is full and creamy and the finish turns dry and firm, showing solid structure. Approachable now, but probably best from 2010 to 2020.",The Reserve,93,,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Whistler
57751,Australia,"At this young age and only a couple of months after bottling, the French oak is showing a bit in the smoky, toasty aromas. But there's plenty of fruit to balance out the wood—plummy, fruitcake-like flavors that wash over the palate in creamy, lush waves. Mouthfilling and rich, with a supple, long finish; if it's a trifle less complex and structured than the 2004, it makes up for it in sheer lusciousness. Drink now–2015.",Platinum Label,93,85.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Wolf Blass
57752,Australia,"Practically roars from the glass with vanilla and spice, yet despite aging in mainly new French oak, the fruit flows forth in waves, adding cherries and blackberries to the mix. Creamy, lush and mouthfilling, this is a top-notch effort that may be drunk now and over the next 15 or more years.",RWT,93,82.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Penfolds
57753,Portugal,"Always  great, this is softer, less intense than in the past. But there is still great richness, and power as well as smoothness, burnt caramel blending well with the spirit, and finishing with its inimitable fresh acidity.",Duque de Bragança 20-Year-Old Tawny,93,70.0,Port,,,Port,Ferreira
57754,New Zealand,"Since its debut in 2003, this has been one of New Zealand's top Pinot Noirs, combining power, structure and complexity. Smoky and richly peppery at first, it turns more floral with aeration, and while it's big in the mouth, it's also silky in texture. The black cherry, plum, vanilla and spice flavors fan out on the long, layered finish. Drink now–2015.",Kupe,93,60.0,Martinborough,,,Pinot Noir,Escarpment
57755,Australia,"A terrific value, this boasts knockout aromas of blueberry pie and cracked pepper, followed by a velvety, rich texture and flavors that pick up hints of additional spice, grilled meat and black olive. It juxtaposes ripeness, texture and complexity to make a complete package worth cellaring until 2010 and drinking over the following 10 years.",Dry Bore,93,27.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Glen Eldon
57756,Australia,". Smoky and cedary on the nose, with hints of cured meat that accent the explosive red fruit flavors. The mouthfeel is creamy smooth, the tannins wonderfully supple but undeniably present, elegantly framing the lingering, spicy finish. Drink now–2020.",The Octavius,93,100.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Yalumba
57757,Australia,"Winemaker David Powell gets this Grenache from vines planted in 1901 in Seppeltsfield. Their concentrated fruit yields a black-cherry-scented wine that's broad and mouthfilling, yet kept focused by flavors of earth and spice. Picks up a touch of vanilla from the new French oak on the finish, but also ends with a luscious, velvety texture. Drink now–2012.",Les Amis,93,145.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Grenache,Torbreck
57758,Australia,"This has a distinctly spicy, savory, meaty quality to its aromas, possibly due to the one-third of the blend that comes from Eden Valley. Those elements impart great complexity to this wine, building on its core of blackberry fruit. Like all the Torbreck wines, this shows a rich, layered texture and a long finish. Drink now–2020.",The Struie,93,50.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Torbreck
57759,Australia,"Lush and chocolaty, yet also filled with layers of cherry fruit. Winemaker Stuart Bourne compares it to Cherry Ripe, an Australian candy bar similar to Mounds with cherry mixed into the coconut filling, and he's spot on. This starts off creamy-smooth, then develops a velvety edge of tannin on the long finish. Close in quality to the still-stunning 1998; drink now–2020. Imported by Pacific Wine Partners.",E&E; Black Pepper,93,90.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Barossa Valley Estate
57760,Australia,"Big and bold, like the excellent '04 version. If anything, it emphasizes the fruit even a bit more, with less spicy complexity, but it's a black hole of plum and blackberry fruit that explodes in the mouth, staining the palate with fruity intensity. The alcohol level must be elevated, but it's well concealed by supple tannins. Drink now–2015.",The Bogan,93,65.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Kaesler
57761,Spain,"This blend of six vineyards is great. It's dense and full of minerality, finely polished leather and pure berry aromas. The palate sings a melodious tune that begins with creamy oaky notes and expands to more defined plum, vanilla and fine herb flavors. The '04 Bembibre is a rounder, more complete version than the impressive but more austere 2002 (the last Bembibre we reviewed). It is immediately pleasing and keeps you on the hook to the end.",Bembibre,93,50.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Dominio de Tares
57762,Australia,"Smells almost Port-like, with expansive aromas of fruit cake, maple syrup and chocolate, then delivers a similar array of flavors, although completely dry. Full-bodied, lush and richly textured, this is almost too much, although the intriguing spice notes of cinnamon, clove and allspice help rein in the waves of chocolate and dried fruit. Long, velvety and slightly warm on the finish. Drink now–2015.",Apricot Block,93,55.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Greenock Creek
57763,Australia,"Shows the wonderfully silky side of Grenache—the main part of the blend—in its diaphanous, delicate texture that manages to be soft but not too soft, beautifully framing flavors of cherries, spice and cola. Long on the finish, trailing away slowly and elegantly. Drink now–2015.",Nine Popes,93,50.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Charles Melton
57764,Australia,"A standout Stonewell, the 1996 still appears to have a decade or more of life still ahead of it. Smoke and mint notes mark the slightly closed nose, then layers of wonderfully creamy black cherry fruit flow across the palate. Yet despite the lush mouthfeel, the wine still comes across as structured on the long finish. Drink now–2020.",Stonewell,93,75.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Peter Lehmann
57765,Australia,"Somehow winemaker Rolf Binder manages to combine cool, savory aspects with bold, ripe-fruit flavors. The 2005 Heysen marries cinnamon, clove and peppery spice with blackberries and plums, tying it all together with a robe of vanilla and chocolaty oak and finishing with a hint of espresso. This is a creamy, full-bodied wine whose fruit conceals considerable tannin; drink 2010–2020.",Heysen,93,45.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Rolf Binder
57766,Australia,"In the cool 2004 vintage, the nearly 100-year-old vines of Henschke's Mount Edelstone Vineyard have yielded a tart, crisp wine of considerable cellaring potential. The scents of pepper, blackberries and potpourri and flavors of vanilla and raspberries are buoyed by velvety tannins and a creamy mouthfeel, tightening up on the long finish. May not be as flashy as the 2003, but it may live longer. Drink 2012–2030.",Mount Edelstone Vineyard,92,100.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,,Shiraz,Henschke
57767,Portugal,"With its dark gold color, this fits the part of an aged, vintage-dated tawny even before tasting. It has great concentration, black raisin flavors, and hugely dense texture, leavened by an equally important layer of acidity. An impressive wine that leaves a very dry aftertaste.",Colheita,92,45.0,Port,,,Port,Cálem
57768,US,"Just luscious, such a good, complete wine. Perfectly structured, its intricate acid-tannin-oak architecture captures delicate cherry, plum, pomegranate and cola flavors. Not a power-packed ager, just a gorgeous Pinot to drink now.",Clark & Telephone Vineyard,92,38.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Belle Glos
57769,France,"Despite the hot 2003, this keeps an impressive sense of balance with dense rather than superripe fruit, herbs, black currant jelly and delicious touches of new wood. Structured to age, with dry tannins and acidity. A great success.",,92,36.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château de Pez
57770,Australia,"Full-throttle, obvious Barossa-style Shiraz, loaded with vanilla-scented oak, but also with blackberry fruit. The tannins are soft, imparting a wonderfully creamy texture and completely filling the mouth. Lush and oaky—this may not be for the intellectual wine drinker—but it's definitely hedonistic. Drink now–2012.",Boundary Row,92,27.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Kurtz Family
57771,Australia,"Creamy-textured, full-bodied and showing a bit of warmth, this is lush and lavishly oaked.

Likely to mature quickly; drink now–2012.",Moorooroo Limited Release,92,85.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Schild Estate
57772,Australia,"Nicely balanced, with subtle suede, cinnamon, plum and berry aromas and flavors. This is supple just to the point of being a bit creamy in the mouth, with a long, velvety finish. Approachable now, but should improve through at least 2012.",Bella's Garden,92,60.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Two Hands
57773,Australia,"A single-vineyard wine that contains about 85% Shiraz, 10% Mourvèdre and 5% Grenache, this is an incredibly concentrated wine. Slightly lifted aromas keep it from seeming heavy, but the flavors are dense and fudge-like, chocolaty and superripe. Dusty tannins on the finish suggest cellaring through 2010, and it should age well through at least 2020.",Exile,92,160.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,The Colonial Estate
57774,Italy,"You can taste the touch of consulting enologist Carlo Ferrini here: This is an opulent, modern and plush rendition of Chianti Classico with deep tones of cherry, vanilla and chocolate fudge. It's rich and plush in the mouth with velvety tannins and dark concentration.",Castello di Fonterutoli,92,50.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Mazzei
57775,Australia,"Even more spicy and meaty in nature than Gibson's Barossa bottling, this microcuvée—only 160 cases were bottled—highlights the savory side of Eden Valley Shiraz. Cola and blackberry flavors help round it out, but this is a slightly leaner style, albeit one that's complex and elegant. Drink 2009–2020.",Australian Old Vine Collection,92,105.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,,Shiraz,Gibson's BarossaVale
57776,US,"From the southern part of the valley, near Sebastopol, comes this young, juicy, crisp Pinot. It's marked by fruit. The freshly crushed flavors of ripe raspberries and cherries are enormously attractive, accented with toasty oak and Asian spices. But the wine has a youthful, acidic tightness that suggests aging. Best now, with decanting, and for six years.",Jennifer's,92,55.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court
57777,US,"Just about the most perfect Sonoma Zin from a typicity point of view.

The finish is richly dry and crisp.",Forgotten Vines,92,32.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
57778,Italy,"This is a bold, modern wine that confidently presents savory notes of plump cherry, toasted nut and mineral shadings that are well balanced and flawlessly integrated. Nor is the wine shy in the mouth, where it boasts black fruit flavors and a firm, tight composition.

57779,Australia,"This is a wonderfully lush blend. Dark earth and cola notes come from the Mourvèdre, spice from the Syrah and cherry and almond components from the Grenache.

57780,US,"Quite a bit lighter in body than MacPhail's other single-vineyard '06s, this one benefits from the elegant structure.

57781,US,"This is a half-bottle of Sauvignon Blanc grown in the Arroyo Seco, one of the best sources in California for crisp white wines. With residual sugar of 18.4%, it's very sweet, but it's not a sugar bomb. You'll find complex flavors of pineapples, apicots, vanilla custard, honey and crème brûlée, backed up with firm acidity that makes the wine finish clean.",Griva Vineyard Late Harvest,92,35.0,California,Arroyo Seco,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Pessagno
57782,Italy,"Very rich, opulent and ripe with oak-driven aromas of vanilla, chocolate, licorice and spice, this is a dark Riserva with loads of personality and almost impenetrable density. It imparts a smooth, silky feel thanks to the quality of its tannins and ends with a chewy bite of plump cherry.",Riserva Doccio a Matteo,92,,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Caparsa
57783,France,"A rich, creamy, sumptuous wine, with an impressive, decisive shaft of minerality and a stony, dense character.

57784,France,"You can tell this is going to be sweet by its gold color. And there's no deception, except along with that sweetness there is a surprising (and delightful) freshness, which comes from sweet apple juice acidity. The toffee is more obvious than the honey, but this remains a fresh, vivid wine.",Sélection de Grains Nobles,92,,Loire Valley,Coteaux du Layon,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine Philippe Delesvaux
57785,US,"With residual sugar of 22.4%, this dessert wine has fantastically sweet flavors of apricot jam, tangerine marmalade, gingersnap cookie, vanilla and crème brûlée, balanced with crisp acidity.

57786,US,"Right up there with the wonderful '05, Iron Horse's '06 shows the brisk acids and long hangtime flavors the wine is known for.

57787,US,"Showing the rustic tannins and peppery spices that Dry Creek Cabs usually possess, this Cab wants a little time in the cellar. With black currant, chocolate, tobacco and herb flavors, it's very close in quality to the winery's regular '05 Cab, with a little more concentration and a firmer tannin structure.",Estate,92,50.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Fritz
57788,Italy,"This is a lovely Riserva with thick and penetrating tones of cherry, spice and cola—the holy trinity of traditional Chianti Classico. The wine is dense, concentrated and intense without being too powerful or overwhelming. It would make an excellent companion to veal in a wine reduction sauce because of the natural succulence and structure.",Riserva,92,27.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Carpineto
57789,Portugal,"A big-hearted, fruity wine. With its ripe tannins and red berry fruits, this red is certainly powerful, but it manages to keep its balance, finishing ripe and sweet.

57790,US,"Pessagno has a perfect track record with this cool-climate vineyard, consisently producing Chards of this caliber.

Best after 2008.",Sleepy Hollow Vineyard,92,32.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Pessagno
57791,US,"Von Strasser has a good track record with this wine, and the '05 is right up there with the best, but be forewarned. It's very tannic. But then, it is from Diamond Mountain. Give it a good 4 years, at least, to throw some sediment and let the rich blackberry and black currant flavors emerge. Should hold well for 15 years.",Post Vineyard,92,75.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Von Strasser
57792,US,"Very hard in tannins, with a real lockdown astringency in the mouth, this is one for the cellar, and it's a slam dunk that age will reward it.

Best 2012–2018.",Rainin Vineyard,92,75.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Von Strasser
57793,US,"This is Baileyana's top Chardonnay, and the '06 defines what makes Edna Valley such a special place to grow it.

57795,France,"Certainly intense, dominated by dry botrytis, with the syrup element here in texture rather than taste. The wine has a great tension between richness and intense acidity, a wine with a potential of 15 years aging or more, but for the moment an intense glass of wine.",Nectar de Moncontour,91,45.0,Loire Valley,Vouvray,,Chenin Blanc,Château Moncontour
57796,France,"From volcanic soil, this ripe, but tight style of Muscadet is one that needs aging. Even after two years, the acidity has not completely molded round the fresh grapefruit flavors.

57799,US,"In a sea of mediocre Merlots, Longboard's '06 stands out.

57800,France,"Lapierre bottled two versions of this wine, one using no sulfur, one using some sulfur.

57801,Chile,"Balsam, lush prune and all sorts of earthy, interesting aromas set this rich, ripe Carmenère off on a wild ride.

57802,US,"There's something tight and minerally and acidic about this Chardonnay that will appeal to connoisseurs of austere wines. Even though the oak is nearly one-half new, the wine has a lean, lemony taste, with nuances of crème brûlée and roasted hazelnuts. Defines food-friendly elegance, and could develop bottle complexity over the next 5 years.",,91,35.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Merryvale
57803,South Africa,"An alluring nose of violets, berries and a touch of spice begins this stylish wine from Waterford. On the palate, flowers, spice and minerals unfold and mingle with elegance.

57804,Italy,"What sets this beautiful Riserva apart from the crowd is its delicate, ethereal and extremely harmonious nature.

57809,US,"With its black pepper aromas and dry, hard tannins that make the mouth pucker, this is an atypical Rutherford Cabernet. But it's a very good, even a noble one.

57814,Italy,"The Rizzi family of Barbaresco does amazing work with its specific vineyard crus.

Complex given the competition, but also smooth and very good by Chilean standards.",,89,16.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Quintay
57824,Italy,"Black notes of spice, plum and ripe prune emerge from the nose of this concentrated and rich expression of Barbera from Alba. The Serraboella interpretation puts a lot of emphasis on the freshness and overall quality of the fruit.",Serraboella,89,32.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Cigliuti
57825,US,"Three quarters Sauvignon Blanc and the rest Sémillon, this attractive white wine has an appealing snap to the fruit and an underlying acidity that sets it up in lively fashion. It's a food wine through and through, lightly toasty, with green berries and apples providing the clean fruit flavors. A fine value.",Snowflake White Wine,89,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,White Blend,Davenport Cellars
57826,US,"Pure Merlot, from the Red Mountain vineyard, this displays that AVA's stiff, hard-edged tannins, keeping the fruit pinned down into a compact core. Cassis and black cherry, iron filings and some tar are all carefully balanced. There's plenty of muscle for further aging, and a hint of heat in the finish.",Red Mountain Vineyard,89,45.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Fidelitas
57827,Italy,"Tettineive Barbaresco shows nice integration of wood and fruit. The wine offers elegance over intensity and although all the aromas are clean and correct, there is a slight point of dried dill or chopped herb in the background.",Tettineive,89,,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Antica Casa Vinicola Scarpa
57828,Italy,"This compact and lean Barolo Riserva opens with a light but luminous ruby color with amber highlights. The aromas here are elegant and ethereal with loads of menthol, balsam and root beer-like overtones. In the mouth, this is a particularly polished and silky wine.",Arione dell'Ulivo Riserva,89,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Gigi Rosso
57829,Austria,"Very mineral in character, this tastes of the stones of the steep Singerriedel vineyard. The wine shows tight texture—acidity along with green fruit flavors. The aftertaste brings out citrus freshness.",Singerriedel Federspiel,89,27.0,Wachau,,,Grüner Veltliner,Gritsch Mauritiushof
57830,Italy,"This is not your standard Moscato d'Asti. This sophisticated expression benefits from high density planting in the vineyard and the fruit is fermented in special French barrique for extra creaminess. On the nose, this sparkling dessert wine is redolent of apricot, pineapple and honey.",De Miranda,89,90.0,Piedmont,Moscato d'Asti,,Moscato,Contratto
57831,US,"Don't confuse this with the winery's regular Riesling, which is off-dry. This is their dry bottling, and it's a superior wine. Shows vital, crisp acidity that makes the mouth water, then follows up with rich citrus, green apple, Asian pear and peppery spice flavors that are tantalizing and complex. One of the more compelling dry Rieslings out there, but the 100-case production will make it hard to find.",Dry,89,18.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Riesling,Koehler
57832,Austria,"With a 10% barrel fermentation, this is a smooth Pinot Blanc. It has a luscious creamy texture, with pear, quince and green plum flavors. The ripe richness is well balanced with a fine layer of acidity.",Weissburgunder,89,19.0,Wagram-Donauland,,,Weissburgunder,Josef Ehmoser
57833,Italy,"An immediate and vertical delivery of cherry cola, spice and blackberry aromas makes this a very likeable Barbera d'Alba on first impact. Those good vibes continue to the mouth where the wine is dense, fresh and crisp.",Vigna Vigia,89,35.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Bricco Maiolica
57834,Italy,Here's an up-and-coming Langhe producer who has already made a big splash with the Italian wine press. Valgrande is the estate's most traditional Barbaresco aged in big oak casks. This vintage offers mature notes of wild berries and plum followed by elegant shadings of pipe tobacco and old spice. It shows medium persistency with drying tannins.,Valgrande,89,44.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Ca' del Baio

57836,US,"Hard to appreciate this pricey blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Malbec right now, it's so sharp and tannic and jammy. The big question is whether or not it will age. The signs are there. One of the winemakers, Kian Tavakoli, worked at Opus One. The grapes come from Beckstoffer, in Oakville. Based on that, you might want to give it a good six years in the cellar.",Jemma,89,79.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ellman Family
57837,Italy,"Elvio Cogno's Cascina Nuova Barolo is the darling of the 2006 vintage and Ravera, a more austere and reserved expression, is still something of an awkward teenager at this point. Mature berry tones and candied fruit come forward as do notes of cinnamon and Graham cracker. The finish is smooth and silky.",Ravera,89,69.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Elvio Cogno
57838,US,"Very dry and very crisp, with lime, lemongrass and mineral flavors. Considerable new French oak brings creamier notes, while 15% Viognier in the blend adds an exotic tang. It impresses for dry, zesty elegance. An interesting wine, and one to watch in future vintages.",7200 Vogelzang Vineyard,89,25.0,California,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Foxen
57839,US,"The Optu red is packaged in a supremely heavy, oversized glass bottle, suggesting that this is the winery's prestige blend, as does the name, Latin for “the best.” Big, full, rich, ripe, round, fleshy and forward, this is a no-wait red that should be consumed as soon as possible.",Optu Red Wine,89,40.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Fidelitas
57840,US,"A young, distinguished Cab, made in the modern style of softness, ripeness and apparent sweetness.

Should improve over the next 6-8 years.",Charlie's Patch,90,120.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Two Hands
57841,US,"High-toned, rich and dark, this blend of Columbia Valley vineyards has a spine of sharp herb and tannin, wrapped tightly in dark flavors of earth, coffee grounds, baking chocolate and black fruits.

57843,Chile,"The Medalla Real line now includes Carmenère. And this first effort is excellent. It has licorice, mint and ripe, balanced black fruit in all places, including the nose, mouth and finish. Around the edges, accents of cola, chocolate, olive and leather only add to its authenticity.

57844,France,"Made from selected old vines, Les Romains hints at the ancient Roman origins of the Sancerre vineyards.

57845,US,"A fine Zinfandel, rich and briary, with wild forest flavors of black and blue berries, Asian spices, tangerine zest and smoky sandalwood. Full-bodied and dry, it's nice now and for the next few years.",,90,18.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Zinfandel,Artezin
57846,New Zealand,"This vineyard designate was previously a major part of Kumeu River's estate blend and bears a close resemblance to that wine, yielding aromas of melon and citrus set off by understated oak. It's medium bodied, with a succulence to the fruit that leaves the mouth watering on the finish. Drink now–2012.",Hunting Hill,90,40.0,Kumeu,,,Chardonnay,Kumeu River
57847,Italy,"The nose is broad and penetrating with integrated mineral tones that stand at the back of plump fruit and exotic spice. This Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is a big, muscular wine with firm structure and polished tannins that would pair with cheesy chili rellenos.",Bellovedere,90,,Central Italy,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,,Montepulciano,La Valentina
57848,US,"This is deeply saturated, lush, scented with violets, raisins and chocolate, still tight and spicy. Excellent depth and structure, with about one quarter of the oak new. It needs some breathing time, and as it opens it shows more Rhône-like flavors of blood and shrubby herb.",Ceidleigh,90,29.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Efeste
57849,Chile,"Solid, juicy Cabernet that has a lot of fresh berry and black cherry on the nose. The mouth is forward and fruity, with slick plum, berry and cherry flavors. Not the most complex or layered Cab you'll find but it sure is good, thick and tasty. Powerful, too.",Hacedor de Mundos Reserva,90,25.0,Loncomilla Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gillmore
57850,South Africa,"This sophisticated red offers aromas of mocha, smoke and cinnamon spice, and flavors of blackberry, pepper and smoke in a smooth, rich package. Complex and unfolding, with ripe tannins and a lingering finish. Pair with lamb, beef or game.",Gravel Quarry,90,45.0,Paarl,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Glen Carlou
57851,South Africa,"Black currant, red berry, tobacco and spice give this robust wine a masculine edge. Luscious berry combined with savory spice and leather is backed by rich, sturdy tannins and a long, serious finish. Can age, but is excellent to drink now.",Lapa,90,37.0,Stellenbosch,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Guardian Peak
57852,Italy,Here's a unfiltered oak-aged Vermentino (it spends three years in wood) with a slight haze to its appearance and superrich aromas of mature fruit and honey. The wine is elegant and dense and will reward you with an unforgettable experience.,Santigaini,90,,Sicily & Sardinia,Isola dei Nuraghi,,Vermentino,Capichera
57853,New Zealand,"With 13 g/l residual sugar, this is a soft, off-dry style of Riesling that boasts admirable purity to its melon and lime flavors.

57859,US,"The Chelan region is Washington's newest AVA, but already showing great potential for Syrah, as this aromatic and explosively flavorful bottle proves. Ripe berries, plums and cherries are swept into a mix of smoke and rock and iron filings; as you taste through the wine there are citrusy acids and hints of resin and tar; it just keeps adding in the nuances.",Defiance Vineyard Estate,90,27.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Nefarious Cellars
57860,Italy,"Named after the Sardinian word for “plow,” S'arai is a blend of Cannonau, Carignano and Bovale (vinified separately and aged in oak) that offers a full palate of exotic spice and mature fruit.

57862,US,"A blend of three vineyards and three AVAs, this is a bit broader and fruity and seems less overtly chocolaty than the vineyard-designates from Fall Line. Pretty red fruit flavors are quite accessible, and the barrels lend a spicy top note.",Columbia Valley,89,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Fall Line
57863,France,"Characteristic almond paste and yellow fruit aromas lead to a fresh wine flavored with apples and custard. There is a tight edge of citrus, but this is a wonderfully fresh, accessible wine that relishes its open, nutty flavors.",,89,,Loire Valley,Anjou,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine de Montgilet
57864,France,"A floral wine, dominated by apple blossom and baked apple flavors. It may be dry, but it is deliciously soft, its fruits very forward at this stage, only just edged with a grapefruit acidity. A great moment to drink now, but it may well close down for the next few years.",Ph. Perdriaux Sec,89,14.0,Loire Valley,Vouvray,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine de Vaugondy

57866,Chile,"New World Cabernet Franc with none of France's leafiness but a whole lot of ribald black fruit. Maybe a touch more herbal and spicy than Gillmore's Cab Sauvignon; it has good depth, lots of fruit, sweetness and richness. Lip-smacking, tannic and a lot like Carmenère in terms of weight and herbal influence.",Hacedor de Mundos Reserva,89,25.0,Loncomilla Valley,,,Cabernet Franc,Gillmore

57868,US,"MCK stands for Motor City Kitty. The fruit has a sweet, plump character, ripe blackberries and black cherries, with soy and coffee streaks somewhat downplayed, though still evident.

57872,US,"This is a bigger and riper bottle all around than any other Columbia Crest Chardonnays. You get more power—big tropical fruit flavors and even more of the buttered popcorn character than defines the entire lineup—but the tradeoff is that there is less detail, more alcohol, and an over-riding simplicity that risks becoming boring. Grab the H3 if you want complexity; this bottle is for those who want the power.",Reserve,88,25.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Columbia Crest
57873,Italy,"Executed in a big, bold style, this Cabernet Franc (with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon) exhibits green notes of chopped herbs, spice, red currants and drying talc powder.

57875,Italy,"This vineyard-select is denser and richer than the estate's base Vino Nobile.

57877,Chile,"Haven't seen this unusual combination of grapes in quite some time, and you know what, it's much better now than when we last saw it in 2001. This vintage has a nice, almost magnetic nose, while the palate is firm and well structured, with cassis, black cherry, coffee and licorice flavors. It's a bit boring on the finish, but the mouthfeel and length are just fine. Fruity, rich and balanced. 325 cases made.",Unusual Cabernet-Shiraz-Zinfandel,88,50.0,Maipo Valley,,,Red Blend,TerraMater

57879,Chile,"A big, grapey bad boy with super richness but not much refinement or elegance. If size matters to you, then this may be your buddy. It's full of ribald boysenberry and cassis, and the feel is gritty and big. But it's short on touch, and overall it's more of an old-vines fruit bomb than a crafted, precise wine.",Orzada,88,20.0,Maule Valley,,,Carignan,Odfjell

57881,Italy,"Here's a steady, consistent Brunello that marches forward without exposing itself too much in terms of jamminess. It has aromas of ripe blueberry, black currant, prune and dried tobacco over a plush texture and good structure. Vines are 15-years-old on average and their deep roots may have helped protect against hot temperatures.",,88,,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,PianCornello
57882,Chile,"There's no shortage of hickory and cinnamon aromas, which are derived from the wine's copious oak. In the mouth, it's all about cassis, blackberry, cola and chocolate...that and a tiny hint of butter and vanilla. A little chewy and thick on the finish, with black pepper and carob.",Millantu,88,16.0,Maipo Valley,,,Red Blend,Santa Alicia
57883,Chile,"Kudos to Santa Rita for harnessing the inherent qualities of the '07 vintage and applying them to this very nice Carmenère. The wine is bold and loud, but controlled and balanced.

Drink now and over the next year or two.",Reserva,88,14.0,Rapel Valley,,,Carmenère,Santa Rita
57884,Chile,"Ruby-pink in color, with sweet aromas of cotton candy but also cherry, raspberry and strawberry. This is a departure from previous vintages of Cherub, which were drier and paler in color. This is more wild and ripe, but it's nicely textured and full-bodied as rosés go. Very good for Chile, but we like our rosés a little more subtle and less sweet.",Cherub Rosé of,88,19.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Syrah,Montes
57885,New Zealand,"The resemblance to Burgundy is more than coincidental: the soils are limestone-based, the clones are Dijon (667 and 777). The result is a light-bodied, elegant style of New World Pinot Noir, with flavors of cherries, delicate herbal twinings and almost floral notes. Drink now–2012.",Pioneer Block 4 Sawcut,88,25.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Saint Clair
57886,France,"Light wine, showing some citrus along with green fruit skin structure, this is balanced and crisp.

57887,Chile,"Intense on the nose, with a mixture of cassis and wild berry along with herbal notes inherent to the grape. The mouthfeel is big and fairly tannic, but it's structured and forward-leaning, with black plum, spice and olive flavors. A serious Carmenère for those who know and like the style; newcomers may find it slightly “green” and/or herbal.",Reserva,88,14.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Carmenère,Viu Manent
57888,US,"High in acidity, this single-vineyard Pinot stings the palate with tartness. Yet it's packed with rich currant, persimmon and Dr. Pepper flavors, and is dry and moderate in alcohol. Although this winery has little history, the wine may develop bottle elegance. Try after 2009.",Suacci Vineyard,88,49.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Zepaltas
57889,US,"There's a dusty, musty note to this wine that mutes it and doesn't blow off, even after a long time in the glass. The underlying Pinot seems fine.

57890,US,"Sommeliers, run, don't walk, to scoop this one up by the case. It's really good, a dry, softly balanced Cab that will back up food, not dominate it.

57893,Chile,"Clean and honest up front, with moderate richness and modest telltale Casablanca pineapple aromas. The plate is creamier than many wines in this price range, with flavors of apple cider, citrus and some pith.

57898,US,"A fine complement to Balboa's Merlot, the Cabernet shows a bit more muscle and concentration. Your enjoyment of the wine will depend upon your tolerance for flavors of stem and leaf, which run through the steely fruit and give it a Bordeaux-like sensibility. A fine steak wine, it finishes up with black olive and bitter chocolate.",,87,19.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Balboa
57899,US,"Barrel fermented in neutral French oak, with minimal lees stirring. This is very tart, lemon juice is the dominant flavor, with some sour peach/stone fruit character also. This might be a surprise winner with oysters; it's sharp and tart rather than fat or alcoholic—despite 14.7% listed alcohol. Tasting room exclusive.",Terroir Zephyr Ridge Vineyard,87,18.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Viognier,Hogue
57900,US,"Good, strong citrus fruit, wildflower and honey flavors in this wine, and powerful acidity too, like a squirt of lime juice. Some barrel influence shows up in creamy vanilla.

57901,Italy,Here's an older expression of Barbera from the Oltrepò Pavese region near Milan that shows shy complexity and sweet spice and pepper like notes. There is a prune and plum fruit component here that suggest the wine has held up nicely over the years (but probably won't last much longer). Drink now.,,87,,Lombardy,Oltrepò Pavese,,Barbera,Sant'Andrea

57996,Portugal,"Concentrated and dry, this shows good blackberry fruits to go along with the firm, dark tannins and ripe, juicy flavors. The fruit is rich, but not overtly sweet, more juiciness and acidity to go with the balancing spirit.",Late Bottled Vintage,87,19.0,Port,,,Port,Osborne
57997,Cyprus,"This elegant Cypriot white from the monastery of Chrysorroyiatissa offers a blend of complexity and freshness.

An intriguing white with class.",Ayios Andronicos,87,11.0,Cyprus,,,White Blend,Chrysorroyiatissa
57998,US,"Almost a repeat of the ‘05, in which the oak dominated everything else. Those waves of caramel and buttered toast taste good, and together with the pineapples and pears, give the wine an exotic taste of some creamy, spicy, honey-rich mashed fruit pudding.",Robert Young Vineyard,87,25.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Chateau St. Jean
57999,South Africa,"An earthy, smoked meat and plum nose leads into luscious berry and pepper flavors in this affordable Shiraz. Balanced acidity and fruit offer freshness and zest with dimension. The mouthfeel is full and pleasing. Pair with smoked meat or grilled spicy chicken.",,87,10.0,Western Cape,,,Shiraz,Blue Cove
58000,US,"The variety is Syrah, and the wine was aged in stainless steel. It's full-bodied for a blush and a little tannic, a bridge wine that connects white and red. There's a sappy, fresh quality to the raspberry purée and pepper flavors, and the finish is dry and spicy. Great with Provençal fare.",,87,24.0,California,California,California Other,Rosé,Azur

58002,Spain,"Citrusy on the nose, with just a hint of sulfuric burn and smoke. Flavors of sweet white grapefruit, tangerine and tarragon leaf give the palate that little bit extra, while the finish is smooth but short. Good but a touch flat on the back end and finish.",Cordon Negro Extra Dry,87,12.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
58003,US,"Robust in tannins, with crisp, fruity acidity, this Cab has very ripe, jammy blackberry and cherry flavors that have seen their share of smoky oak. It's a good wine but an edgy one.

58004,Spain,"Both Freixenet and its sister property Segura Viudas put out myriad Cavas in this price and quality range. This one shows cherry candy on the nose and some seltzer.

58009,US,"This is the personal project of Robert Mondavi's longtime winemaker, Genevieve Janssens, and her husband, Luc. Production is only 250 cases. The blend is of the two Cabs, Sauvignon and Franc. The quality of the tannins is perfect, and so is the effortless way the wine has absorbed 100% new French oak without the wood sticking out. My only criticism, and it's a big one, is excessive ripeness that makes it Port-like. The alcohol is 15.5%.",Limited Edition,87,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Portfolio
58010,Australia,"The Bull continues to offer reasonably good value, featuring bold fruit aromas and plenty of flavor intensity for the price.

58011,Italy,"This Sagrantino passito offers a thick, austere nose that is ripe with notes of blackberry pie, plum cake, Indian spice, bramble and delicate nut.

58017,US,"The debate over this Cab is if the fruit will outlast the tannins, which are fierce. The answer is yes.

58020,US,"This is something you're not likely to see every day—a 10-year-old sparkling wine made from 100% Pinot Gris.

58025,Israel,"Fairly young and needing some time to flesh out, this blend still has much to offer now.

58029,Italy,"As much as Tuscany and Syrah seem to be a match made in heaven, this wine is lower in overall intensity and rather neutral in aromas.

58032,US,"This is 100% Pinot Noir, tart and young and juicy, and at this price it's a pretty fair value.

58033,Spain,"A little baked and flat smelling, with licorice and stewed fruit aromas. Sounds kind of dark and heavy, right?

The structure is solid and firm and so are the polished tannins.",Riserva,92,30.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Villa Cafaggio
58052,Australia,"The inclusion of a large proportion of Eden Valley fruit gives this wonderfully complex aromas of cracked peppers and dried spices, which build upon a solid core of ripe blackberry fruit.

58053,Australia,"Despite a challenging year in the Barossa, especially for Cabernet, this is a charming, medium-bodied wine that should drink well for the next 8 years or so.

58055,Spain,"Very dark for Mencía, which indicates that it is an old-vines wine of pedigree. The nose is composed of cigar box, licorice gumdrop, balsam wood and berry fruit. In a word it's hedonistic, and the richness and full-bodied berry and plum flavors may just bowl you over. It's definitely more oaky than many, but it still qualifies as Bierzo at its most bountiful.",Tares P.3,92,90.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Dominio de Tares
58056,US,"Although this Cab is incredibly ripe and appealing in cassis, cherry, vanilla and almost white chocolate fudge flavors, somehow it manages to maintain balance and elegance.

From their mountain vineyard in Alexander Valley, the '06 shows tremendous balance, with an exciting tension between dry, minerally acidity and Viognier's exotic fruit and wildflower flavors. The wine was stainless-steel fermented and did not undergo malolactic fermentation, which helps account for the cleanliness.",T-T Vineyard,92,26.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Iron Horse

We're not in Napa Valley anymore, for the wine has a dried cherry herbaceousness and different tannin structure, but it defines the style that made Alexander Valley famous for Cabernet Sauvignon.

It has a weight and density that are almost Rhône-like, with flavors of mashed cherries and blackberries, mixed with cola and sprinkled with cinnamon, cocoa and star anise.

58062,Australia,"Behind some mint, eucalyptus and cedar aromas, this is a big, meaty Cabernet, with lots of flesh and power. The tight cassis fruit needs some time to unfold and the mouthdrying tannins need some time to resolve, but all the ingredients for future excellence are in place. Drink 2012–2020.

58067,Portugal,"A golden, glowing wine, very concentrated. The burnt vanilla and dark chocolate flavors are intense. Like many 40-year olds, this has just a hint of a medicinal character, suggesting (rightly) that it should be sipped rather than drunk.",40-Year-Old Tawny,92,130.0,Port,,,Port,Cálem
58068,Spain,"A swaggering, slightly traditional holdover from the amazing 2001 vintage. This wine delivers cumin, pepper, turned earth and vanilla-infused berry aromas in front of a juicy, forward, complex palate featuring prime red-berry flavors along with hints of red pepper flake and tobacco.

All that richness is perfectly balanced with crisp acidity.",Elevage Blanc,92,39.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Chimney Rock
58071,US,"This is quite a good Syrah from a small vineyard in the Oak Knoll area of the southern valley. Alcohol is very high (15.5%) but the wine wears it well due to the size of its fruit. Dried blackberries and pomegranates, sweet leather, violets and toasty new oak flavors comprise the flavors, and the finish is tannic and distinguished. This elegant wine is one to watch.",Crane Ranch Vineyard,92,36.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Syrah,Crane Brothers
58072,Australia,"A luscious Merlot-based blend, this is full-bodied, soft and rounded. Flavors build upon a base of coffee and black cherry or plum, then add hints of musk and cinnamon.

58075,US,"This is pure Cabernet planted in 1972. There is very little Cab in the country that old, and it's a thrill to taste it.

Drink now–2016.",Meshach,92,150.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Grant Burge
58080,Italy,There's a distinctive mineral aspect that sets this wine apart. Those aromas recall white stone or slate and enhance the wine's elegance and food pairing potential. The mouth is bright and ripe with red cherry and fresh berry notes on the close. It would pair well with braised meat.,Riserva Ducale Oro,91,,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Ruffino
58081,US,"This bottling continues to impress after all these years with its complexity and sheer deliciousness. The '06 shows charred barrel fermentation notes of pungent, smoky wood, but there's a great heart of citrus, melon and pepper spice flavors that makes the wine rich and rewarding. It's made even better by zesty acidity and a bone-dry finish.",La Petite Etoile,91,20.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Fumé Blanc,Chateau St. Jean
58082,France,"This is a big, concentrated wine, impressive for 2007. There are solid tannins, with additional great acidity, and plenty of structure and ripeness. Red plums give a finishing lift.",Les Vieux Granits,91,21.0,Beaujolais,Fleurie,,Gamay,Château du Chatelard
58083,France,"Intensely liquorous, this finely balanced wine shows considerable sweetness, but it is so delicate and understated. This makes it a great food wine. There is a suggestion of honey, while baked apple flavors are more apparent. And the layer of acidity keeps the wine fresh and racy.",Clos de la Guiberderie,91,,Loire Valley,Coteaux du Layon Saint Aubin,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine Philippe Delesvaux
58084,Australia,"Although this winery is better known for its Shiraz, I have been a consistent fan of its Riesling as well. The 2006 offers scents of powdered minerals and lime followed by flavors of apple and citrus. It's medium-bodied but muscular, with plenty of intensity that comes through on the long finish. Drink now–2016.",,91,21.0,Victoria,Victoria,,Riesling,Mount Langi Ghiran
58085,France,"Gamay often becomes more like Pinot Noir as it ages. That's true of this wine, which displays strawberry and spice flavors, as well as an element of minerality. The aftertaste has ripe blackberry jelly.",Cuvée Spéciale,91,22.0,Beaujolais,Fleurie,,Gamay,Domaine Chignard

Pure class throughout.",Gravity,91,65.0,Stellenbosch,,,Red Blend,Radford Dale
58087,US,"The 2004 was soft and immediately enjoyable. This '05 is tannic and better structured and needs some time. It displays a wealth of black cherry and currant flavors.

58088,Italy,"Deep concentration and color set the stage and are followed by warm tones of black cherry, spice, leather, molasses, maple syrup and tobacco.

58089,Australia,"A dark and hearty McLaren Vale Shiraz, with plenty of weight and tannin and concentrated cola, black olive and leather flavors.

58090,Australia,"A big (15.6% alcohol) wine, the 2006 Bella's Garden nevertheless comes across as balanced and drinkable in its youth, marrying a rich, creamy texture with mixed berry fruit and hints of mint and vanilla. Avoids any cooked character, finishing long and fresh. Drink now–2015.",Bella's Garden,91,60.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Two Hands
58091,New Zealand,"Better known for its Pinot Noir, Ata Rangi has turned in a fine performance with its 2007 Sauvignon Blanc.

58092,Italy,"This Riserva boasts a pretty ruby color and intense aromas of cherry, red fruit, almond and balsam notes of cola and Bengay.

58093,France,"Aged in wood, this cuvée is powerful, ripe and intense. The jellied red fruits are all sweet and rich, touched by acidity but mainly with good depth of flavor and structure.

58095,US,"Very sweet and delicious, a true Port-style wine that's high in acidity and packed with tannins. But the sugar level is so high, it makes the wine drinkable now. The flavors are of chocolate, red currants and vanilla.",10 Year Tawny,91,50.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Port,Pessagno
58096,France,"A full bodied, rich Pinot Noir, from a small 4-acre parcel, packed with solid tannins, bright, bitter cherry flavors and a definite high toast wood element. This is Vacheron's top red cuvée, and it does need several years to soften, open out and lose its raw wood edge.",Belle Dame,90,60.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Vacheron
58097,Italy,"Here's a fantastic wine with dense, well-extracted concentration (it's thick, but not impenetrable) and intense balsam aromas of cola and freshly herbs.

58100,Chile,"Cuvée Alexandre is one of Chile's best Merlots, and consistency is its main virtue. Every year it shows fine ripeness, weight and enough complexity to draw attention.

58102,US,"Opening with an enormous blast of black pepper, this wine shows a unique approach to Syrah. It's fully dry, with finely-honed tannins, and the blackberry and cherry flavors are joined with intriguing notes of ground beef, tamari, carob and violets. The vineyard is in the hills between central Mendocino and Anderson Valley, an area that probably deserves its own AVA.",Bells Echo Vineyard,90,22.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Syrah,Spot-On
58103,Italy,"This is an opulent, fruit-forward Riserva with plush notes of berry, spice and vanilla that add pretty shadings to the overall picture.

58104,US,"This is really a lovely Zin. It has the weight, tannic structure and complexity of a fine Napa Cabernet, but the flavors are all Zinfandel.

58109,US,"This is a worthy followup to the 2004. It's softly silky and dryly elegant, a creamy, complex wine with luscious red currant, cola, licorice and mocha flavors.

58110,US,"This is a lush wine, rich in fruit. It offers waves of cherries, blackberries, plums, cola, currants and licorice, and turns very spicy on the finish.

58111,Italy,"Here's a Riserva Barolo from the excellent 2004 vintage with elegant and traditional characteristics and evolved aromas of smoked meat, pressed fruit, chopped spice and moist earth.

58112,Chile,"Bold, dark, full and saucy, with aromas of plum and blackberry. Jammy but lively on the palate, with vanilla sweetness offsetting plum, blackberry, leather and savory notes. This is true Peumo Carignan with potency and blazing acidity. It's not as flavorful and complete as the 2006, but maybe it just needs another year or two in bottle.",Amplus Old Vine,89,30.0,Peumo,,,Carignan,Santa Ema
58113,US,"This is Syrah from the far northwest corner of the Columbia Valley, a cool region, whose wines show an underlying minerality. The berry flavors are subtle; this is a mélange of leaf, herb, rock and acid. Still young, the tannins are drying and the wine seems to be entering a dumb phase. Give it plenty of breathing time.",Rocky Mother Vineyard Estate,89,42.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Nefarious Cellars
58114,US,"There is a lovely balance to this Viognier, and a sense that these cool-climate grapes were not pushed too far. The winemaker, happily, chose to make the wine that the vineyard gave her. Delicate and layered, with paper-thin suggestions of citrus rind, grapefruit and white peach. Still tightly knit, this wine very slowly unwinds long after you've swallowed that first sip or two.",Defiance Vineyard,89,19.0,Washington,Lake Chelan,Columbia Valley,Viognier,Nefarious Cellars
58115,Chile,"A controlled opening is welcome, as are the soft, smooth aromas of tobacco, dark plum and warm earth. Full and generous in the mouth, with heft and balance.

58116,US,"A good 100% Cabernet, with complex, pleasant cherry, blackberry and oak flavors. Quite tannic now, with a sandpapery mouthfeel, and very full-bodied. Feels a little ponderous, but could be going through an awkward phase. Try again after 2013.",Collector's Reserve,89,120.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Martin Estate
58117,US,"Tastes a bit jammy sweet and direct now, with strong flavors of blackberries, cherries and raspberries. Seems to need a year or three in the cellar to let everything soften and integrate.

58120,US,"A Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend with 4% Syrah, this is an exuberantly fruity wine. It offers plenty of cherry, berry, licorice, cola and bacon flavors, with firm tannins.

58122,Chile,"Dark and charred, with aromas of shoe polish, asphalt, coconut and blackberry. It's masculine in style, with firm tannins that bite down in support of concentrated black fruit, chocolate and spice flavors.

58123,Chile,"Lively and a touch prickly, with strong aromas and flavors that properly reflect its Leyda roots. The nose is oceanic and sharp, while the palate is forward and tastes of lime and grapefruit. On the finish, notes of passionfruit and lychee are introduced. Tropical but true SB to drink as soon as possible.",,88,17.0,Leyda Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Arboleda
58124,Italy,"The 2005 vintage of this vineyard designate Nebbiolo scored an outstanding 94 points, but this edition of Barolo Vigna Rué doesn't quite live up to its predecessor.

58125,US,"A white Bordeaux blend of 56% Gamache vineyard Sauvignon Blanc and 44% Stillwater Creek Sémillon. This is sleek and spicy, with a fresh mouthfeel.

58126,US,"This is a heavy, full-bodied wine, with the weight of a Rhône variety, perhaps Grenache. Purists will criticize it for lacking the elegance you want in an expensive Pinot Noir. It's dry and tannic, with deep flavors of red currants, cherries, licorice, Canadian bacon and peppery spices. Could develop in the bottle, but it's risky.",Lone Oak Vineyard,88,55.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Firefly Night

58129,Chile,"Rooty and rich at first blush, with dark, black fruit aromas leading the charge. The palate is lively and snappy, with fleshy but short flavors of blackberry, cassis liqueur and coconut.

58130,Italy,"Cascina del Monastero's base Barolo shows simple fruit tones and offers an easy, straight shooter approach overall. You'll get aromas of wild berry, cola and spice and the wine is firm and compact on the close.

58132,US,"Held back for four years before release, this Zin has achieved a creamy softness.

Great value in a Zinfandel this likeable.",,88,18.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kunde
58133,Italy,"The overt ripeness of the fruit here presents a slight obstacle at first sniff. Once that is overcome, the wine offers a free range of blackberry, cassis, tar, leather and tobacco-like aromas. But, in the mouth you'll taste the jamminess and maturity of the fruit. It's a smooth, soft wine with a long strawberry fade.",Torriglione,88,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Mario Gagliasso
58134,US,"This new vintage of Consequence deftly mixes the strengths of each grape.

58135,France,"The Palmes d'Or rosé is always distinctive, not always for the good. However, this 2003 vintage shows well, with ripe cherry flavors, yeast and a soft, open texture.

58137,US,"Here's a solid, restaurant-style Cabernet that's dry and balanced enough to co-star with your food, rather than dominate it.

58140,Chile,"This is the first Cuvée Alexandre Carmenère from Lapostolle, and it has its merits. The only negative is a reduced bouquet of scrambled eggs that then dissipates to reveal nicer, more true berry and herb aromas.

58144,Australia,"This blend of Cabernet (54%) and Merlot (36%) also includes a bit of Shiraz (10%).

58163,Chile,"Very much a classic, high-quality Chilean Cabernet. The nose features traditional aromas of mint, tobacco, rubber band and herbs, but also deep black fruits. The acidity is right up to the max level, so the fruit flavors are pushed toward the red end of the spectrum, while accents of vanilla and dill are welcome. Some cola hints and heat work the finish, as do notes of black olive and cedar. One of Luis Felipe Edwards' best wines in years.",Doña Bernarda,89,29.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Red Blend,Luis Felipe Edwards
58164,Italy,"This inky Sagrantino di Montefalco opens with mature aromas of blackberry preserves and strawberry jam. You'll also get intense notes of spice, leather and tobacco but those overripe fruit notes still manage to stand in front. The mouth has firm, very astringent tannins and a sweet berry finish. Let the tannins soften with a few more years of bottle aging.",,89,45.0,Central Italy,Sagrantino di Montefalco,,Sagrantino,Madonna Alta

58174,Austria,"If only there was less wood here, the rich Syrah flavors might shine. But at this stage, the high level of toast smothers the rest of the wine.

It has weight, but the acidity is a definite element here, giving a vibrant edge and definition to the rich berry and plum fruits.",Reserva,92,,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Apegadas Quinta Velha
58250,US,"You should give this some time in the cellar, because right now, it's all about juicy primary raspberry and cherry fruit and sweet, smoky oak. Nothing's come together. We know that Pinot Noirs from these southerly, north-facing slopes of the valley yield wines of longevity, and this well-made, tart one, from such a well-regarded vineyard, should reward after 4–6 years.",The Ringneck La Encantada,92,50.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Armanino Family Cellars
58251,US,"Thoroughly delicious. This captures a distinctive side of the grape that blends a sweet grassy herbaceousness with a lively mix of apple, lemongrass, citrus and orange peel, finished with the slightest suggestion of honey.",,92,18.0,Washington,Snipes Mountain,Columbia Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Upland Estates
58252,US,"Very deeply flavored, with fine, ripe blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors, anchored with an earthy minerality. The finish is thoroughly dry. Yet it's also a very tannic wine, with a bracing, but fierce, mouthfeel that suggests time in the cellar. Better after 2013.",Napa Reserve,92,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,White Oak
58253,US,"Volume is what this Zin is all about. The vineyard is in the warmest part of the valley, and the grapes sure did get ripe. They flood the mouth with potent flavors of blackberries, cherries, licorice and red plums, with a peppery, briary quality and a finish so softly sweet, it's almost chocolaty. Just yummy.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,92,50.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
58254,US,"Although this is the least costly of the winery's Pinots, it's a lovely wine.

58255,US,"This Syrah is hard and tannic now, and it will always be hard and tannic, but it's quite an impressive wine. So dense and layered, it reveals tiers of complexity with every sip as it airs in the glass. The flavors are of pure, ripe wild blackberries, with currant, coffee and tobacco notes, and sprinkled with crushed black pepper. Drink now–2013.",Alexandria's Cuvée,92,69.0,California,Mount Veeder,Napa,Syrah,Spotted Owl
58256,Portugal,"Continuing the succession of fine wines from Aveleda's Quinta da Agueira in Bairrada, this is a powerful, firmly tannic but ultimately smooth wine. It has big ripe swathes of dark plums, figs and refreshing sweet acidity.",Follies,92,18.0,Bairrada,,,Touriga Nacional,Aveleda
58257,France,"An intensely mineral expression of Sauvignon Blanc, crisp, full of citrus flavors, deliciously fresh, but also complex. The wine is concentrated into a steel spring of ripeness, ready to burst from the glass.",Domaine Gérard Fiou,92,22.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Henri Bourgeois
58258,France,"A rounded wine, very green and opulent. Like many of the Fouassier wines, this needs time to breathe, as it gradually begins to show its intense currant, star fruit and green herbal character. Then the steel core comes through with a great burst of final acidity.",Les Romains,92,23.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Fouassier
58259,France,"Silex is the French name for the flint over limestone soil that occurs in the Sancerre and Pouilly regions. There is a definite character of tight texture in this wine, very mineral while it also has ripe fruit.

58261,Israel,"This deep violet-red blend offers aromas of black cherry, spearmint and freesia. A bright entry fades to tongue-coating tannins, with flavors of black cherry, menthol and orange zest.

58262,US,"Bursting with scents of watermelon sorbet on a warm summer day, this salmon-colored Grenache-Syrah-Mourvèdre pinkie hits the palate with peach and strawberry essence. It gives a brief impression of alcoholic heat before a buttery finish, in part due to the barrel fermentation. Unlike many rosés that are released right away, Oso Libre holds their richer style back for a while, allowing the layered flavors to properly integrate.",Rosalinda,88,26.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Rosé,Oso Libre
58263,US,"At this reasonable price, this wine is a great success. It's dry, crisp in acidity and creamy in texture, with pleasant orange, pineapple and apricot flavors.

58268,US,"Delicate raspberry and bramble notes waft from this unusual blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Pinot Noir.

58269,Argentina,"Char, sawdust and black cherry aromas confirm the wine's “oak cask” labeling. Full bodied and ripe, it conveys meaty thickness and bold flavors of berry and spiced plum. A toasty, charred finish is lifted by bright acidity and fresh black-fruit flavors. This will go well with just about anything off the grill.",Oak Cask,88,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Syrah,Trapiche
58270,Argentina,"In this easy-drinking wine, jammy aromas of multiple black fruits lead to a soft, simple palate with a streak of bracing tartaric acid.

58271,US,"Fresh and floral, it's invigorating on the nose and palate. While full bodied in structure with rich, round touches of waxy lemon peel, it's dry in style with crisp citrus acidity that lingers on the finish.",,88,20.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Pinot Blanc,Palmer
58272,US,"Alluring notes of pastry dough, spiced blackberry and strawberry-flavored fruit leather carry onto the succulent, medium- to full-bodied palate. Firm tannins bolster the wine's nutty herbal-tea flavor, and it concludes with a textured finish.",Dala,88,18.0,America,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arizona Stronghold
58273,Spain,"Heavy char and cedar aromas sit atop green-leaning black-fruit scents. This is tight, juicy, acidic and woody on the palate, with shallow black-fruit flavors that are largely covered by charred oak. A zesty, toasted and tangy finish is full of life but falls short on complexity and depth.",JME,88,25.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Graciano,Bodegas Muriel

Finishes moderately long with a touch of lemon-zest astringency.",,88,21.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Riesling,Jamesport
58277,New Zealand,"For a wine with such a large volume (over half a million cases were imported to the U.S.), the quality is admirable. Passion fruit and grapefruit elements dominate, while some grassier notes emerge as the wine sits in the glass, resulting in a pleasant blend of tropical and herbal notes. It's plump on the midpalate, then gains focus on the lengthy, mouthwatering finish.",,88,18.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Kim Crawford
58278,US,"The blend is almost equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, with some Carmenet and Petit Verdot blended in for complexity. The wine is easy to like now for its dryness and elegance, despite relatively high alcohol. It shows California ripeness of fruit, with a smooth integration of oak. If there's a criticism, it's excessive softness. Drink up.",Fog Catcher,88,58.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Red Blend,Niner

58281,Spain,"Rubber, cured meat and herbal berry aromas feed into a tomatoey palate with raw acidity and rough tannins. This features gritty flavors of berry and raisin, while the finish is a bit flat in feel and tastes of prune and stalky, roasted berries. Unlike many Ribera wines, this is earthy and not overly ripe.

58294,Portugal,"Keeping some freshness, but showing signs of dryness, this is a well-aged 10-year old, the wood acidity and spirit dominating the fruit. The aftertaste shows considerable age—more than 10 years.",10 Years Old Tawny,87,35.0,Port,,,Port,Rozes
58295,US,"The winery has been doing a great job with their Chard lately. It's a mountain wine and shows typical concentration, with very pure, ripe flavors of peaches, pears and pineapples.

58296,Spain,"Rubbery, meaty and fully ripe smelling: that's the nose on this round and dark Monastrell. Yet while it hints at being bold and burly, the palate is more restrained and subtle.

58299,US,"Babcock's Fathom seriously needs heat to ripen, and 2006 just didn't offer enough warmth. As a result, this Merlot and Petit Verdot blend has a stubbornly green, minty streak.

58300,Spain,"There's nothing not to like about this affordable Spanish bubbly. The nose is a little candied and shy, but it's pleasant overall.

58302,Spain,"Good but basic wine from southern Spain that shows cherry aromas with a citrusy twist.

58303,Spain,"Campo de Borja's “everyman's” red rides again in 2007. Sure, it's sweet and candied, but that's the 75% Garnacha talking. Flavors of berry, plum and chocolate are bold and forward, though not very complex. Seems more lush and heavy than in the past. Good for those who don't want to think much about what they're drinking.",,86,8.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Red Blend,Borsao
58304,Greece,"A touch of leathery spice adds to the juicy fruit aromas of this red from Crete. Flavors of soft, juicy berry and spice are balanced and offer depth.

58306,Greece,"This spicy blend of native grape Agiorgitiko and Cabernet offers a muscular nose of leather, tobacco and earthy dried herbs, and on the palate, cherry, leather and tobacco.

58313,Spain,"Slightly more chunky and dusty than lively, with dry apple aromas and not much else. The palate offers a medium level of intensity and flavors of melon, banana and white pepper. Turns drier and more soda-like on the finish. Good but a little short on flavor.",,86,17.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Dom Bardo
58314,Spain,"A little cloudy and minty, with aromas of herbs and reeds bumping up against cherry cough drop. That medicinal cherry flavor joins plum and light pepper, while the feel is lively, bracing and forward.

58315,Spain,"Stylistically speaking, this oak-aged wine is very different from all of Borsao's fruit-first Garnachas. And that isn't exactly a full-out compliment. So while the wine has balance and structure, the oak seems dominant on the nose and palate, which lends more vanilla and cream than spice and character.",Crianza Selección,86,16.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Red Blend,Borsao
58316,Spain,"Quintessential value wine from Spain is what you're getting with Viña Borgia's 100% Garnacha. The nose is candied for sure, but it settles to show the upside of Grenache rather than the weaker, more remedial side.

58319,US,"Age would be the salvation of this wine, because right now, it's pretty hard and tannic.

58321,Spain,"Interesting and unique blends get bonus points, but in the long run this conglomeration of indigenous grapes from Mallorca is a touch too resiny and bland to really deserve a call out.

58337,US,"Here's a solid everyday Zin, lusty and rustic, offering up a big gulp of fruity flavor. Blackberries, cherries, mulberries, root beer, licorice, and just about every spice you can name shows up. It's a dry, tannic wine that will love rich, fatty meats and cheeses.",,85,10.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Renwood
58338,US,"A bit unripe, with herb and mint flavors side by side with blackberry and cassis. Shows classic Napa mountain structure of tannins and acids, but the mint reprises on the sharp finish. Not an ager.",,85,50.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Merlot,Reverie

58340,Israel,"The 16 months in French oak come through with strong aromas and flavors of coffee, chocolate and roasted coconut accented by black cherry, dark berry and cassis.

58341,US,"Here's a pretty good white that you can have as an alternative to Chardonnay. It's creamy and full-bodied, with tangerine, peach custard and honeysuckle flavors. Could use greater acidity, because it's a little on the soft side.",,85,15.0,California,Paicines,Central Coast,Pinot Blanc,Donati

58344,Portugal,"Normally grown in the Dão region, this grape needs poor soil to flourish. On its own, it makes a powerfully fruity wine packed with red fruits and some flavors of dark chocolate.

58349,Spain,"Clean, wet, a bit sweet and rather formulaic, this Verdejo has a soft, chummy personality and seemingly more than a dash of residual sugar.

58350,US,"This is the winery's Pauillac-style wine, almost entirely Cab. It's a very good wine, close to a great one. Shows real varietal character with intense cassis aromas and flavors, accented by plenty of oak. The tannins are similar to a Sonoma mountain Cab, firm, dry and dusty, suggesting ageworthiness. Best now through 2012.",Cuvée Pau,92,50.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,J. Lohr
58351,US,"Polished and sophisticated Chard, easy to like for its dry crispness, and the way the bright acidity perks up the tropical fruit and mineral flavors.

58352,US,"Very fine and rich, especially the texture, which is as velvety smooth as Napa Cab gets. The tannins are a wonder, perfectly ripe and soft, which gives the wine a feminine mouthfeel. But the oak and fruit are pure power. This is supple and rich, but somehow, it doesn't seem like an ager.

58353,US,"You'll want to give this pretty Pinot some time in the bottle, to let it mellow out. Right now, it's a big-boned wine, with flamboyant raspberry, cherry and sassafras flavors of the pie-filling kind, and a smoky, vanilla edge of oak. Despite the volume, the wine is dry and elegant, with a rich scour of cleansing acidity. Best after winter 2007.",Fritschen Vineyard,92,54.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
58354,Australia,"Although it's not indicated on the front label, this is 100% Shiraz, sourced from 60-year-old vines in the Ebenezer district and 90-year-old vines near Gomersal. It's Teusner's best wine, loaded with spice and savory notes that perfectly highlight the rich blackberry fruit. Not jammy or overblown, it has enough structure to suggest a drinking window from 2010–2020.",Albert,92,60.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Teusner
58355,US,"There's a succulent richness to this Burgundian-inspired Chard that makes it delicious.

58356,US,"Former Tolosa winemaker Ed Filice is off to a good start with his own brand.

58357,Australia,"Tight and oaky at first, but this gradually opens with air to reveal copious blueberry and blackberry aromas and flavors. Vanilla and spice accent the primary fruit, while the tannins are supple, imparting a creamy mouthfeel. Long on the finish. Despite its youthful drinkability, this wine should age through at least 2015.",Entity,92,40.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,John Duval Wines
58358,Spain,"With each vintage this bruising Toro gets more comfortable and familiar. Yes, it's still a tannic behemoth with a ton of new oak, but under all that bluster there's wonderful Tinta de Toro blackberry, licorice and tobacco flavors. And the finish of mocha and more is better than any visit to Starbucks. Hold until 2009.",,92,73.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Campo Eliseo
58359,Australia,"Past vintages of Elderton wines have been heavily oaked, and this wine is no exception—plenty of cedary, vanilla-laden aromas burst from the glass. But they're well balanced by crisp cassis flavors that turn chocolaty on the finish, where they also pick up a hint of tobacco. Delicious now, but it should drink well until at least 2014.",Ashmead Single Vineyard,92,79.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Elderton
58360,New Zealand,"Villa Maria's single-vineyard wines are usuallly incredibly expressive, and this flashy Chardonnay from Hawke's Bay is no exception. Bold nectarine and citrus notes are skillfully framed by toasty oak. There's a woody wallop here, but also plenty of fruit, and rather than being heavy, it finishes long and fresh. Delicious now, so there's no need to defer gratification.",Waikahu Vineyard,92,35.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Chardonnay,Villa Maria
58361,New Zealand,"This is a wonderfully expressive NZ SAuvignon Blanc, oozing with tropical fruit, but with greenish overtones of fresh herbs and tomato leaves. Bold passion fruit rules the nose, with the herbal notes providing balance. Medium- to full-bodied, with a long finish, this should drink well over the next year or so.",Taylors Pass Vineyard,92,32.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Villa Maria
58362,US,"A very fashionable Sauvignon Blanc. It takes the basic architecture of crisp acidity and dry, spicy citrus and fig fruit and boosts it to levels of true elegance and sophistication.

58363,Australia,"This is prototypical Barossa Valley Shiraz, boasting a big, lush mouthfeel and great depth of ripe fruit.

Drink now–2015.",Rossco's,92,47.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Steve Hoff
58364,Australia,"In contrast to many of the Barossa's Grenache-dominant blends, this is not a punchy, fruity, glug-it-down style. In fact, the operative word here is delicate, referring to the intricate interplay of spice, tea, herbs, rose petals and red cherries on the nose and the silky tannins on the palate. Drink now–2015, and serve it with some of the same dishes you might pair with Pinot Noir, such as veal or poultry.",Moppa Springs G-M-S,92,,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Rockford
58365,Spain,"This small-production, ultraexpressive Bierzo features dynamite structure and intensity, a clear reflection of old vines grown at altitude. The nose exudes minerality and dense black fruit along with a good whack of fine French oak. The palate runs for miles while distributing warmth, richness, chocolate, minerality and length. Already drinking well but will age nicely for another three to five years.",,92,80.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Paixar
58366,Australia,"Much more intense than Yalumba's Bush Vine bottling, this is almost resiny at times, with a sinewy, herbal note imparting strength and complexity to the lush raspberry-vanilla flavors. From vines planted in 1889, this finishes long, peppery and herbal, a fitting counterpoint to the creamy texture and soft tannins. Drink now–2012.",Hand Picked Tricentenary Vines,92,30.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Grenache,Yalumba

58368,US,"This is 100% Syrah, delicious, fragrant and loaded with spice. It's a blend from several different Washington AVAs, and has just the right mix of citrus, pepper, smoke, spice, acid, toast and tannin, bringing in elements from all of them. The fruit is sweet and brambly; the herbal elements are just right, adding notes of leaf and tobacco. There is a whiff of smoke and bacon fat, and the citrus/acid component lifts it nicely.",,91,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Forgeron
58369,Australia,"An immensely aromatic expression of Barossa Shiraz, with bold notes of menthol, raspberries, chocolate and spice all bursting forth. The flavors are similar, and similarly expressive, although this wine lacks some of the richness of texture found in Greenock Creek's 2004 Alices or Apricot Block Shirazes.

58370,Spain,"It seems that all of Monsieur Magrez's new wines from around the world have a similar DNA: size, ripeness, plenty of new oak and ultimately quality.

Imported by Bernard Magrez.",Paciencia,91,75.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tempranillo,Bernard Magrez
58371,Spain,"From what will go down as a legendary vintage, the '01 Lanciano is a full-boned but elegant wine with deftly balanced aromas of chocolate, mint, graphite and berry compote.

58373,Spain,"Some early gas and sulfuric aromas blow off from the nose, leaving meaty berry scents. This wine sports a natural personality; it mixes leather and herb notes with polished but not overdone berry and plum flavors. And the finish is rich with molasses and leather.

58376,Spain,"This is truly a unique wine in the sense that hardly any Verdejos are fermented in oak. Not only that, the end result is stellar. There's soft buttercup aromas leading into a layered, vanilla-edged palate of spiced apple, melon and greens. The wine is round, substantive and it stirs interest. And for that we're grateful. Drink now through 2008.",José Pariente - Fermentado en Barrica,91,31.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Dos Victorias
58377,US,"Spicy, sharp and tight, this is packed with compact herbs, spicy fruit, smoke and black tar. Tannins remain sharp-edged and a bit unforgiving for now.

Definitely needs more time.",Clifton Hill Vineyard,91,38.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Bunnell Family Cellar

58379,Australia,"Only the second vintage of this wine, which sits above The Holy Trinity in the Grant Burge hierarchy. The 2003 is a blend of 36% Mataro, 33% Grenache and 31% Shiraz, showing hints of tea and cola on the nose to go with dark blackberry and coffee flavors. This is crisp and well-structured, with some drying tannins on the finish that suggest short-term cellaring. Drink 2010–2018.",Abednego,91,,South Australia,Barossa,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Grant Burge
58380,Italy,"Here's a fruity, cheerful wine that boasts a luminous golden color and enticing notes of honey-coated almonds, crusty crème brûlée, almond amaretto and a twist of orange zest.

58383,South Africa,"A taut but expressive nose of minerals, pepper and red fruit lead this lovely wine from Stellensbosch.

A beautiful wine with ageable appeal.",Cobblers Hill,90,38.0,Stellenbosch,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Jardin
58384,Chile,"A touch heavy and medicinal on the nose, but it isn't reduced or dull, and with airing it settles into a nice place. It's mildly herbal, which is typical for Chile. But it's also smooth on the palate, with a long finish of chocolate and spice. If eucalyptus is your thing this will definitely be a pleaser.",Cima Limited Edition,90,50.0,Aconcagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Porta
58385,US,"This bottling has been remarkably consistent over the last several vintages. Always exotic in lemondrop-candy fruit that's been well-oaked, it has nuances of flower petals, white peaches, minerals and honey. The '06 may be a little softer than past vintages.",Hawk Hill Vineyard,90,50.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
58386,Italy,"There's great personality here thanks to the wine's bright fruit flavors, vibrant color and penetrating balsam notes that add depth and dimension. Bright cherry, blueberry, vanilla, sweet almond and menthol notes color a wine that will definitely pair beautifully with lamb, beef and most pasta dishes. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied but firm and showcases the pure fruit characteristics of Sangiovese.",Riserva Montegiachi,90,,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Agricoltori del Chianti Geografico
58387,US,"This is an interesting and different wine. It's much lower in alcohol than most Cabs, but completely dry, with a tobacco and sage pull to the black currant flavors. The firm tannins suggest cellar possibilities.",Hyde Vineyard,90,60.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bonneau

58389,US,"There's a tight, muted quality to this wine. While it floods the mouth with cherry, raspberry, Dr. Pepper and cocoa flavors, the acids and tannins are Burgundian, suggesting ageability.

58390,Australia,"Marlargo appears to be a reasonably successful attempt at fashioning a pan-Australian brand, sourcing fruit from different parts of the country. This Clare Riesling starts with scents of talcum powder and lime sherbet, then follows those up with similar flavors. It's muscular and taut, even a bit austere, clocking in at only 11.4% alcohol. May develop through 2015.",Bolero,90,16.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,,Riesling,Marlargo
58391,Italy,"Here is a lusciously modern Sangiovese (with small percentages of Malvasia Nera, Colorino and Merlot) with thick concentration and many layers of penetrating aromas that include ripe cherry, leather, tobacco, spice and vibrant forest fruit.

58392,Australia,"The color is dark and dense and so are the aromas, which show plenty of vanilla oak and mulberry fruit. As you might expect from winemaker Ben Glaetzer and the Mitolo family, this is a full-bodied Shiraz, albeit not quite as lush and riveting as the 2005 version. The tannins this year are soft, the acids a bit on the tart side, giving the fruit a crisp edge. Probable drinking window: 2010–2020.",Savitar,90,66.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Mitolo
58393,Australia,"Daryl Groom has turned out a reasonably bold, intense Sauvignon Blanc that weighs in under 13% alcohol yet manages to avoid tasting malnourished or underripe.

58395,US,"What a great Pinot Gris. Barrel-fermented, it shows a toasty, creamy smokiness to the citrus, nectarine, fig and vanilla flavors, with that Edna Valley acidity that's so clean and refreshing. Absolutely delicious, it's rich and substantial enough to stand in as an interesting alternative to Chardonnay.",Chamisal Vineyards,90,24.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Gris,Domaine Alfred
58396,New Zealand,"A nicely balanced barrel-aged Chard, this wine offers scents of toasted hazelnuts, vanilla and citrus, then builds on those flavors by adding broader peach notes.

58397,US,"Pale in color but powerful in flavor, this Pinot is perfumed in cherry, cola, rose petal, roasted cedar wood and pepper aromas, with similar flavors.

58399,South Africa,"A nose of spicy, jammy, balanced fruit leads on this exemplary Pinotage from Neil Ellis.

All the hallmarks of Pinotage with a classy edge.",,90,19.0,Stellenbosch,,,Pinotage,Neil Ellis
58400,Portugal,"Taking the idea of its name from Sauternes producers, the second wine from Romaneira is rich, succulent and fruity.

58402,Italy,"This is an elegant wine with measured but well-dosed aromas of cherry fruit, leather, tobacco and spice.

58403,Italy,"This is an extremely well balanced Riserva (with 15% Merlot in the blend) that plays with various elements—fruit, toast and mineral—extremely well.

58404,South Africa,"Lynx never seems to miss the mark, producing exquisite wines with unique character.

Restrained but flavorful, it's an excellent food pairing choice.",,90,20.0,Franschhoek,,,Shiraz,Lynx
58405,Chile,"Priced just above the Best Buy level, Quatro is still a great value. MontGras brings Cabernet, Malbec, Carmenère and Syrah together in a well-meshed way.

It has some woody characteristics, but mostly it's harmonious as it builds to a nice finish of mocha and fine tannins.",Quatro,90,16.0,Central Valley,,,Red Blend,MontGras
58406,Australia,"A little less austere and easier to drink than many dry Aussie Rieslings, this wine features lime and vanilla shadings on the nose, and ample apple, melon and citrus flavors.

58408,US,"Reminiscent of the 2000, this wine has a crisp, linear character that emphasizes minerals rather than the overt tropical fruits the vineyard shows in warmer vintages.

58410,US,"A bit of a letdown after a string of riper, more successful vintages. Feels sharp and somewhat herbal, with a hay or dried wheat edge to the black cherry and rhubarb fruit. Could just be going through a tough period, and might emerge on the other side in 5–6 years.",Niclaire,88,75.0,California,California,California Other,Pinot Noir,Testarossa

58413,US,"From the Evergreen Vineyard, in the Ancient Lakes region north of the Wahluke Slope, this is surprisingly high-powered, at 13.9% alcohol, with a big smack of oak in the nose.

58416,US,"Smooth, ripe, and scented with a mix of raisins, cherry compote and baking spices, this forward, fruity Cabernet Sauvignon reaches almost 15% alcohol.

58418,US,"Sweet oak and lightly tropical fruit flavors characterize this young, tight, full-bodied Chardonnay. With another year or two in bottle, the fruit should emerge from behind the new oak flavors and enhance the overall balance. In the meanwhile, decanting is a good idea.",Connor Lee Vineyard,88,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Arbor Crest
58419,Italy,"This Roero offers very good intensity of aromas that are characterized by layers of white cherry, wild berry and exotic spice.

58421,Chile,"Always one of Chile's more oaky Chards, Amelia offers popcorn, toast, minerality and peach/apricot aromas.

58422,Chile,"Nice and aromatic, with cola, tobacco, fallen dried leaves and dark fruits. The palate has some scratch and acidity to it, but the flavors are good and lively, with a focus on dark plum and cherry. A bit more acidic than I like, but still healthy and very nice for varietal Carmenère.",Marques de Casa Concha,88,22.0,Peumo,,,Carmenère,Concha y Toro
58423,Italy,"Due to its older age, this is a difficult wine to evaluate. Barbera is usually released young and fresh and is intended as a companion to pizza, pasta and other easy foods. This wine, on the other hand, shows sophisticated aromas of dried currant, leather, cola and spice.",Stradivario,88,68.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,,Barbera,Bava
58424,France,"Already a touch toasty, this is not as searingly dry as some Zéro Dosage Champagnes.

In the end, though, it has weight along with lively acidity.",Topaze Zéro Dosage,88,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Louis Barthélémy

58429,US,"Tight and nicely constructed, this is not afraid to show its herbal side.

58430,US,"This new Malbec is a soft, fruity, extremely dark wine, with scents of raisins and pretty fruit flavors of boysenberries and black cherries, with lighter streaks of coffee and caramel woven through.

58433,US,"A very nice Sauvignon Blanc that shows the grassy, herbaceous edge that Dry Creek brings to so many wines. But that doesn't mean it's thin. On the contrary, it offers a rich mouth burst of citrus and tropical fruits, figs and green melons, with a touch of tart gooseberry. The finish is a little sweet in honey.",Stetson Greene Vineyard,88,20.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Paradise Ridge

58438,France,"A richer version of a Saumur sparkling wine, this is soft, ripe and creamy. The dosage feels on the sweet side, although it is labeled Brut.

Production was 21,000 cases.",Domino,88,7.0,California,California,California Other,Pinot Grigio,Delicato
58440,Australia,"As you might surmise from the name, Merlot plays a dominant role in this reasonably priced blend from Western Australia.

58454,Chile,"Perfectly ripe, with hints of raisin, licorice and blackberry on the nose. So mature and ready that it has sweetness, but it's natural and offset by a backbone of fine tannins.

58462,US,"This is 100% varietal and, most unusually for Klipsun, finished at just 13.2% alcohol.

58464,US,"Sourced from McClellan Estate vineyard, this excellent effort is balanced and juicy, bursting with boysenberry and cassis.

58467,Chile,"A snappy, ageworthy Carignan from 58-year-old vines. Fresh as can be, with dynamic red-fruit flavors coming on top of earthy, mineral-laden aromas.

This is not a wine that tries to seduce you; it's for serious steak eaters.",,89,28.0,Washington,Snipes Mountain,Columbia Valley,Malbec,Nefarious Cellars
58469,US,"The naturally peppery spice of the Carmenère has been blended down. The result is a wine loaded with blackberry and black cherry fruit, and still plenty of pepper.

58470,Spain,"Staunch red fruit aromas are a bit prickly at first, but within a few minutes they settle on mineral, herbs, anise and licorice.

58477,US,"The more winemaker Chris Upchurch ups the percentage of Mourvèdre, the more delicious this wine becomes.

58479,Portugal,"From the aroma, this seems heavily wooded, but on the palate the wood spice is becoming well integrated with the dark berry fruits and mineral texture. It is certainly young.

58488,France,"The most famous hillside in Morgon gives a satisfyingly structured wine, dominated by a warm character of well-exposed vines, but also with a more serious edge of acidity and fresh juiciness.

58489,US,"This wine is often closed down upon release, and the 2007 is no exception. Plan on putting it into the cellar, or give it many hours of decanting.

It also has good acidity and a firm but not overdone structure.",,91,,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,La Velona
58494,Argentina,"Extremely ripe and concentrated but arguably a bit too massive for its own good. That said, we love the wine's tobacco, cassis and inky qualities, but worry a little about the lemony oak character and overall potency.

58587,Serbia,"This Serbian red wine made from 100% Prokupac has fruity aromas of black berry and plum, with lifted notes of black tea, Christmas baking spices and peppermint. There are flavors of cranberry, Chinese tea and blackberry. The finish is juicy and long.",Triada,88,22.0,Župa,,,Prokupac,Budimir
58588,Argentina,"Standard berry aromas come with notes of leather and animal. This is firm, clacky and shows biting tannins, while the flavor profile revolves around herbal blackberry with a pinch of salt.

58594,US,"This is a fine Viognier made in the California off-dry, fruity style, and if that's what you like, you'll love it. It's crisply balanced in acidity, with very little oak influence, which lets the jammy fruit star.

58599,France,"The unpredictable character of Pinot Noir makes it hard to pull off a Blanc de Noirs. And this wine doesn't entirely succeed.

58601,US,"Shows the fine varietal characteristics of dryness, silkiness and fruitiness you want in a nice Russian River Pinot, with suggestions of cherries, currants, root beer and smoky oak.

58603,US,"Firesteed's Willamette Valley-designated Pinot Noir benefits from better grapes and, in this instance, a riper vintage, than the Oregon bottlings from 2006 and 2007.

58605,Spain,"The bouquet delivers some of that creamy, corn-like smell that many Cavas show. There is also cereal and citrus to the nose.

58608,Spain,"Probably not a Cava for wine snobs. But who says all wines have to be super serious and complex?

58610,US,"Kuleto's 2004 at the age of four years is a little obvious, although it's fruity enough. The oodles of ripe blackberries, currants, cassis and toasty oak are rich and satisfying.

58613,US,"This is a good, solid red wine without being an exciting one. It's dry and full-bodied, with thick, refined tannins.

58621,Spain,"This wine is a “product” in every sense of the word.

58625,US,"Not one of the best Cabs from this venerable winery. Despite a cool vintage, there's a burnt edge to the blackberry pie filling flavors.

58627,Spain,"White raisin and touches of lettuce and celery give this multigrape blend some richness but also a bit of green character.

58628,Spain,"Matchstick, mushroom and licorice nib aromas add character to this fading but textured wine that struggles to offer peach and nectarine flavors.

58629,US,"With a honeyed edge of sweetness to the pineapple and lime flavors, this wine also has a zesty acidity that makes it finish with mouthwatering cleanness.

58636,US,"At first pass, this feels a little tired, with a somewhat feeble nose and flavors that could tend toward bitter.

58642,US,"Comes down on Petite Sirah's rustic, slightly sweet side. Even though the alcohol is pretty high, there's a sugary, porty finish to the blackberry and cherry jam flavors.

58650,US,"The most complete and rewarding of Copain's '04 Pinots, the Kiser En Bas shows the vintner's propensity for tannins, but offers a great wealth of cherries, raspberries, red currants, vanilla, lavender and cedar flavors that mitigate the slight astringency.

58651,US,"Steaks, chops and grilled mushrooms will love this dry, tannic wine.

58652,Spain,"The traditional side of Rioja is exhibited in the wine's vanilla, dill and peppery aromas, but the palate shows lots of red fruit, butter and a core of perfect acidity and tannins.

The flavors are all about white pepper-accented crushed blackberries and cherries, with a salty, beef jerky savory taste, while the tannins give a sharp, structural edge. There's even an acidic cut.

58662,Spain,"CVNE must have done a strict selection in chilly, wet 2002 to get a reserva that's this sound.

58663,New Zealand,"Full-bodied and well-structured, this is the rare New Zealand Pinot that warrants cellaring for a few years prior to enjoyment.

Drink 2010-2018.",Block 3,91,63.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Felton Road
58664,Spain,"An excellent Verdejo from Rueda is as good as fresh, crisp white wine from Spain gets. And the two Victorias that make José Pariente know their stuff.

58667,US,"The best thing about this wonderful Merlot is balance. The winemaker has modulated the blackberry and plum fruit with earthier notes that suggest balsamic, soy-splashed sautéed beef, Portobello mushrooms and coffee.

58668,US,"Solidly in the Rosenblum style, a soft, high-alcohol wine, low in acids and tannins, high in the deliciousness factor.

58671,New Zealand,"Palliser's wines seem to be improving across the range over recent vintages, with this being their best Sauvignon Blanc yet.

58673,France,"This wine is an original.

58676,Australia,"This blend of 57% Cabernet, 27% Shiraz and 16% Merlot is a barrel selection, named for the family matriarch. It's amply oaked, roaring forth with smoke, toast and vanilla, but there's also a tight core of mixed berry fruit and a long finish.

58678,Australia,"The qualitative equal of the excellent 2002, the 2005 Centenary Hill is a big, rich wine that shows just a bit of warmth to its ripe black cherry flavors.

58679,US,"Dark, sappy and effusively scented with boysenberry and black cherry.

58683,US,"Showing Talley's distinctive elegance and brilliant structure, this Chard is a blend of the Rincon and Rosemary's vineyards.

58685,US,"With no oak influence, this Sauvignon Blanc was cool-fermented, preserving fresh fruit, and it did not undergo malolactic fermentation, so that the acidity is brisk. It was aged on the lees. That is a great formula for keeping prices low while crafting a wine of creamy interest.

58687,US,"The grapes for this Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot blend were grown in the Chiles Valley section of Napa. The wine in its youth is extremely tannic and dry, making it unsuitable for drinking anytime soon. But it's exceptionally balanced and has a deep, attractive core of black currant and cedar flavors.

58694,New Zealand,"For a wine with only 9% alcohol, this is surprisingly full bodied, with plenty of weight and richness. A bit of kerosene marks the nose, alongside scents of spice and bergamot, while the flavors run toward apple and citrus. It's a bit sweet (29 g/l residual sugar), but balanced by decent acidity, and it ends in a long, mouthcoating finish.

58710,US,"Champoux is one of Washington's most revered vineyards, known especially for the rich, black cherry fruit on display here. However, this wine seems to be aging rather quickly, the flavors turning soft and leafy in the midpalate, and the wine's rim hinting at the beginning tones of brick.

58715,US,"This wine has muscle and grip; it's a densely layered Cabernet, based upon cassis and loam, with firm, muscular tannins.

58934,Spain,"Aromatic notes of talcum powder and scented candles give this Bordeaux blend from Navarra a light, pleasant bouquet. But the palate is more starching and hard than ideal, leaving a spiky, jagged feel to the wine's raspberry and plum fruit. So rugged and jarring that food is downright mandatory. Ripped but punishing.",Ars Mácula,84,25.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Tandem
58935,US,"Simple and sweet. This Sauvignon has sugary flavors of pineapples, limes, peaches and apples, and benefits from crisp acidity.",,84,14.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Wellington
58936,US,"Even at six-plus years, and despite its origin in superstar grower's Beckstoffer's vineyards, this Cab has an imbalanced sweetness. The sugariness of the blackberry flavors accentuates the tannins, making them awkward and sharp. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",,84,59.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Oakford
58937,US,"A little thin and herbal, but shows enough Chard character to accompany good shellfish or a chicken or veal dish. Modestly oaked, the wine has peach, tangerine, buttercream and smoky flavors.",,84,18.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Simi
58938,Israel,"Medium-bodied and soundly structured, this offers all of the flavor components that one would expect from 100% Cabernet: cassis, blackberry and plum skins. A solid finish with subtle tannins.",Kosher,84,16.0,Galilee,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Recanati
58939,France,"Finely balanced, simple Sauternes with light apricot and honey flavors. With just a touch of botrytis dryness, the aftertaste is more sweet.",Mouton Cadet Réserve,84,,Bordeaux,Sauternes,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Baron Philippe de Rothschild
58940,US,"A spicy but subtle nose of cigar spice and red berry lead into a spirited character of more spice and medium body on the palate. Though the wine has heft, it need more strength in the midpalate and has an overall tartness that could deter. Pair it with grilled meats, though, and you'll find it shapes up.",Sette 7,84,15.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Cabernet Merlot,Macari
58941,Spain,"Rueda is best when it's fresh and dancing, but this 2006 is showing too many signs of the hot year from which it came. It's already tired and soft, with compost and mealy citrus aromas going head to head with grapefruit and marmalade notes. Tasted in December 2007, this was probably a tastier, fresher wine six months prior.",,84,16.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Martinsancho

58945,Italy,"The wine opens thin and a bit stinky (although this blows off eventually) and segues into spicy, herbal notes backed by bright acidity and veiled cherry flavors. It's a bit sharp, with gritty tannins.",Abelardo,84,20.0,Tuscany,Orcia,,Sangiovese,Podere Paganico
58946,Israel,A round and spicy Merlot. Dark plum and blackberry flourish while fleeting nuances of tobacco glimmer on the medium-length finish. The silky texture and soft tannins are sure to please those with a gentler palate.,Kosher,84,16.0,Galilee,,,Merlot,Recanati
58947,US,"Creamy fresh white fruit and toast on the nose hint at a fullness that the wine does not quite deliver on the palate, but overall the fruit is good. This tends toward tart and needs the balance of more oak to cut the edge.",,84,15.0,New York,Cayuga Lake,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay,Cayuga Ridge Estate

58950,Australia,"A blend of Shiraz, Grenache, Cabernet Sauvignon, Mourvèdre and even a tiny bit of Muscadelle, this is perfumed and floral on the nose, but it also boasts scents of cinnamon, coffee, chocolate and earth. It's lush and dense on the palate, rich and creamy in weight and texture, ending with hints of vanilla and spice. Approachable now, but should drink well for up to 10 years.",Émigré,91,80.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Red Blend,The Colonial Estate
58951,Australia,"Perfumed and floral at first, but this wine also features some deeper, darker notes of black pepper and black olive.

58952,US,"This is the most expensive Stevenot Zin I've ever had. It's also the ripest and the best. It's the kind of Foothills Zin that rides on horseback into the mouth, puts up the Zin flag, and declares ownership. Juicy and fruit-driven, it showcases flamboyant blackberry, cassis, cherry, balsamic, soy, sweet leather and spice flavors and a tough, resilient layer of tannins. Cries out for rich meats and cheeses.",Gran Reserve,91,45.0,California,Calaveras County,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel,Stevenot
58953,US,"From Tablas Creek cuttings, this outstanding Roussanne is intentionally picked early enough to preserve acidity, minerality and to keep the alcohol at a sensible level.

58954,Australia,"Seemingly fully mature, this still shows a dark, saturated color, but the flavors are moving from sour plum fruit to more meaty, savory flavors with plenty of pepper and spice. Some chewy tannins remain, but as the clock is ticking on the fruit, this would be better consumed in the short term. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Centenary Hill,91,33.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Jacob's Creek
58955,Australia,"The first vintage of this wine was only in 2002, but already this bottling is proving to be excellent. Floral elements mark the nose, along with spice and blackberries, while the tannins are wonderfully soft, imparting a deliciously lush mouthfeel.

58956,Spain,"For an old-school highlight, look for this lesser known selection-based Reserva, because good grapes from a good year should add up to good wine.

58959,Australia,"As might be expected from a wine not to be released until 2010, this is showing little development or complexity at this stage. What it does have is bountiful raspberry and blueberry fruit and lashings of vanilla, caramel and cedar. Should be a good one down the road.",Meshach,91,,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Grant Burge
58960,Spain,"This is what Albariño is all about! The nose issues a salinic combo of salt water and sea shells along with green banana and melon, while the palate is jumpy, fresh, balanced and intriguing.

58963,Spain,"Smoky, alluring and sexy; this is a fine holdover from the excellent 2001 vintage.

58964,Australia,"The price is right for this tank-aged blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Shiraz and 20% Mourvèdre.

58965,Spain,"Coffee grounds, some minty wood and lots of ripe fruit greet you, and the lower levels contain all the sweet, dark fruit and oak-based chocolate and vanilla one could ever ask for. This is new-age wine to the max, and some might call it overdone.

58966,US,"Shows the classic structure and balance of a fine Napa Cabernet, in the interplay of rich, ripe tannins, acidity and fruit. That makes this 100% Zinfandel elegant. It's also delicious, with wild berry, plum, cola, chocolate and peppery spice flavors.",Luvisi Vineyard,91,36.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Zinfandel,Signorello
58967,France,"The aromas and initial taste are all of new wood. Only later does some fresh red fruit appear, giving the wine a lift. There is enough fruit here, but this needs time for the wood to calm down. Then the wine will show the vibrancy the structure suggests.",,90,24.0,Bordeaux,Graves,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château de Chantegrive
58968,US,"What's so nice about this Cab is that it's the opposite of today's cult Cab style, which is soft and gooey. Instead, it's tannic and acidic and not ashamed of presenting these food-worthy aspects of its personality. Tastes like a young, ageable Third or Fourth Growth Bordeaux, with a good core of black currants and cedar. Put it in the cellar until 2009 or so, and it should hold and improve for another five years.",Crane Ranch Vineyard Hillside Block,90,44.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Crane Brothers
58969,Australia,"A step up in seriousness from Craneford's easy-drinking regular Shiraz, the Fire Station bottling is sourced from 80-year-old vines from the northern Barossa.

There's an intense, smoky aftertaste.",Semillon Noble,90,,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Blanc,,Sémillon,Château Tour de Mirambeau
58971,Spain,"This is not a blow-you-away RDD, but it is a smooth, well-composed red wine with clean, alluring aromas and ripe-styled fruit flavors that touch on raisin but then pull back to black cherry and dark plum. With its integrated tannins and mild finish, this is ready to go now and should hold form for about five years, maybe eight.",,90,30.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Comenge
58972,US,"This was fermented completely in stainless, and finished totally dry. Made from 12-year-old vines, it punches up the aromatics, and focuses on grapefruit and other citrus flavors.

58973,US,"As ripe as the fruit is, and it's very ripe, with showy blackberry, cassis, plum and mocha flavors, this Syrah is dry and balanced, with the acidity and tannic structure that comes from the terroir of this cool Monterey appellation. It's a very interesting wine, with real class and style.",Cedar Lane Vineyard,90,29.0,California,Arroyo Seco,Central Coast,Syrah,Hug
58974,US,"A very interesting wine that clearly shows its cool-climate origins, with a great big burst of brisk acidity that gets the tastebuds whistling. Underneath are pure flavors of green apples and ripe kiwis. The oak is sizable, but perfect for this formula, adding delicious honey, butterscotch and vanilla flavors. This is the best J.

58978,Spain,"With red wines joven usually means a few months in oak. It seems as though this wine was made the same way; there's a kiss of popcorn and buttered toast to the lemon and melon nose, while the palate has life, texture and complexity. Flavorwise, you should enjoy the wine's papaya, green banana and other tempered tropical flavors. Balanced and pleasing, and proof that certain Spanish whites can take some oaking.",Joven,90,23.0,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,,Godello,Guitián
58979,US,"This Rhône-style picnic red is a blend of 47% Syrah, 29% Grenache, 12% Cinsault and 12% Mourvèdre. Scented with the spicy authority of the Syrah, the other grapes add meat and muscle and spread the flavors broadly out across the palate. It's got a good mix of smoke, spicy fruit, meat and sage. The name means “at the moment” and the moment is still a ways away, so air this one out.",Stonetree Vineyard à pic,90,28.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Bunnell Family Cellar
58980,US,"Opens with a blast of freshly ground black peppercorns, and that peppery tastes travels into the flavor.

58982,France,"It is sweet, there's no doubt about it, but it takes a while for this wine to develop in the mouth. Initally, there is just a fresh white pear flavor. Only gradually does the relatively gentle sweetness come through, reinforced by botrytis but balanced by intense acidity.",Clos du Pavillon,89,,Loire Valley,Coteaux du Layon Saint Aubin,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine Philippe Delesvaux
58983,Italy,"Dark in color with thick concentration, this “family” Riserva offers loads of spice lavished over fresh cherry, red fruit and plum.

58984,Italy,"There's a hint of initial ripeness or stewiness on the nose in the form of blackberry preserves and strawberry but it's not enough to be a problem.

58985,South Africa,"A layered nose with aromas of grapefruit, lemon and flowers is the start of this poised and pretty white.

58987,New Zealand,"Steve Bird, who put Thornbury on the map before selling that brand to Villa Maria's owner, is back with a fairly rich, amply endowed Sauvignon Blanc. It's grassier to smell than to taste, with stone fruit and grapefruit flavors and just a hint of herbaceousness on the palate.",Old Schoolhouse Vineyard,89,20.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Bird
58988,Portugal,"The minerality that seems to come from this quinta makes for a wine that needs time, and this wine is defiantly young. However, its chocolate flavors, bitter toast and dense structure all promise well.",Quinta do Coa,89,26.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,CARM
58989,US,"A bit heavy in body, and very extracted, this single-vineyard Pinot from Boonville has jammy flavors of cherries, raspberries and currants. Extensive new oak adds layers of caramelized meringue. Tasty, although a bit obvious, the wine should hold its own for 5 years.",Frattey Shams Vineyard,89,55.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,MacPhail

There's fruit weight on the palate, with the sort of stony flavors that pair with virtually any seafood dish.",,89,21.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Huia
58991,Chile,"Put this on the scale and watch it tip. It's a monster of a Cab that's quite tannic and therefore narrow on the palate. But if given time in a good cellar it may soften into something much more evolved than it is now. Early openers should expect black fruit in spades, with nail-like tannins. Best to have a steak on the grill if you are drinking this any time soon.",Cuvée Alexandre Apalta Vineyard,89,25.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lapostolle
58992,US,"The 2005 vintage was kind to this wine, grown in the warmer, northerly Middle Reach section of the valley. While lacking the depth of the 2002 and 2003, it shows flavorful black currants, cherries and root beer, with a peppery finish. The tannins are rich and fine. Small additions of Zin, Malbec, Petite Sirah and other red varieties add complexity.",DaKine Vineyard,89,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Longboard
58993,US,"Very tight now, with minerally, yeasty flavors of lees and unintegrated smoky new oak. High acidity adds to the impression of austerity.

58995,Chile,"Dark cola, black fruit and marzipan aromas give this a sweet bouquet. The palate is solid, with medium-strength tannins supporting cherry, blackberry and mocha flavors. Oak is no stranger to this wine, so expect ample vanilla and chocolate throughout. A bit herbal, which is common for Chilean Cabernet.",Orzada,89,20.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Odfjell
58996,South Africa,"A big, exuberant nose leads on this impressive Syrah. On the palate, it's a muscular red, with balance, strength and elegant tannins. Mouthfilling but minerally enough to maintain poise, it will age well or pair now with roasted meat.",,89,37.0,Stellenbosch,,,Syrah,Rudi Schultz
58997,Italy,"There's a fun, spicy layer in the foreground of this wine that helps shape a modern, luscious and intense Chianti Classico with noticeable sophistication and dimension.

The tannins are just a supplement to the fruit.",Passagem,89,,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta de Bandeiras
58999,US,"This appellation is better known for red wines, but Bink is establishing a really good track record for this variety that's so hard to get balanced. The wine, which appears to have little if any oak, brims with acid-bright citrus, lemongrass, vanilla and pepper flavors. It appeals especially for its succulent balance.",Randle Hill Vineyard,89,20.0,California,Yorkville Highlands,North Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Bink
59000,Portugal,"Fresh, jammy strawberry aromas, followed by a soft, balanced wine, with tannins and wood in fine harmony. It's ripe, packed with berry fruits, edged with dry tannins.

59001,Chile,"Lo Mejor is the most elevated, worldly Pinot in the Corpora group's portfolio (Veranda, Porta and Agustinos are others). It is ripe and smoky, with alluring berry aromas and smooth black cherry and raspberry flavors. It's warm and a bit fiery on the finish, but with food that won't be a big factor. A good example of what Bío Bío can do with Pinot Noir.",Sereno Reserva Lo Mejor Santa Ana Estate,89,20.0,Bío Bío Valley,,,Pinot Noir,Gracia de Chile
59002,US,"This Syrah shows the bright fruit and crisp, organizing acidity of Domaine Alfred's Chamisal botting, which is their reserve, without quite the lushness and power.

59005,US,"Part of this wine was barrel fermented, which gives it a creamy, spicy richness. The rest was raised in stainless steel, preserving vital fruitiness and acidity. The result is a richly powerful, interesting wine, vibrant in citrus, fig, melon and spice flavors, that finishes thoroughly dry. Sommeliers should note this wine, not only for its inexpensive price but for its versatility and sophistication.",,89,15.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Robert Hall
59006,South Africa,"A lively, toasted spice nose rolls into friendly, flirty, light and balanced flavors on this Chardonnay. Balanced fruit and minerality and a curvy but fresh finish add to the appeal. An elegant wine with personality.",,89,22.0,Stellenbosch,,,Chardonnay,Waterford
59007,US,"This unusual and distinctive Zin has a silky texture and rich, finely ground tannins. The flavors range from classic black and red currants, mulberries, cloves and pepper to pastry flavors of coconut macaroon and fig cookie. Could easily develop over a decade.",Feeney Vineyard,89,48.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
59008,Italy,"There's a subtle candy-like element to this wine's pretty nose that recalls vanilla and cherries sprinkled with dried flowers and green herbs. The wine has a lean, compact feel in the mouth and refreshes the palate thanks to its blueberry flavors and crisp close.",Riserva,89,,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Tenuta di Lilliano

59010,Chile,"A touch earthy and leathery at first, but also berry driven and full, with a lot of run to it.

59012,US,"This is a good, full-bodied, dry Cabernet that delivers with plenty of varietal personality.

59016,Italy,"Three brothers, Pietro, Giulio and Franco, collaborate on this garnet-colored Barbaresco with classic Nebbiolo fragrances of wet earth, wild berries and pressed violets.

59018,US,"This is a dry, tannic and extracted young red wine. Made mainly from Merlot, with 15% Malbec, it has blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate flavors. Feels fancy in the mouth, and might pick up some bottle complexity over the next 3–4 years.",GBR,88,60.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Etude
59019,Italy,"Here is a very nicely balanced Barbaresco with sweet spice notes and plump fruit tones of wild berry, cherry and blackberry. What the wine offers in harmony, it lacks in overt intensity: it shows flat, broad character in the mouth with wet earth and mineral tones on the finish.",Vallegrande,88,,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Grasso Fratelli
59020,Italy,"This youthful expression of Barbera comes forth with ripe and raw aromas of black fruit, plum, prune and wild berries. You really feel the freshness of the fruit here and this wine would pair perfectly with pasta or pizza.",,88,19.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,,Barbera,Damilano
59021,Italy,"This Riserva expression of Barbaresco opens with a light ruby color and charred aromas of wood, spice and smoke. You'll also identify cherry cola, tar, licorice and violet. The mouthfeel is silky with an enduring impression of smoked meat flavors on the finish.",Bricco Riserva,88,56.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Dante Rivetti
59022,US,"Fruity and full-flavored, this quaffable Riesling brings a full share of peachy fruit, honeysuckle and English breakfast tea. The residual sugar is just over 1%, and the acids compensate, giving it good balance.",,88,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Riesling,Cave B
59023,US,"This is a fine Pinot Noir. May not be as full-bodied or fruity as some, but it's truly elegant, crisply refined, and thoroughly dry, offering raspberry, rhubarb, tangerine zest and Dr. Pepper cola flavors that are wrapped into a silky texture. Production was a low 820 cases.",,88,18.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Chime
59024,Italy,This wine shows a touch of age or flatness and its ruby color also shows some mild browning. The wine will hold a few more years but the fruit tones present now won't last forever. You'll get aromas of wild berries and red apple.,Colarej,88,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Cantine Gemma

59027,US,"The 80% new oak on this wine really sticks out, giving toasty, caramelized and vanilla bean notes. That makes the underlying cherry, blackberry and raspberry fruit, which is superripe, taste jammy, almost sweet. The result is a little in your face, but it's quite a rich wine that might develop some bottle nuance over the next 4–6 years.",Reserve,88,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Titus

59030,US,"Appealing flavors in this dry, tart bubbly. Flatters with vanilla bean, lemon zest, tangerine and toast flavors, with a nice edge of yeast.

59034,US,"This Cabernet Franc-based Bordeaux blend is softly approachable now for its wealth of black and red cherry, currant and toasty oak flavors. It has rich tannins and a long, spicy finish.

59038,US,"A pretty good Cab that shows plenty of richness. May lack a bit in nuance, but on the other hand, a little cellaring could benefit. As currently constructed, it's rich and forward in berry-cherry fruit and oak, with lots of spices, and tastes a bit jammy-sweet. Honig's single-vineyard Cabs always seem much better than their generic Napa Valley.",,87,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Honig

59043,US,"Tight, very dark, smoky and thick, this young wine will benefit from extended breathing time.

59044,US,"A sort of reserve (“crafted from our finest French oak barrels”) this bumps up the amplitude and concentration a notch, and seems to combine the distinctive qualities of the other two C'est Syrahs from Walter Dacon. The fruit includes berries, compote, cherries and plums, there are streaks of pepper and chocolate, and a hint of the garrigue and compost that define the winery's Boushey vineyard bottling. A fine effort.",C'est Syrah Magnifique,91,42.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Walter Dacon
59045,Italy,"There is a woody or brambly quality to this Brunello that will remind you of forest brush and wild berries. You'll also get tones of mesquite wood, root beer, licorice and very enticing balsam notes that create a sharp and immediate quality to the overall delivery. This is a different Brunello with its own character, personality and unique intensity.",,91,,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Tornesi

59047,France,"With the extra year of maturity, this is turning into a toast and spice wine, with the citrus fruit now softening into ripe apples and peaches.

59049,Portugal,"It is rare to find a pure Petit Verdot (the grape used in some blends in Bordeaux) anywhere, let alone in Portugal. The Alentejo is a good place, with guaranteed ripeness for this fickle grape. Dark in color, packed with dense tannins and a heavy layer of wood, this is not for the faint-hearted. It is certainly ripe and rich.",,91,44.0,Alentejano,,,Petit Verdot,Cortes de Cima
59050,France,"Unlike the heavily oaked Cuvée Crescendo produced from the same vineyard in 2005, this wine relies much more on ripe black fruits and open tannins.

59054,US,"Big, powerful and ripe, in the manner of Santa Lucia Highlands, this Pinot Noir has very dense, tannic flavors of cherries, black raspberries and cola, accented with spicy oak.

59057,US,"This is a very rich, fruity Pinot Noir, so if you like ripeness, you'll love it.

59058,US,"You don't want to drink this wine now. It's way too tannic, which also accentuates the acidity. It all makes for a tough palate experience, despite rich raspberry, cherry, cola and cedar flavors. So stash this vastly interesting Pinot Noir in your cellar for 3–5 years. But if you can't, decant. Even overnight.",Westside Road Neighbors,91,67.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem

59075,US,"As always, the Otis vineyard carries defining scents of pepper, sage, earth and stem; the fruit is restrained and also quite herbal. And yet the wine has old vine character, and ages beautifully, more like a Bordeaux than anything from this country. It's a fine bottle to tuck away into the cellar.

59079,Australia,"This is pretty oaky stuff, loaded with toast and cedar aromas, but still showing some lush blueberry fruit underneath.

59195,US,"A little too ripe, this Cab is compromised by a Porty, raisiny aroma. It's also pretty tannic, with an undertow of red and black currant flavors. Needs rich fare to tame it. Drink now.",,85,28.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Halter Ranch
59196,Greece,"This Sauvignon Blanc from Greece is in step with the general Greek white wine style: refreshing, clean and approachable.

Simply good and a definite Asian food and seafood cohort.",Amethystos,85,17.0,Drama,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Costa Lazaridi
59197,US,"A little soft and tired and lacking in the vivacity you want in a red wine. But it's fully dry, and the cherry, cassis and spice flavors are savory.",,85,20.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Eagle Castle

59199,US,"A bit too tannic now, this Cab-Syrah blend gives a hard, astringent feel to the palate. It's not entirely clear if the blackberry fruit is strong enough to withstand aging.

59206,Spain,"Already in the twilight of its lifespan, this is a friendly rosé with a little wiggle and kick.

59213,US,"A problematic wine. It's too tannic and closed to enjoy now, and the fruit flavor may not be powerful enough to withstand aging.

59216,US,"Peju's regular Napa Cab sometimes seems to take second seat to their reserve and single-vineyard bottlings. That's how it is with this good, but average, bottling.

59232,US,"This Chardonnay is creamy and scented with vanilla, ripe apple and pineapple.

59286,Australia,"A blend of fruit from the northern end of the Barossa, this is dark and loamy, filled with earth, spice and tobacco, but also featuring hints of meat, black olive and blueberries.

59287,Australia,"Shows the warmth of the vintage in its slightly elevated alcohol levels and flavors of brandied black cherries. It's big, a bit bulky and lacking elegance, but still a chunky, flavorful mouthful of Shiraz. As predicted in our last review of this wine (8/1/05), it should drink well through 2010.",Stonewell,90,75.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Peter Lehmann
59288,Australia,"A lush, supple Shiraz with cassis and blackberry fruit wrapped in a soft coat of caramel, coffee and vanilla oak. Nicely complex, yet at the same time this is easy to drink.

59289,US,"This is a very interesting rosé from just north of the Golden Gate.

59290,US,"Good, rich Zinfandel that brings a Napa elegance and sophistication to the variety's wild and woolly personality.

59291,Portugal,"Portal's 2004 vintage is a powerful effort from an average year.

This should age well, with its present dominant dry structure.",Vintage,90,,Port,,,Port,Quinta do Portal
59292,Portugal,"Still with all its primary fruit flavors, ripe blackberries and figs, this wine currently only hints at its density of structure.

59460,US,"It's quite tannic, as is to be expected from this founding Red Mountain vineyard, and yet the wine seems smoothed over, buffed out. The black cherry and cassis fruit does not penetrate. Drink up.",Klipsun Vineyard,87,60.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Covington
59461,US,"Hints of crushed stones lend a mineral focus to this dry, elegantly structured wine. It's piercingly tart on the palate with loads of fresh lime and lemon flavor, but gains richness on the midpalate with streaks of fresh apple and crisp yellow peach.

59462,US,"Nearly purple in color, it is equally intense in flavor, almost like sipping a straight red wine, save for the low alcohol.

59464,Turkey,"Aromas of black cherry and green pepper lead into flavors of cherry, menthol, pickled jalapeño, oregano and lavender. Tannins mildly outweigh acidity.

59465,US,"Picturesque with a crystalline salmon color, it begins with the scent of just-bitten nectarine. The following flavors of tart apple and a slightly bitter salinity ensure the uniqueness of this wine. Mourvèdre (57%) is in the lead, followed closely by Grenache (28%) and Counoise (15%), all coming from the original cuttings of the Château de Beaucastel. This age-worthy blend will be fun to track 2017–2019.",Dianthus Estate Mourvèdre-Grenache-Counoise,87,27.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Rosé,Tablas Creek
59466,Italy,"Made from the rare Pallagrello Bianco grape, this unfolds with aromas of toasted oak, mature apricot, acacia and beeswax. These carry over to the palate with candied lemon and apple.

59471,US,"It shows ultrarich tannins and a flavor complexity ranging from briary wild blackberries and prunes to currants, nettles, sweet tea and softened cola. It's absolutely dry, despite or perhaps because of very high alcohol. The wine is unapologetic about that ripeness, instead asking only to be happily paired with barbecue.",,87,20.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Novy

59476,Spain,"Stalky aromas suggest animal hide and roasted fruit. The wine is rubbery, firm and leathery in feel, with plum, berry, raisin and other dark-fruit flavors.

59484,US,"Extend aging in Russian oak lends a smoky, earthy intensity to fresh apple and pear notes on this medium-bodied wine.

59489,US,"In vintage after vintage, the winery has chosen to make this blush wine heavier than most rosés in California.

59492,US,"The hope and prayer of this wine is that it will age, because right now it's kind of aggressive. The tannins are very strong and astringent, and they seem out of place with the ripe, jammy fruitiness you usually find in softer wines. May be better after a few years.",Cupa Grandis,85,55.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Petite Sirah,EOS
59493,Spain,"A bit of forward oak comes across on the nose, while mocha and pretty good berry fruit keep things focused.

Easygoing in the mouth, it tastes very much like sweet grape juice.",Rosa di Monte Torre,85,23.0,Veneto,Veneto,,Moscato,Gorgo
59498,Spain,"A typically reserved Navarran wine is what this is. The nose offers dry red fruit, spice and not much else.

59504,Portugal,"A traditional medium style, aged in cask for three years before bottling. This is light, flavored with dates and softly sweet. It misses some of the classic Madeira acidity, leaving a gentle aftertaste.",Rainwater,85,,Madeira,,,Madeira Blend,Broadbent

59508,Spain,"A little creamy, waxy and scattershot, but also far more exotic and different than most $8 wines. This is barrel-fermented Viura, but the oak level is light and manageable.

59509,Germany,"Raumland's Marie-Luise is a blanc de noirs of 100% Pinot Noir that comes across as toasty and nutty on the nose and palate, without obvious red-berry fruitiness or the earthy, sous-bois complexity of the variety.

Tasted in March 2008, it still had that acid-forward, crushed berry tartness you find in wine straight out of the fermenter. But it's a very good Zin that will improve in the bottle.

59542,Australia,"This medium-bodied wine is a stylistic departure from the stereotypical Aussie stainless-steel Sauvignon Blanc, being fermented and aged in old French oak barrels for eight months. The result is a citrusy wine with greater depth and richer texture, even some leesy, slightly toasty notes that complement rather than overwhelm the fruit.

59550,Spain,"Quite brambly and funky, with a roasted “country” quality that points it toward leather and rubber.

59570,US,"A sweaty smell opens the wine, followed with light strawberry and leafy herb notes. In the mouth the wine is thin and tart, with a hard, tannic finish.

59643,US,"It's hard to find good Washington Malbec under $20. Start here. Stone Tree (Wahluke Slope) vineyard provided much of the fruit, and there is a small (10%) amount of new oak in the mix.

59648,US,"This is a hugely flavored, extracted Pinot Noir, distinctly Californian in its ripeness and size. It's massive in cherries and raspberries, with hints of cocoa, anise, Indian spices and black pepper. With 60% new French oak, it's also pretty toasty.

59652,US,"This big, powerful Pinot Noir needs some time to resolve its contradictions. It's totally dry, with silky tannins and fine coastal acidity, but there's a heavy density to the cherry, orange zest, spice and sandalwood flavors.

59657,US,"This is pure Cabernet from the estate vineyard. These are still young vines, and though the potential for greatness is there, they don't deliver the complexity of their neighbor Ciel du Cheval—yet.

59667,US,"A broad streak of vanilla is set against beautifully ripe, tart and polished raspberry and black cherry fruit.

59821,Italy,"There's a distinctive herbal accent that gives this wine background notes of forest floor, bramble, tight berries and mint.

59828,US,"Compared to a Napa Cab, this is a rustic, sharp-edged offering whose tannins have a jagged, green edge. But if you're complaining that Napa Cabs don't go with food, try this one.

59855,US,"Petite Sirah can handle high alcohol better than most California reds, and while this one is 15.7% and has a chili pepper heat, its inherent size makes it more or less balanced. The tannins are gigantic, and the fruit is enormous in blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and coffee flavors.

59856,Australia,"Like a couple of other Colonial Estate 2005s, this has a lifted nose that flirts with volatile vinyl and acetone scents, then settles down to deliver spice and chocolate.

59861,New Zealand,"Palliser's attempt at a luxury bottling of Pinot Noir features plenty of oak and some noticeably sturdy tannins.

59862,Spain,"Earthy and heavily toasted, especially upon first take. This is a serious multigrape wine from the outskirts of RDD that needs a few years in the cellar and then a decanting.

The tannins are quite firm, giving an astringent bite, while the fruity-oaky flavors are massive.

59907,Spain,"With 20% Garnacha, this Navarran Merlot carries a green and lactic streak that makes it a tough go. The palate is gigantic and oversaturated, which makes the whole clumsy and rough.",Palacio de Eza,82,12.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Merlot,Tandem
59908,US,"Made in the sweet, sugary style that many consumers like, this is almost like an off-dry dessert wine. Tastes like a citrus and peach power drink, with alcohol.",,82,10.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Pinot Grigio,Montevina
59909,US,"There's an appealing earthiness on the nose and palate, but the overall character is a bit discordant. It has some complexity but not the balance one wants from a Chardonnay.",NAKED,82,15.0,Pennsylvania,Pennsylvania,,Chardonnay,Chaddsford
59910,Chile,"Sweet and chunky to start, with vanilla and red fruit aromas. The flavors are raspberry and cherry, and while it's kind of short on complexity, it more than gets the job done for $10. Clean, fresh and something you can drink without a lot of pondering.",Última Reserve,87,10.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Veo
59911,Italy,"Slightly quirky but wholly acceptable aromas of animal or natural rubber make a fleeting first impression. The wine then relaxes and delivers pleasing aromas of wild berry, spice and forest floor. The jury's out on how long the wine will age, but five years is a safe bet.",Preda Sarmassa,87,,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Virna Borgogno
59912,Italy,"Moscato d'Asti is such a wonderfully delicious wine and this expression from the folks at Ceretto offers sweet aromas of honey, peach blossom, white flower and acacia.

59913,US,"Even people who like lots of buttered toast and smoky vanilla in their Chards might find this one a little over the top.

59914,Italy,"Here's a very ripe expression of Roero Riserva with jammy aromas of strawberry and blueberry. The softness of the mature fruit, however, is tightly pulled back by the natural dryness and bitterness of the Nebbiolo tannins.",Roche dra Bossora Riserva,87,,Piedmont,Roero,,Nebbiolo,Michele Taliano
59915,US,"This is quite light and lemony, closer to an Italian Pinot Grigio than to an Oregon Pinot Gris. What it lacks in flesh it compensates for in freshness and vitality; the subtle fruit flavors suggest Asian pear, jicama and cucumber. It would be a lovely match for a light fish such as rainbow trout or Dover sole.",Traditions,87,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Pinot Gris,Milbrandt
59916,Italy,"Made with the little-known Ruché grape that is believed to be native of the Asti area of Italy's Piedmont region, this bright and ruby-colored red wine offers floral and simple berry aromas.

59918,US,"Soft and approachable, this seems more like a generic red than a pure Cabernet Sauvignon. It's quite ripe, ready to drink, and certainly smooth. What is not there is any particular varietal character or sense of place. This is a medium-bodied red that could be from anywhere.",Arbitrage,87,49.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Market Vineyards
59919,Italy,"This Roero benefits from an added layer of spice, clove and cinnamon that sits tight over floral notes and wild berries (a tiny percent of Barbera is added to the blend).

Drink immediately.",Classic Series,87,12.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Montes
59921,Chile,"An aggressive, forward, high-acid wine with a lot of quality as well. The nose mixes dried cheese, leather, heat and savory red fruit aromas, while the palate rides a tight line of acidity toward angular raspberry and cherry flavors.

59922,US,"From the dark color, plummy aroma and heavy mouthfeel, you know this is a big, ponderous Pinot Noir. Nothing light or silky about it. Packs a punch with red berry, mushroom, red currant and smoked meat flavors, with the tannic pack of a Syrah, and finishes very dry. Aging is a gamble.",,87,28.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Riverbench

59924,Romania,"Elegant and feminine on the nose with lovely cassis, toasted oak and violet notes, this medium-bodied Cab is another excellent bargain from Romania's Prahova Valley.

59927,Lebanon,"The Jeune Red from Château Musar's second line (formerly labeled Musar Cuvée Rouge) is a blend of Cinsault, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon that smells sweetly of ripe black cherries with rustic herbal and earthy notes. It opens softly with sweet blackberries and a hint of green bramble, but is chased by a mid-palate of fairly aggressive tannins and acidity. Fermented and aged in concrete vats, the Musar Jeune is completely unoaked and intended for early consumption, but would probably do nicely with some bottle aging as well.",Jeune Red,87,20.0,Bekaa Valley,,,Red Blend,Château Musar

59929,US,"A little soft in texture, but interesting for its mosaic of blackberry, pepper, smoked meat, currant and balsam flavors, and the way the firm tannins provide structure.

59930,Chile,"Dark, fruity and common in every way, but sometimes that's all you need.

Totally drinkable and likable.",Estate Bottled,87,8.0,Lontué Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Korta
59931,US,"There's so much raspberry, cherry, cola, clove, cinnamon and pepper flavor in this wine, it's hard to know where to begin. It's also dry, with smoky, vanilla oak notes.

59938,US,"There's no oak in this dry, crisp, clean white wine. It shows the tangy citrus, green grass, vanilla and spice flavors you want in a nice Sauvignon Blanc, with just a touch of gooseberry.

59940,Spain,"A little more herbal, stalky and tomato-influenced than the riper, fresher 2005, but still an elegant, complex wine that shines a positive light on this little-known region at the base of the Pyrenees. Tobacco, tomato leaf, root beer and bouillon flavors set up an herbal, almost Bordeaux-like finish. Layered and structured to boot. Drink now through 2012.",Blecua,90,100.0,Northern Spain,Somontano,,Red Blend,Viñas del Vero

59942,Portugal,"A big rich wine in taste, and well balanced with the alcohol, giving a smooth texture, with good density of black plum juice flavors. It is a solid, chunky structure, a potential powerhouse, looking for aging 5–6 years.",Passadouro,90,,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Passadouro
59943,US,"Previous vintage were called L'Etalon but a threatened legal action prompted the name change. It's the same type of Bordeaux blend.

59944,US,"In this newest vintage of Oriana, the Riesling component has been bumped up to 18%; the rest is half Viognier, 31% Roussanne. The three grapes complement each other well; the Riesling adding aromatics, acidity and a barely perceptible amount of residual sugar. This opens with a vitamin pill aroma that slowly dissipates; the fruit flavors are a mix of pineapple and Satsuma orange, with lots of natural acidity.",Oriana White,90,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,White Blend,Brian Carter Cellars
59945,Portugal,"Just turning in color, a wine that is beginning to mature. It has leathery texture over spice, ripe tannins and flavors of red fruit jelly.

59949,US,"From a single vineyard on Snipes Mountain, this is a forceful, dark and liquorous version of Harrison Hill, which often carries more herbal accents.

59951,Argentina,"Deep as a country well, with lush black plum and blackberry aromas as well as lead pencil and balsam wood.

59952,US,"A lean, steely and slightly herbaceous Chardonnay, whose brisk elegance makes up for the absence of richness.

59955,Italy,"Here is a very impressive Rosso di Montalcino with thick, rich concentration and pretty aromas of black fruit, spice and cola.

The tannins are tight and firm.",,90,,Tuscany,Rosso di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Il Cocco
59956,Argentina,"A touch leathery and cooked at first, but with time the bouquet deftly blends saucy, savory Syrah aromas with sun-baked black fruit notes.

59958,Italy,"Although this Brunello is from the newly released 2005 vintage, it has aromas and textures that remind you of a wine that is older still.

There are also nicely integrated tones of exotic spice and mesquite wood at the back.",,90,,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Sesti
59959,US,"Dark, tannic and full-bodied, this five grape Bordeaux blend from a classic Washington vintage is 100% Alder Ridge fruit. This is a fine effort, cellar-ready and substantial.

59967,US,"When first opened, despite significant bottle age, it's a bit stubborn, tannic, hard, and showing some heat, iron, black olive, and earth.

60001,US,"Soft and a bit hot in alcohol, this Cab has luscious flavors of blackberry jam, licorice and smoky oak. It's pretty tannic now, with a sandpapery mouthfeel. Doesn't seem like an ager, but nice now through 2011.",Estate,88,55.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frazier

60009,US,"Here is a good value effort, smoky, chewy and dense, with strong flavors but solid Merlot varietal character. There is unusual smokiness in the wine—presumably from barrel toast—but enough ripe fruit to offset that and the substantial tannins. The spicy finish suggests American oak barrels were used.",,88,15.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Merlot,Whidbey Island Winery
60010,New Zealand,"Shows some slightly flinty notes on the nose, while the bulk of the flavors run more toward citrus and nectarine.

60013,US,"The best of the 2006 McKinley Springs reds, this overcomes a fairly heavy dose of vanilla-flavored oak and moves into mixed cherry, plum, mocha, coffee and spice.

Very refreshing and clean.",,88,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Viognier,William Church
60030,Italy,"The strength of this Brunello is the elegance of its aromas, which are enticing and playful but not too intense.

In the mouth, however, the wine tastes lean and slightly sour.",,87,,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Terralsole
60031,US,"Showing the rustic power of Charbono, this is an inky dark, bone-dry, tannic wine, but California's sun stars in the immensely ripe black currant flavors. Crisp, bright acidity cuts through, making it a good partner for tomato sauce and cheese-based Italian fare.

60036,Chile,"A little angular on the nose, but there's no question about its identity. This wine smells and tastes like true Pinot Noir; it's ripe and has nice flow, with flavors of red plum, spiced black cherry and peppercorn. Is it Burgundy, Oregon or anything like that?

60037,Italy,"Máté was founded by a Canadian writer and his artist wife in 1997. The 2003 Brunello offers lots of vanilla, spice and toast. In fact, there's not much else here.

60042,US,"Nice aromas suggest cassis and deep, wild mountain berry; the wine has a suppleness long missing from the Hogue lineup. Tannins are still quite evident, and in this young wine come across as just a bit green and scrapey.

60052,Italy,"The nose is rather neutral save for distant aromas of cherry fruit, boysenberry and spice.

60054,Chile,"Nicely done and balanced, especially for Chilean rosé comprised of heavier grape types like Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz.

60056,Australia,"You might expect a GSM that weighs in at 15.5% alcohol to be a big, rich, lush wine. But in this case, you'd be wrong.

60065,US,"Reductive, rubbery and closed at first, this wine breathes into life, with cranberry and tart berry fruit augmented with hints of butter and spice.

A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",,83,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Viña Herminia
60086,Spain,"Fizzy and foamy and aggressive. To give it a frame of reference, it is similar to Brachetto or Frascati from Italy, but it's clumsy on the palate and tastes too much like red licorice and candied fruit to be taken too seriously. Also a bit cloying on the finish. Imported by National Distributing Co., Inc.",Reynal Vino de Aguja,83,10.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Rosé,Pinord
60087,US,"Porty sweet and hot, with flavors of chile peppers, blackberry jam and chocolate. Must be the high alcohol of 15.7% Last year's bottling was far better, with alcohol of only 14.4%.",,83,25.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Barbera,Christian Lazo
60088,Greece,"A heavy nose of thyme and pine in the typical retsina style will either intrigue or deter drinkers of this affordable, traditional wine. Rustic and simple, the wine is refreshing when chilled and offers more of the minty, herbal, pine character that lovers of retsina covet. An affordable choice for warm weather enjoyment.",Retsina of Attica,83,7.0,Retsina,,,White Blend,Kourtaki

60090,US,"Nice and balanced, an elegant Zin with classic flavors of wild cherries, cola, herbs and spices, with a delicate mouthfeel that finishes totally dry. A scour of dusty tannins gives it fine structure. Really notable for its silky purity.",,90,20.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hobo
60091,US,"Shows the tangy minerality this cool appellation is known for. The pear, green apple, lime and kiwi fruit has a cold metal, almost chalky edge that lends this wine a Chablisian complexity. Bone dry and elegant, it should develop over the next five years.",Estate,90,27.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse
60092,US,"Beautiful Pinot, from this new winery headquartered in Dry Creek Valley. Shows long hangtime cherry, blackberry, blueberry, raspberry and cola flavors, grounded in earthier notes of coffee, rhubarb and wild mushroom, and finishes dry and elegant. Would benefit from higher acidity, which limits its ageability.",Winemaker's Reserve Peters Vineyards,90,45.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kokomo
60093,Australia,"With only 10% new oak used for this cuvée, there's just a hint of vanilla here; the aromas are dominated by black cherries and dusty spice notes. The flavors follow suit, picking up a bit of blueberry as well, delivered via a silky-textured palate. Finishes crisp, making it a good candidate with burgers or chops. Drink now–2015.",Plexus S-G-M,90,35.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Rhône-style Red Blend,John Duval Wines
60094,US,"Swanson deftly avoided green, unripe flavors in this cool vintage, although this wine flirts with them, offering a spearmint edge to the pineapple, peach, fig and honeysuckle flavors. It's really a delicious wine, dry and clean in acidity, with a long, racy finish.",,90,21.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Pinot Grigio,Swanson
60095,Italy,"Intense and penetrating, this wine delivers lavish layers of berry fruit, cherry cough drop, coffee and plum.

60096,Spain,"Here's an affordable Bierzo red that earns big points for its straightforward, no-nonsense accessibility and balance. The bouquet offers ample minerality, a sprinkle of burnt toast and friendly red fruit. The palate is moderately deep and pure, with spice, pepper and vanilla on the finish. A fine reflection of the region and the 2005 harvest.",Pago de Valdoneje,90,14.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Vinos Valtuille

60098,Australia,"The fruit for this cuvée comes from an older block of vines, then goes into French oak for aging, so it's substantially different from The Willows' regular Shiraz bottling. Cinnamon, pepper, cherry and vanilla notes intermingle on the nose, imparting a distinct cinnamon-red hot character that's balanced on the palate by creamy layers of cherry and raspberry fruit. Supple and elegant on the finish. Drink now–2014.",Bonesetter,90,64.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,The Willows
60099,Australia,"Winemaker Stuart Bourne calls 2003 a thinking man's vintage, and he was clearly on form, crafting a delicious wine filled with blackberry tea aromas and flavors.

60101,US,"This has long been one of the best Sauvignon Blanc-Viognier blends in California, and the '06 continues that tradition. Coming from a cool vintage, it's very dry and racy, with a scour of acidity and stony, minerally flavors, with touches of citrus blossom and wildflower. No, it's not a fruit bomb, but it's a sleek, elegant wine, in the European tradition.",T-T Vineyard Cuvée R,90,26.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Iron Horse
60102,US,"This is forward, fruity and quite ripe and round, with flavors of peach, pear and apricot. The acid is retained, but this is unusually ripe for the vineyard. The peach flavors dominate, nicely accented with hints of cinnamon and toast. Great fruit, good structure, much less new oak. Still quite young and needing time to add nuance, but plenty of power.",Cold Creek Vineyard,90,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Januik Winery
60103,Australia,"The Beast seems to be in a bit of an awkward stage right now, showing a touch of alcohol atop its cedar, blackberries, vanilla and chocolate. It's full-bodied, firmly structured by dusty tannins, and shows good drive and freshness, although there's a slightly raisiny edge to the finish. Give it another few years to pull itself together. Drink 2010–2020.",The Beast,90,90.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Hentley Farm
60104,US,"This is not an ageable Cab, but it is balanced and complex, and has more than $20 worth of elegance. Dry and softly tannic, the Provençal herb, black cherry and oak flavors make you reach for a second glass.",,90,20.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hobo
60105,US,"The winery does well with this wine, which once again seems to carry all the right stuff, a pleasing mix of lime and grapefruit, Meyer lemon and meringue, nuanced with ginger spice.

60106,Australia,"Another in the long list of well-priced wines from Rolf Binder, this blend of 60% Shiraz and 40% Grenache boasts aromas of smoked meats, cola and spice, maybe even a touch of lavender. It's not terribly rich or concentrated, but makes up for that with complexity and charming spice-box, meat and black olive flavors. Best now–2012.",The Schnell,90,17.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz-Grenache,Magpie Estate

60109,US,"Clifton Hill has established itself as a premier source for Washington Syrah. One look at the glass shows you why: it's as black as the night sky, with only the rim showing purple/garnet. Concentrated but not fat or jammy, it frames its black fruits with barrel fat and hints of pineapple. Young as it is, the wine has smoothed out nicely, and washes into a soft finish with all of its fruits wrapped in a lick of butterscotch.",Clifton Hill Vineyard,90,30.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Chatter Creek

60111,Spain,"Old-vines Verdejo from Rueda can amount to something special, and this vineyard-select beauty has it going on. The bouquet is clean, with touches of saline, mineral and lime.

And the finish is a whopper in terms of length and purity.",Pie Franco,90,20.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Blanco Nieva
60112,Australia,"Boasts a dense, inky color, but at this tender age the flavors lack the weight and opulence of the 2005 version. Coffee and cedar notes frame tart blackberries, finishing long and elegantly.

60117,Australia,"More lifted and aromatic than some other vintages of the Stonewell Shiraz, the 2002 features red fruit flavors and a slightly herbal tinge.

60118,Spain,"Consistency is a virtue in this business, and this wine tastes almost exactly like the highly recommended 2005. The nose blends green grass and golden fruits, while the palate is clean, intense and snappy.

Acidity and cherry flavors are dominant over the dry core.",Château des Capitans,90,,Beaujolais,Juliénas,,Gamay,Georges Duboeuf
60122,US,"Inviting, fresh, racy scents mix pineapple, citrus and light tropical fruits. There is an interesting mouthfeel not unlike Sémillon, though none is indicated in the blend. The wine has substantial length and unusual highlights of spice, clove and mint, along with plenty of rich, ripe fruit to hold down the center palate. Not shy at 14.8% alcohol, this is a fine effort from consulting winemaker Charlie Hoppes.",Estate,90,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Goose Ridge

60128,Italy,"This Brunello has an edgy, raw feel that translates into aromas of white cherry, wild raspberries and violets.

60130,US,"Pure varietal, this estate-grown Malbec from Snipes Mountain (central Yakima Valley) is deep and fascinating, with luscious plum and berry flavors accented with floral highlights.

60131,Spain,"Very dark and oaky, with lemon, bacon, charcoal and high-toned black fruit aromas. The palate is rich and warm, almost heavy, with intense blackberry, chocolate and figgy flavors.

60132,Portugal,"A blend of Alvarinho and Trajadura, this combines a creamy texture with bright green fruit acidity. There is weight as well as freshness, the aftertaste rich while also crisp.",Varanda do Conde,90,,Vinho Verde,,,Portuguese White,Provam
60133,US,"It's pretty chilly at Roche's Carneros vineyard, and this wine is not one of those superripe Syrahs. It shows a nice array of cherries and berries, but is also very peppery, with a fine note of grilled, charred beef on the bone. It's a complex, pleasing wine for drinking now with upscale fare.",,90,26.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Syrah,Roche
60134,US,"This is a big, extracted, dense wine whose muscularity makes it a bit too oversized now. It's all primary cherries and raspberries, sweet red currants and sandalwood, and also is quite acidic and tannic. Feels clumsy and jagged, but that's a function of extreme youth. Cellar for 5–6 years, and it should be fine.",Babcock Vineyards,90,62.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Pacific Coast
60135,US,"Good price for an upscale Chardonnay this rich and interesting.

60137,France,"Light, almost delicate wine, offering freshness, green fruits and a fine tangy texture. The citrus is prominent, but the wine as a whole is easy, fresh, developing quickly, touched finally with caramel.",Les Chasseignes,89,23.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Fouassier
60138,Spain,"Dark, sweet and candied on the nose, with hints of raisin and licorice that become more prominent in the mouth. Saturated but also somewhat monotone and single-leveled in terms of flavor, where you get a narrow band of sweet black cherry and raisin in front of a short finish. Very nice as always, but not the best Allende we've reviewed.",Allende,89,26.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Finca Allende
60139,US,"Very good price for a Riesling of this quality. It's very dry and high in acidity, cleansing the palate and stimulating it to appreciate rich fare, from liver paté on toast to grilled trout or chicken satay. Or delicious on its own, with fresh citrus, apricot and peach fruit flavors.",,89,14.0,California,El Dorado County,Sierra Foothills,Riesling,Jacella
60140,France,"An edgy, mineral style, full in the mouth, with fruit flavors that definitely go towards pear and apricot and away from herbaceous. It's a great style that allows the wine to age, with a firm texture to go with the fruit.",Les Belles Vignes,89,27.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Fournier Père et Fils
60141,US,"This Sangiovese-dominated blend displays herb, olive and earth components wrapped around supple, well-modulated red fruits.

60142,Argentina,"A joint venture between the Renacer winery of Argentina and Chile and Allegrini from the Veneto in Italy. Thus it makes sense that this five-grape blend is done in the Amarone style, with concentrated, dried grapes. Aromas are generous, minty and floral, and the palate is jammy and concentrated. Rich and a little raisiny, just like Amarone. Drink now.",Enamore,89,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Bodega Renacer

60145,South Africa,"Everything about this white smacks of elegance: the slatey, citrus nose, the clean, refreshing slate, asparagus and lime flavors, the flinty, lemon-lime finish.

60146,Italy,"Here is a modern Brunello with an obvious wood or oak-related element that sits on top of blackberry, mature cherry, raspberry and cola.

60148,Spain,"A well-made and refreshing wine for the price. The nose is crisp and smells of nettles, grapefruit, cilantro and stony minerals, while the feel is zesty and the flavors bring a mix of green fruits, citrus and tropicality. Stays on point from start to finish. A fine wine for summer sipping.",,89,15.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Palacio de Bornos
60149,Italy,"What stands out here is the purity and elegance of this wine's fruit-driven bouquet. This is a Rosso di Montalcino, but it drinks almost like a Brunello (which is by law aged more years in the cellar) thanks to its sophisticated style and integrated spice notes. The main difference is that you can taste the wine's youth here.",,89,,Tuscany,Rosso di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Molino di Sant'Antimo
60150,Australia,"A solid example of cool-climate Australian Cabernet, Yering Station's 2005 boasts slightly lifted aromas of dried spices and wintergreen, easing into cassis and mint on the palate.

60151,Chile,"Very nice, with aromas of olive, herbal plum, bacon, salami and leather. It's fresh and lively in the mouth, but with some weight and heft.

60152,US,"As usual, the Nina Lee Syrah is dark, chewy, and hits the mid-fifteens with its alcohol. But it somehow pulls together an impression of balance, highlighted by sweet and tangy blueberry/blackberry fruit. The acids are not quite integrated, and the wine has lost some subtlety – it has traded its elegance for sheer fruit power.",Nina Lee,88,50.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Spring Valley Vineyard
60153,US,"Scents of prune, coffee and smoke lead into a chewy, substantial wine with plenty of concentration.

The best of the new releases from Lone Canary.",,88,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Lone Canary
60154,France,"It is the blend of Malbec (Cot) and Cabernet Franc that gives this wine its intense, dry, tannic core.

60158,New Zealand,"Burgundy purists might turn up their noses, but that's their loss, as Forrest's 2007 Pinot Noir offers a lush, round mouthful of black cherry fruit, providing ample drinking pleasure.

60159,France,"Spicy and minty, here is a wine full of fresh, soft flavors, but given a backbone by some dusty, warm tannins. It is perfumed, the fruit given a vibrant edge, and demanding food.

60160,France,"The Aubance is part of the network of small rivers that eventually flows into the Loire in Anjou. The appellation produces gently sweet wines like this one, from Chenin Blanc.

60165,US,"The Frederick is Spring Valley's Bordeaux blend  and it would be nice to see Spring Valley turn it down a bit and bring back some of the toasted grain nuances that set it apart from the rest of the Walla Walla AVA.

60169,US,"A first-time red blend from Nefarious. It's a bit lighter and smoother than the varietal reds, but still carries the winery's signature of firm acids, stiff tannins, layered aromas and tightly wound fruit. Red berries, currant, pomegranate and stone are the most noticeable flavors, with some pretty chocolate in the finish.",The Spinner Red Wine,88,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Nefarious Cellars
60170,Chile,"Starts with a powerful Carmenère nose of herbs, olive, berry fruit and pepper. Nice mouthfeel, with savory, mildly herbal flavors accenting core berry and plum. A nice, expressive, honest varietal wine. An easy drinker with plenty of body.",1865 Single Vineyard,88,18.0,Maule Valley,,,Carmenère,San Pedro
60171,US,"Rounder and more fruity than the inaugural 2007 Pinot Gris, this has succulent green apple and Bosch pear flavors balanced against crisp, refreshing acids.",,88,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Pinot Gris,Mercer
60172,Italy,"This deeply garnet-colored wine offers a very perfumed bouquet of church incense and potpourri. You'll also get background tones of Indian spice, dried lavender and hickory smoke. The wine is supple and smooth on the close.",Ronco dei Ciliegi,87,33.0,Central Italy,Forlì,,Sangiovese,Castelluccio
60173,France,"Grassy, smoky wine, with black plum skin tannins dominant. It has just enough warmth to balance the acidity, a wine that is black currant juicy and mineral, with a dry core.",,87,9.0,Loire Valley,Anjou,,Cabernet Franc,Château de la Guimonière
60174,US,"This is the winery's mass-production, off-dry bottling, reliable and versatile. Flavors mix peach, nectarine, honeycomb and lemon tea, with a nice fullness through the finish.",Cellarmaster's,87,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Riesling,Columbia Winery
60175,Australia,"Starts off promising, with some dark fruit aromas and an attractive tea-like nuance, then delivers simpler, somewhat grapy fruit flavors. It's full bodied, but with a certain reserve or austerity to its mouthfeel, finishing firm. Probably best in another year or two.",Mountain Estate,87,14.0,Australia Other,Central Ranges,,Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon,Inkberry
60176,Chile,"A little herbal and green-ish, but not too much so. The nose has varietal aromas of pepper, bramble and oregano, but the palate is smooth and medium in depth, with cola, licorice and creamy vanilla accents working off a solid core of plum. Finishes reasonably long and warm.",Las Mercedes Reserva Especial,87,16.0,Maule Valley,,,Carmenère,J. Bouchon

60179,US,"This wine is rich in tropical fruit, pear, green apple and lemon-lime flavors, but dry, with a touch of butterscotchy oak. Shows a deftly clean mouthfeel with fine, coastal acidity.",,87,16.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Brander
60180,Spain,"A lot of wood sits up front, and in back of that things seem a touch murky and lactic. Freshness and precision are not this wine's best attributes, but there is decent weight and body carrying berry, tobacco and vanilla flavors. Would be better with more purity.",Pomar de Burgos Joven,84,14.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Pomar Viñedos
60181,US,"They put all the bells and whistles into this wine, from new oak to sur lie aging. It shows in the creamy depth, yet the wine has an herbaceous, green peppercorn edge. It wants to be fruitier and richer than it is.",,84,20.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,White Oak
60182,Spain,"Hard-driving aromas of smoke and graphite drown out shy fruit, while in the mouth the flavors are more distant than ideal.

60183,Australia,"This virtually 50-50 blend comes across as a bit simple and chunky, but well made. It's sturdy enough to stand up to burgers and the like, offering modest cassis and berry fruit and a dusty finish.",,84,14.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz,Archetype
60184,US,"There could have been a very good wine here, but the fruit has a baked cherry pie flavor, like the gooey filling that drips out and gets caramelized in the oven, or maybe it's some kind of extra-charred oak. Whatever, it's a little too much of a good thing.",,84,24.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Brutocao
60185,Germany,". Light to medium in body, this wine's modest cherry fruit is largely submerged under a layer of smoky oak. Cola and coffee flavors dominate, ending on a tart note.",Jannin,84,46.0,Baden,,,Pinot Noir,Duijn

60187,South Africa,"Truly a unique Shiraz, with its smoky, leathery and black olive aromas, followed by flavors of black cherry and spice. While appealing overall, it has a slightly syrupy, raisiny quality and some roughness on the palate that distracts slightly from the flavors. This is not really a problem for fans of wines that push the envelope a bit.",,84,20.0,Western Cape,,,Shiraz,Hercules Paragon
60188,South Africa,"Round and upfront with flavors of grapefruit, mango and lemon, this will please fans of a denser style of SB. Because of its structure, it can stand up to heartier dishes and hold its own well against spicy cuisine.",Vintner's Reserve Sur Lie,84,15.0,Walker Bay,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Leidersburg
60189,Australia,"Smoke and herb aromas meet caramel and cherry flavors in this unassuming little Merlot. It's nicely creamy on the palate, and you could do a lot worse than if your local restaurant was offering this as its house pour for $6 per glass.",Bin 3000,84,10.0,South Australia,Limestone Coast,,Merlot,McGuigan
60190,US,"Black and red cherries are the flavors of this wine, which shows the problems of growing Sangiovese in hot California. Not only is the wine enormously high in alcohol—16.5%—but the variety's acidity remains. The result is a hot, tart and rustic wine, but one not without a certain country charm.",,84,24.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Sangiovese,French Hill
60191,South Africa,"The clove and leather on the nose of this Cab from Stellenbosch introduce it appropriately: On the palate flavors of plum and dark berry impress. There's good fruit here and the finish is long, but overall, the wine lacks some punch and one wants more of the juicy, lush character. This depends on your taste, though—fans of more subtle styles may enjoy it.",,84,23.0,Stellenbosch,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,La Motte
60192,Australia,"A decent effort at a fair price, Plantagenet's attempt to jump on the Pinot Noir bandwagon is a medium-bodied wine featuring cherry and chocolate aromas and flavors. There's some delicate dried grass or hay notes as well, while the flavors darken on the finish.",Omrah,84,15.0,Western Australia,Western Australia,,Pinot Noir,Plantagenet
60193,Spain,"Musky and leathery at first, with a hint of cough drop. And it never really gains its legs. The palate shows a pruny character along with some wayward acidity, while the finish is indifferent. Adequate but lacks elegance and appeal.",Pomar de Burgos Crianza,84,24.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Pomar Viñedos
60194,Spain,"As pink wine goes, this Tempranillo-Merlot is extremely forward, heavy and aggressive. The nose is loaded with raspberry and cherry aromas, but there's also alcoholic heat reflective of its 14.8% alcohol. In many ways this drinks like a medium-bodied red wine, meaning it's fuller and beefier than your usual lighter-framed rosado. Imported by Dana Importers, Inc.",Rosé,84,15.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo-Merlot,Prado Rey
60195,South Africa,"Earthy, leathery and peppery scents on this Swartland offering will appeal to fans of a more grounded Shiraz, and the flavors follow suit. Berry and tobacco layers are folded into smooth tannins, but the wine has structure. It's a little on the rustic side, though with a good barbecue the edge might be evened out.",Indalo,84,15.0,Swartland,,,Shiraz,Swartland
60196,Spain,"Baseball card bubble gum and leafy spearmint aromas shade dark, dusty fruit notes, while the tannic palate houses mildly tart cherry flavors followed by hints of sucking candy and finally coffee. Decent but a bit overoaked and out of sorts.",,84,17.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Rubiejo
60197,US,"Riper and certainly hotter than past vintages, this Oroppas, which is a Cab-Merlot blend, shows its very high alcohol in the raisins and prickly heat that dominate it. Decent in many respects, but not going anywhere, so drink up.",Oroppas,84,55.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,St. Clement
60198,South Africa,"The nose on this Shiraz is deep and opulent in character, wafting of mulberry, vanilla and oak, and the flavors are rich and integrated. The tannins are firm but the wine is elegant and enjoyable. An approachable Shiraz that will pair well with everything from grilled ribs to pizza.",,84,25.0,Stellenbosch,,,Shiraz,Umkhulu
60199,Australia,"Some producers are promoting Petit Verdot as a top performer in Australia's warm inland regions, but there have been mixed results. This blend is almost half PV, presumably the source of its bold black-olive aromas and crisp mouthfeel, partially balanced by the cassis and plum of warm-climate Cabernet.",Regent Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon-Petit Verdot,84,14.0,Victoria,Murray-Darling,,Cabernet Blend,Paiko
60200,US,"There can't be too many 2002 Merlots yet to be released. Here's one; it's as tannic and berry fresh as a younger wine. Flooded with cherry jam, cassis and spice flavors, it's fairly tough and gritty. It could age out in a couple years, but it's far from guaranteed.",Vache,84,40.0,California,Cienega Valley,Central Coast,Merlot,Pietra Santa

60204,US,"I've given mixed reviews to this winery's Barberas. Sometimes they seem rustic, sometimes they show promise. This one's on the rustic side. It's kind of sweet and raw, in a young Port way, and the high alcohol adds to the impression of sweetness.",Grand Reserve,84,39.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Barbera,French Hill
60205,US,"The '03 was a very good wine. This is less so, probably due to the vintage, which simply baked the life out of the grapes. The cherry and blackberry flavors are a little Porty and hot, although the wine is dry.",Ripken Vineyard,84,25.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Petite Sirah,Sheldon
60206,Spain,"Torres claims to be serious about Ribera del Duero, but early on the Celeste wines, made from purchased grapes, are so-so at best. The 2004 is a touch damp and leathery on the nose, with toasty dark cherries as the driving flavor. It's got some weight but it's also drying and oaky on the finish. Needs some fine tuning.",Celeste,84,22.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Torres
60207,Australia,"Smells attractive, with hints of vanilla and cocnut layered over toast and apple, and the flavors are in the same vein--apples and citrus, with a bit of an earthy, mushroomy note underneath--but this sample lacked the zip and crispness of a really top-flight sparkler.",Brut,84,,Tasmania,Tasmania,,Sparkling Blend,Stefano Lubiana
60208,South Africa,"Dark berry and trademark South African smoke comprise the nose and the flavors of this wine from this historic Stellensbosch producer, and while the tannins are soft, the wine has enough complexity to hold its own against heartier dishes. There's some exotic spice on the palate too, offering an interesting extra facet to the wine.",,84,27.0,Coastal Region,,,Shiraz,Blaauwklippen
60209,Spain,Pretty good except for some hardness and a touch of chemical that runs onto the finish. Along the way there are heavy aromas and rugged blackberry and dark plum flavors.

60213,France,"Under the ownership of Patrick Bernard (whose family also owns Domaine de Chevalier in the Graves), this estate produces good, solid wines.

60216,Spain,"Starts shy, but then reveals a smoky nose of dried cherries and freshly fallen leaves. Still fairly youthful on the palate, where plum and cherry flavors are braced by a ripping note of hickory smoke.

60217,US,"Starts with a blast of charry oak, and turns fierce in tannins and acids in the mouth, as well as searingly dry. Somewhere in there is intense black-cherry fruit.

60221,Spain,"An example of a well-made, lightweight red that puts clarity and freshness ahead of bulk and oak.

Finishes warm, tight and spicy.",Crianza,88,19.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Marques de Tomares
60222,US,"Fans of sheer volume will exult, but this wine, good as it is, is a bit overblown. It overwhelms with oak as well as berry flavor so ripe, it approaches chocolate-coated raisins. It is an interesting, well-made Pinot, yet would benefit from greater elegance and a lighter, defter touch.",Keefer Ranch,88,45.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lookout Ridge
60223,US,"Fascinating to compare this to Provenance's '02 Oakville Cab.

Gorgeous tannin-acid balance, and such a delicate mouthfeel.",Rincon Vineyard,94,48.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Talley
60265,US,"An amazing Pinot Noir, very serious stuff. Big, bold, dark and decadently rich. Oozing with cherry pie, mocha and oak, with gorgeously firm acids and a smooth, complex texture. Just outstanding. A bit high in alcohol, though.",Rosemary's Vineyard,93,62.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Talley
60266,US,"Most tasters loved the huge complexities of this ripe, dense young wine. They praised its massive cherry and cocoa flavors that flirt with overripeness, and the smooth, silky texture. Another taster, however, found it super-oaky and clumsy. Likely to soften and knit together with a few hours of decanting, or aging through 2007.",Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard,93,69.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
60267,US,"Paler in color than Miner's Rosella's bottling, and more delicately structured, but there's nothing shy about the flavors. They're richly intricate, a tapestry of red cherry, cola, rosehip tea, cinnamon, mocha, vanilla and smoky oak. Simply delicious, and so smooth, so fine in the mouth.",Garys' Vineyard,93,50.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Miner
60268,Portugal,"The great estate of Vale de Meão, established in the 19th century by Dona Antonia Ferreira, is still in the family hands. It has produced this intense, fruit powered wine which packs herbs, dark tannins and sweet wood flavors. It oozes concentration from low yields and great ageability.",,93,49.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Vale Meão
60269,US,"What a beauty, complex as heck. Starts off with meaty, beefy aromas floating above red cherries, vanilla, cocoa and smoke, and turns intensely rich and delicate in the mouth, offering waves of tart cherry, sweet rhubarb, rose hip tea and spice flavors. So silky and light, yet unstintingly focused. A real accomplishment.",Halleck Vineyard,93,54.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Tandem
60270,France,"91-93 Barrel sample. Rich, packed with superripe fruit and huge tannins, this wine still manages to keep elegance, power tempered with velvet: an impressive combination .",Barrel sample,92,,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château les Ormes de Pez
60271,France,"91-93 Barrel sample. Initially, this wine seems very soft, the ripe fruit just floating. But it is all suppressed at this stage, and suddenly you taste the tannins and the power that is held back.",Barrel sample,92,,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Magdelaine
60272,France,"91-93 Barrel sample. This is impressive—a ripe, open wine, but showing some lovely, polished new wood flavors, vanilla and just a touch of spice.",Barrel sample,92,,Bordeaux,Pomerol,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château la Pointe

This is elegant while also being powerful.",Barrel sample,92,,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Phélan-Ségur
60274,France,"91-93 Barrel sample. A ripely juicy wine, with rich, intense black fruits layered with sweet-and-sour acidity. This is an immediately attractive wine, showing fine tannins, but with fruit dominating.",Barrel sample,92,,Bordeaux,Pomerol,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Clinet
60275,France,"91-93 Barrel sample. Juicy, fresh fruit, powerful black currant flavors and layers of obvious acidity. But there's more here: underlying, dark, brooding tannins, and vibrant fruits on top.",Barrel sample,92,,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pavie Macquin
60276,France,"91-93 Barrel sample. Solid, dry tannins, very firm and hard, but they are also ripe. The wine has high extraction, very dark fruit flavors, but resists being too huge. This could well turn out to be a very elegant wine.",Barrel sample,92,,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Rauzan-Gassies

60279,France,"Surprisingly good for its name, packaging and price, but that's why we taste the wines blind.

Cherry-berry flavors are fresh and fruity, with a moderately long finish.",,86,11.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône,,Rosé,Red Beret

60281,France,"Full-bodied and a bit heavy to make a delicate quaff, but pair this wine with the right summer foods (a juicy hamberger comes to mind) and it will work.

60285,US,"This extraordinary wine possesses an enormous wealth of black cherry, blueberry, cassis and espresso flavors, wrapped in fine, well-toasted oak. Has that rare quality of elegance, in which all the parts work together in harmony. Thoroughly dry, it's marked by a firm, astringent tannic structure now, but is a certain cel lar candidate. Should begin to blossom by 2008 and hold through 2015.",,94,70.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Caymus
60286,US,"Made mainly from vineyards in Green Valley, the wine was barrel fermented and underwent complete malolactic fermentation. The French oak barrels were 50% new. This level of intervention was appropriate to the underlying wine, which is massive in tropical fruit, pear, fig and melon flavors. The result is complex and lush.",Dutton Ranch,94,35.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Dutton-Goldfield
60287,US,"This very limited (600 cases) companion to the winery's Ethos Chardonnay marks a turnaround for Ste. Michelle's red wine program, as Bob Bertheau came on board just before the 2003 crush. The style is seductive, sharp and spicy; the tart fruits tumble out in a pile of mixed berry and cherry. Chocolate and baking spices add more flavors; the wine is seamless, smooth and long; the oak beautifully integrated.",Ethos,94,29.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Chateau Ste. Michelle
60288,US,"Abeja's John Abbott belongs on anyone's short list of Washington's most talented winemakers. This supple, dense Cabernet is restrained for the vintage, but lacks nothing in terms of power, muscle or complexity. Tar, smoke and gravel run right down its spine; tannins are substantial. But everything about the wine says class, and its compact confidence rewards patient tasters with layers of ripe, varietal flavor, perfectly matched to the oak.",,94,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Abeja
60289,Australia,"Abyss-black and adheres to the unwritten but well understood rule that Armagh must be big and bold, more appropriate for a passionate rendezvous than the dinner table. This vintage offers penetrating eucalyptus, white pepper, even meaty aromas. The palate is full and rich, dealing mixed berries, plum, eucalyptus and a hint of caramel. There are lasting, grippy tannins on the back palate, with notes of wheat bread and licorice on the finish. Drink through 2014.

60290,US,"You'll find this underrated producer offers wines with wonderful density and concentration, ripely balanced, plummy, mixed red fruits, and elegantly astringent tannins. There is real winemaking craft on display here, every detail beautifully rendered, substantial but not out of whack in any way.

60291,Hungary,"An amazing wine that is a benchmark for its class. Pure scents of dried apricot, citrus, jasmine and melon are coated with Asian spices, while the mouth is honeyed but nuanced, with flavors of dried spices, apricot marmalade and citrus fruits. What sets this wine apart is its mouthwatering acidity. A blend of grapes from multiple vineyards, this 26,000-case production wine is a steal at this price. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.",Aszú 5 Puttonyos,94,32.0,Tokaji,,,Tokaji,Royal Tokaji
60292,US,"Robert Young is one of Alexander Valley's greatest wineries. After others achieved success with their Merlot grapes, they started making their own wine, and consumers are the beneficiaries. Truly soft and voluptuous, yet richly structured, the wine is totally dry, with a dried herb edge to the cherry flavors. The complexity is enormous, but somehow the wine remains delicate and elegant.",,94,42.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Merlot,Robert Young
60293,US,"Keenan's 2002 regular is very good. The Reserve emulates all its fine qualities and far exceeds it in richness. This is a soft yet complex wine, rich in supple tannins, with extraordinary flavors of blackberry-laced espresso and pure, dark unsweetened chocolate. As dry as it is, the finish is as sweet as crème de cassis.",Reserve,94,56.0,California,Napa,,Merlot,Keenan
60294,US,"A superb follow-up to the winery's 2003 Milbrandt, it's the same 40/60 blend from Clifton and Sundance, both located in Washington's new Wahluke Slope AVA. A penetrating nose of cherries, violets, blueberries and black olives leads into a wine that masks its power with finesse. Licorice, tar and smoke wrap around the bright raspberry fruit core, with just a whiff of white pepper. Great winemaking, and a price point more wineries should emulate.",Milbrandt Vineyards,93,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Syncline
60295,US,"A bit more austere (for the moment) than the Champoux bottling, this has the vineyard's characteristically tight streak of mineral running through its core. Mixed scents suggest hay and pie cherries. There is plenty of substantial viscosity, but nothing heavy about the mouthfeel. This is sleek, deceptively light, tasting of stones, with soft hints of berry, good acids and nothing sharp or bitter.",Ciel du Cheval,93,33.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Soos Creek
60296,US,"Actually a Blanc de Blancs, since it's 100% Chardonnay, this is a wine of great purity, maybe because of the organic grapes. The bread dough, vanilla and subtle peach flavors have a very rich, creamy texture, without the jaggedness of ordinary bubblies. This is an important new addition to California's sparkling wine portfolio.",Brut,93,50.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Chardonnay,Jeriko
60297,US,"A full-on Bordeaux blend, with 61% Cab Sauvignon, 19% Merlot, 11% Cab Franc and 9% Petit Verdot. Tight and slatey, it's got firm, hard—but certainly ripe—tannins wrapped around concentrated cassis and mulberry fruit. It's very well made but can use some softening up; a few more years will add to its complexity and develop its bouquet.",Artist's Series #3 Red Wine,93,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Soos Creek
60298,US,"Michel Rolland consults on this extraordinary Merlot, part of Allen Shoup's Long Shadows project.

Still tight and young, this is a Merlot to savor, and to save.",,93,55.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Pedestal
60299,US,"Though it gets the same care as the winery's Cab, the Clos de Betz features considerably more Merlot in the blend (59% compared with 13%). This is intensely fragrant, beautifully integrated, toasty and lush. The mouthfeel is incredible, offering layers of caramel, butterscotch and creamy oak around black cherry and plum. There is even a hint of camphor and five spice for still more sensory overload.",Clos de Betz,93,32.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Betz Family

60303,US,"From a new appellation in Lake County comes this very interesting single-vineyard Syrah. At first it seems like a jammy flatterer, but then more complex layers kick in.

60304,US,"Baked apple pie is what this wine smells like, and the flavors are astonishingly the same, like an apple tart right out of the oven. It's not a particularly sweet wine, but the fruit carries with it a suggestion of sweetness, and there's a strong cinnamon spice component also. Might make a great companion to a non-sweet fruit tart.",,87,21.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Riesling,Methven Family Vineyards

60306,US,"A pale, pretty wine that's elegantly styled. It's a pleasure to encounter Pinot from Oregon that hasn't been placed on steroids, that isn't super sweet or the color of Zinfandel. In short, Pinot that looks and smells and tastes more like Burgundy. This is a very nice effort in that lighter style.",Northern Reach,87,27.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Southern Oregon,Pinot Noir,Brandborg

60313,Austria,"A delightfully refreshing and mouthwatering drink that's light in body but heavy on crisp, citrusy flavors accented by just enough green apple. It's great for the price as an apéritif.

60315,Argentina,"Aromas of light raspberry and cookie dough are a bit sweet, but taken together they are attractive. The palate delivers snappy berry flavors and plenty of tannic kick.

60316,US,"Really nice black currants and cherries, and classy tannins, too, the kind that are noticeable but sweet and soft at the same time. All in all it's a study in balance.

60317,US,"This is a great price for a blush wine of this quality and complexity. It's very dry, yet with a fruity sweetness of strawberries and cherries.

60319,US,"Vibrant red, this sparkling wine producer has crafted a silky, fine table wine with rich red fruit and a demure nose of cola and spice.

60321,Argentina,"A better overall ride than the more oaky Koch Cabernet, this bottling, aged 13 months in barrel, is crisp and fruity, with firm tannins that clamp down on the finish.

60322,US,"Difficult to assess. It's soft and a bit syrupy, but the texture isn't bad, and the cassis and chocolate flavors are impressive for their ripe lushness.

60324,France,"Starts with sweet scents of bread dough, light herb and green apple. Well-made, with lean, fresh flavors of apple and pear.

60325,Argentina,"Blackberry, tar and other dark notes coat the masculine bouquet, while cherry and cassis work the palate. This is a solid, big wine with structure; it's also fairly tannic and hard.

60327,US,"Lovely as usual; from one of California's finest Pinot producers, here's a wine with tons of cherry and cola fruit cruising on a silky, velvety texture.

60348,New Zealand,"A bit on the simple side, but lively, fresh and ultimately satisfying. Impressively pure black cherry fruit does pick up a hint of spice on the finish.

60349,Australia,"Smells like honey and talc powder, and shows Viognier's typical floral quality most in the mouth. It has the straw/hay quality that I associate more with Semillon, and a  flourlike feel. Less weighty than you expect a Viognier to be, too, but shows how nice the variety can be when made with a lighter hand.

60352,New Zealand,"There's 15% Sémillon blended into this wine, which helps add a bit of creaminess to the texture.

60354,New Zealand,"Nicely done at an affordable price, this wine starts off a bit slow, with tea and cranberry aromas leading the way.

Imported by Australian Wine Connection.",,87,20.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Forrest Estate
60355,US,"I like this wine for its voluptuousness, its creamy mouthfeel, and the long, pure flavors of cherries, chocolate and coffee.

60356,US,"This is such a wonderful value. It's rich in cherry, blackberry and cocoa flavors, and perfectly dry. Lives up to Merlot's soft, approachable reputation, but there's real complexity.

60380,Spain,"As a young wine, this is bold, dark, crusty and slightly out of joint.

60411,US,"Tight and tannic, this is a Bordeaux blend which leans to the herbal side of the line.

60435,Spain,"Having not seen the Valsacro wines for several years, it's nice to know that they are up to good things. This is a dark wine dominated by aromas of cassis liqueur and earth. It's lively and structured, with layers of toasted berry, chocolate and black pepper flavors. Shows a lot of shadings and trimmings, including creamy oak on the finish. Drink now and over the next two years.",,89,31.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Red Blend,Valsacro
60436,Spain,"Aromas of mineral and jammy raspberry are attractive, yet the palate seems a bit metallic and clicky, with hard to penetrate flavors of rooty fruits, vanilla, coconut and cola.

60437,US,"Very refreshing, this young, juicy Marsanne walks the line between citrus and green apple fruit flavors, nicely defined and clean as a whistle.

A lovely wine to explore with a variety of soft cheeses, pastas and seafood.",Destiny Ridge Vineyards,89,28.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Marsanne,Alexandria Nicole
60438,US,"Quite an impressive wine, especially from this prestigious appellation at this price. Dry and full-bodied, it shows black cherry candy, currant, herb, anise and cedar flavors, wrapped into finely ground, dusty tannins.

60439,France,"A hugely black-colored, single-vineyard wine, heavily extracted and oaked, along with superripe plums fruit flavors.

Age for 3–4 years.",Clos de l'Echo Cuvée Crescendo,89,85.0,Loire Valley,Chinon,,Cabernet Franc,Couly-Dutheil
60440,US,"Essentially the same blend as the outstanding 2006, the new vintage of DeLille's second red offers full, peppery flavors of currants and black cherries. You may wonder why fruit this good is declassified, until you taste the Chaleur Estate red.

60441,Portugal,"From vineyards at the western end of the Douro region, this is a densely packed wine, with a dusty and tannic texture that also keeps a firm grip on dark berry and stone fruits. The acidity is less apparent, giving a wine that should be drunk in the next 1–2 years.",Quinta dos Poços Grande Reserva,89,,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Douro Family Estates
60442,Italy,"This is a fine, elegant and linear Brunello di Montalcino with pristine and somewhat sharp aromas of spice, cedar, balsam and cherry cola.

60443,France,"Tannins dominate here, the fruit offering some bright support. The wine is certainly firm, although it misses some concentration.

60447,Italy,"Here's a thick and concentrated Brunello with meaty aromas of smoked bacon and air-dried beef. The fruit notes are on the mature, jammy side and there's also a hint of wet earth or white mushroom that is typical of Sangiovese Grosso in warmer vintages like 2005.

60458,New Zealand,"A wine of interesting contrasts, the 2007 Riesling from Omaka Springs takes the strident lime-sherbet and wet-stone notes often associated with dry Rieslings and marries them with an off-dry style. It's medium in body, with those minerally notes helping to balance the sweetness on the finish.",,87,16.0,Marlborough,,,Riesling,Omaka Springs

60461,US,"This is light and lightly herbal, an elegant take on the grape, and a good food wine.

60462,Chile,"Earth, smoke, leather and raspberry make for a pretty inviting bouquet, while the palate is fresh but mellow, with mildly tangy raspberry and cherry flavors.

60475,France,"Wood-aged Sauvignon Blanc is always a difficult balancing trick. This wine, the top cuvée from Château de Sancerre, doesn't quite make it, with the spicy wood dominating the lighter fruit.

60527,US,"This single-vineyard, single-variety bottling tastes like it was poured right out of the barrel. It sports the sort of firm, nuanced flavors that winemakers look for: clean varietal fruit with highlights of iron filings, gravel and pepper.

Easygoing and perfectly good. Even a touch rich and creamy.",Prosecco Brut Kosher,87,12.0,Italy Other,Italy,,Sparkling Blend,Bartenura
60534,France,"A full, very low-acid wine, thanks to the hot summer. To compensate, though, there are fine wood and tropical fruit flavors, which lend spice and an exotic element to the wine.

60538,Spain,"This well-priced red from Tarragona shows a glimpse of what the Montsant region can produce. The nose is all red fruit, with a splinter of oak.

Its nose deals a different fragrance every time you go back to it: nut, focused yellow fruit, cola, then fresh baked pastry.

The surviving grapes benefited from greater concentration, leading to a more intense wine.

60700,US,"A very good, immediately impressive Cabernet. We've never seen Chalk Hill Cab of this quality at this price.

60702,Portugal,"If you want power, here it is. This is a super-rich wine, with dense ripe black fruits. The concentration fits well with the acidity. The downside is a pepper and alcohol burn that needs to blow away.",Quinta do Soque Vinhas Velhas,89,,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Douro Family Estates

60705,Spain,"Some patience is required to plow through the early aromas of cherry cough drops, bitter chocolate and smoke, but once you make it past that the wine turns decidedly red and fresh.

60712,Italy,"Here is a beautiful and charming Rosso di Montalcino (the wine sometimes referred to as a “Baby Brunello”) with spice notes, toast and black mineral wrapped carefully around a core of cherry fruit.

60715,Argentina,"A typically huge Colomé wine with initial damp, murky, funky aromas that give way to earth, roasted fruit and compost.

60719,US,"A touch of barnyard funk gives this Pinot an old-fashioned Burgundian touch.

60721,Chile,"Starts with intense black-fruit aromas and dark, smoky accents as well as baked berries, licorice and meat. In the mouth, it's a bit clumsy and amped up, with big tannins, extract and a mouthfeel that grabs. Flavors of berry fruit and mint are good, while the finish bounces toward a loud finish.

60731,Australia,"Shows a dark, savory side of Shiraz in its aromas of blueberries, blackberries and black olives, then adds some espresso-like notes on the palate.

60906,France,"This is an exceptional wine, as is the vintage. The fruits—grapefruit, crisp red apple—balance with a fine yeasty character. There is a great depth of flavor, the fruits going in a pure line of freshness. The one problem is that it is much too young, the result of the demand from the market for the next vintage.

60908,US,"A fantastic Cabernet that stuns now for authenticity and power, and should develop for many years. Despite the large production, lower than that of many first growth Bordeaux, the wine, which has tiny amounts of Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, shows classic Oakville elegance and precision.

The mixed berries, red licorice, cherries, layers of butterscotch, toffee and caramel are beautifully integrated and linger seductively into the finish. It has some initial alcoholic heat, but the flavors compensate and go on and on. This is a wine that must be cellared another five or more years before it even begins to pull itself together.

It shows massive flavors of red currants, cherry pie filling, cola, figs and spices that taste like they were baked into a dessert pastry, except that the finish is thoroughly dry.

60919,France,"The purity of this wine is impressive. It has a straight line of mineral, flint and grapefruit running through it. Around this, there are layers of fresh apples, lime zest and a tight, taut structure. The one downside to what is a fine wine is that it, like many Roederer vintages, is too young. Give it 4–5 years.",Blanc de Blancs Brut,95,70.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Louis Roederer

60921,US,"This is the grandest of Melville's current trio of '06s. It's also the most ageworthy. Fifty percent stem inclusion in the fermentation has given the wine a tannic, gritty earthiness and spiciness that throw a cloak over the underlying wine.

This is a classic.",Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs Brut,95,,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Taittinger
60923,US,"The first sniff and taste tell you this is an important wine, but also a very young, tannic one. It's the structure, and not just the ripe flavors, that's so impeccable, giving the wine its backbone and strength. But speaking of flavors, the wine is gigantic in black currants and blackberries.

Flavors extend into and through an interesting, nicely textured finish.",,89,28.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ash Hollow
60954,US,"The fruit flavors remain primary, and the mouthfeel quite acidic. It tastes like not-quite-ripe blueberries and raspberries.

60959,US,"Goldeneye is a real vintage-dominated wine, and as delicious as the '04 is, it suffered from this hot harvest. The grapes got superripe in cassis and cherry flavors before the tannins resolved, leaving a hard mouthfeel. But there's no denying the deliciousness and Pinotesque silkiness. Drink now.",,89,52.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Goldeneye

60962,Italy,"Light. Light in color, light in body, light on flavor. What's there is pretty—featuring hints of peaches, mint and lime—so this is best as an apéritif. It runs the risk of being overpowered by food.",,84,12.0,Northeastern Italy,Delle Venezie,,Pinot Grigio,Torre di Luna
60963,Italy,"If you enjoy picking apart a wine--finding all of its tiny nuances and eccentricities--you'll find plenty here.

60964,US,"From the cooler Oak Knoll region of southern Napa, a wine with berry-cherry flavors and silky tannins. Yet it feels coarse and heavy, with a density and dullness Pinot Noir should not have.

60965,Chile,"This weighty Malbec is more rough than refined, but what's here is decent.

60973,Chile,"Rough at first, with leathery aromas and hints of bitter chocolate. Which all goes to say: Where's the snappy cherry fruit? It just doesn't seem to be here.

60986,Chile,"The nose is oaky and grainy as it offers aromas of corn and wheat as well as some pear fruit.

61050,US,"The first thoughts on this wine are how young it is, and how much potential it shows. The immaturity lies in the primary fruit, acidic character, like a big gulp of fruity cola. But the wine's awesome future is in its vast complexity and balance, and the way it dominates the palate and lasts and lasts. A blend of several vineyards, it's high in acidity, with massive cherry, pomegranate, rhubarb preserve, licorice, earthy mushroom and cedar flavors. So balanced and dry, so elegant and powerful, so silky and complex, it is quite simply a very great Pinot Noir, and an early indication that the vintage on the far Sonoma Coast may be the greatest ever.

61051,Austria,"This is the pinnacle of sweet wines at Feiler-Artinger. The name is right—it is the essence of all great sweet wines in one bottle. It is one of those wines whose taste lingers, but along the way, there is the most delicious wild flower honey, figs, pineapple, peach and nuts. They are beautifully woven together into a very complete wine, which needs only one thing: aging.",Ruster Ausbruch Essenz,96,58.0,Neusiedlersee-Hügelland,,,White Blend,Feiler-Artinger
61052,US,"Massive, complex, with amazing depth, an opulent, voluptuous wine of tremendous power and authority.

61053,US,"Most of the grapes came from the Annapolis Vineyard, with some from Seascape. While the vintage was cool, it gave incredibly long hangtime. Dry, crisp and delicate, the wine has a silky voluptuousness that makes it irresistible, with pie-filling cherry and black raspberry flavors finished with Asian spice. New French oak adds toast and vanilla sweetness. It's expensive, but still a bargain.",Land's Edge Vineyards,96,45.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court

61055,US,"Yes, it's a lot of money for a bottle of wine, and yes, it's stunning. From the famous Philippe Melka, this 100% Cab pours inky black, and smells dramatically oaked. No surprise that it's 100% new French barrels. But the underlying wine is massive in blackberry, cherry, mocha, lavender and thyme, just gigantically proportioned, and easily able to handle all that wood. Beautiful now, it's a keeper.

61060,US,"I quickly run out of superlatives for this spectacular wine. It is satiny and saturated with pure, clean Syrah flavors, the fruit dancing from plum to   mulberry to pie cherry, laced with smoke and white pepper.

61061,US,"Spectacularly ripe, showing an explosion of near-perfect fruit and smoky oak, balanced by crisply elegant acidity.

61068,US,"Ambullneo's most expensive Pinot has a statewide appellation, but they pride themselves as masters of blending. This wine, from their portions of vineyards in Solomon Hills, Bien Nacido, Hyde and Hudson, is eloquent. It's big, rich and flamboyant, almost Rhône-like, with cherry and raspberry pie-filling flavors, and the caramelized new oak that so spicily supports it.

61132,Australia,"A wine that was a contest entry, hence its name. It's rich, but a little hollow; as one taster says, it tries too hard. Aromas are of grape jelly, nutmeg and wheat bread.

The fruit smacks of cassis and a bit of boysenberry; the 80% new oak is barely evident. It's got the typical potpourri mix of flower and herb, not just the scents but also in the flavors.

61210,US,"Whether by virtue of vintage or bottle variation, Boudreaux wines seem to gyrate a bit wildly when first released. This new 2005 is no exception. At first sniff it explodes into life, the aromas a mix of herb, spice, tar, smoke, earth and fruit. Flavors are threaded together into a seamless, saturated whole—plum, cassis and cherry liqueur up front, earth and tannin right behind.

61217,US,"Has this vineyard ever produced anything less than a spectacular Pinot Noir? Hitching Post's '06 showcases its exotic spiciness and the way its power is modulated with an elegant structure. Cloves, nutmeg, allspice and white pepper are just a few of the spices that tantalize the cherry, orange and cola flavors. The wine feels wonderful in the mouth, rich and long-lasting. Ageable, too, with a window extending beyond 2012.",Cargasacchi Vineyard,94,42.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Hitching Post
61218,France,"Jacquesson is proud possessor of top quality grand cru vineyards in Avize. This vintage is subtle, a wine that takes a while to show all its richness, balanced with elegance.

61219,France,"Dry, almost toasty, showing maturity, this makes a great partner to Krug's nonvintage grande cuvée. Both have the same intense complexity of fruits, nuts, toast and richness. This rosé has just that extra element of taut tannins and a dry core to go with the ripe acidity.",Brut Rosé,94,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Krug
61220,France,"One of the grandest single vineyards in Champagne, an immensely steep south-facing hillside that dominates Mareuil-sur-Aÿ. From here, Philipponnat is able to produce powerful wines with toasty, ripe fruit, powered with yeast and flavors of hazelnuts and white fruits. While not as tense and without the aging potential of 1998, this is without doubt a great Champagne.",Clos des Goisses Brut,94,200.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Philipponnat
61221,US,"Exceptionally fine. Effortlessly combines the impressive power and authority the vineyard is known for with sensual elegance. The flavors of currants, cherries, cola, balsam and clovespice are mouth-watering. Such is the balance of tannins, acids, oak and all other parts that the wine should improve over the next six years, then hold for several more.",Estate,94,60.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Pisoni
61222,US,"Deeply flavored and impressive, this intensely young, Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend hails from Mount Veeder. It has all the hallmarks of a wine that needs time in the cellar. The sweetly extracted black currant and licorice fruit is massive, and so is the cedary oak, which is 80% new French, while considerable mountain tannins give a hard, astringent mouthfeel. Solidly in the modern Napa style, this opulent wine should improve over the next six years, at least.",Chapter Five,94,56.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ramian
61223,US,"A beautifully ripened Pinot Noir from a great vintage. Shows plush flavors of cherries, raspberries, pomegranates, blood oranges, cola and peppery spices that are wrapped into a rich, silky mouthfeel. This dry, complex wine is a joy to drink.",Dutton Ranch,94,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Rutz
61224,US,"Very full-bodied and rich, a densely structured wine that's too young to appreciate now. The cherries, raspberries, currants, roasted coconut, mocha frappuccino, date nut bread, candied ginger, orange tea and sandalwood are exotic and almost overpowering, but the wine never loses its tense control. Now through 2012, at least.",Melville Vineyard,94,42.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Samsara
61225,US,"Shows a control and nobility that's rare in California Viogniers, and you have to attribute that to the vineyard, as well as Ehren Jordan's winemaking skill. Dry and deftly oaked, the wine has a brilliant balance of acidity and fruit, with creamy flavors of peaches, grilled pineapples, honeysuckle flowers and vanilla-cinnamon. Just stunning in its intensity, one of the finest Viogniers in the state.",Alban Vineyard,94,35.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Viognier,Failla

61227,France,"Femme is Duval-Leroy's top cuvée. This, from the great 1996 vintage, is as much wine as sparkling experience.

The grapefruit flavor is only superficial, because behind this crispness, the wine shows considerable richness.",Cuvée Femme Brut,94,110.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Duval-Leroy
61228,France,"A beautiful orange pink color sets the scene for this intense rosé. It has maturity now, but certainly not old age, retaining great swathes of fresh red currant and grapefruit to go with the toast that is just showing. It is sophisticated and full-bodied, a wine that commands attention.",Dom Pérignon Vintage Rosé Brut,94,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Moët & Chandon
61229,US,"In a grand tasting of new Pinot Noirs from the appellation, this bottle stood out, even among its renowned peers.

61231,US,"This is very pretty and lightly floral, with lilac, sweet cream and bourbon barrel scents mixed in with the sweet cherry fruit. Right now the barrel flavors tend to overpower the fruit, giving the finish a hard, slightly alcoholic edge. With more time, fruit will re-emerge—it's quite pretty cherry flavored; clean and precise, polished but not at all fat or jammy.",Boushey,89,46.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Forgeron
61232,New Zealand,"After a slightly rubbery or tarry note when first poured, this wine cleans up nicely to present grassy herbal notes balanced by stone fruit. It's tightly focused and a bit more minerally than many NZ Sauvignon Blancs, without being overly tart or lemony. Should drink well through the end of 2008. Imported by Kobrand Corporation.",Te Muna Road Vineyard,89,23.0,Martinborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Craggy Range

61234,France,"Segonzac's wines are consistently good, and Heritage, the top label, performed well in 2003.

61235,US,"A Cabernet-based blend, with Merlot and Petit Verdot, this is a fruit-driven wine with masses of ripe black cherries, blackberries and raspberries, whose sweetness is boosted by fancy toasted oak. It shows a much-needed youthful grip of tannins that balances out the honeyed sweetness and grounds it.",Elevage,89,78.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Chimney Rock
61236,Australia,"A pleasant, well-made Shiraz, featuring mixed berry fruit and just a modicum of spice. Slightly richer and deeper than Two Hands' Bad Impersonator, but still not a heavyweight. Turns bright and crisp, with some raspberry flavors on the finish. Drink now.",Gnarly Dudes,89,30.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Two Hands
61237,New Zealand,"An interesting take on Pinot Gris, barrel-fermented in older French oak. The result accentuates the variety's smoky, nutty characters and adds heft and texture. Apple and honey flavors give it enough fruit to carry the weight, and the wine picks up pleasant spice notes on the finish. Drink now.",,89,23.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Gris,Staete Landt

61246,Spain,"A touch grassy and raisiny at first, but soon it gets into step and shows cleaner, fresher spice and cherry notes.

61247,US,"This is a really great price for a Sauv Blanc of this varietal purity. It's bone dry and crisp, with stimulating flavors of lemongrass, lemons and limes, figs, peaches and melons.

61250,US,"Firm and lush, the blend also includes 12% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon. This is a bigger, more expansive style than the regular Syrah, but still a fine value.

61251,Australia,"Wonderfully varietal Cab Sauvignon from a region that can sometimes lose some of the variety's characteristic herbal notes.

61252,Italy,"The nose is heavy and bold and delivers hearty notes of smoked ham, prunes, plums, spice and deep earthy shades.

61266,Argentina,"Good but a step down from recent vintages. Big and brawny on the nose, with oak-based aromas of shoe polish, chocolate mint chips and mocha.

61301,US,"This is a better wine than Maclean's '01, riper and richer. It shows blackberry, cassis and oak flavors, and a good structure. Still, it could use greater concentration.",,85,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Maclean
61302,Australia,"I've come to like Katnook's wines quite a lot, but this one is a disappointment. Though the wine has cool cherry fruit and black pepper aromas, it feels tired and weak on the palate.

61307,Australia,"Made by the folks at Frankland Estate, this Shiraz contains 5% Viognier, which didn't add the nuances that it typically does.

61313,Australia,"Offers sun-warmed, fresh golden apple and caramel aromas. Apple flavors come through as well but the texture is odd, like sawdust and mineral.

61321,US,"This is one of the larger, more imponderable Pinots I've tasted this year, meaning that it has the heft of something from the Rhône, perhaps a Grenache, although it never loses Pinot's silkiness. It's tremendous and forward in jammy cherries, raspberries and cola, and while it's dry, it has the sweet finish of an extremely ripe wine. Enormously complicated, it's an eccentric Pinot, but one you'll probably reach for again and again.

61322,US,"This is one of those superripe, superopulent, superfancy reds that makes tasters stop and pause.

61323,US,"Another beautiful wine from Gainey, a great producer whose Sauvignon Blanc comes from one of the best terroirs for that variety in California. The aroma is so invitingly rich in lemongrass, pineapple zest, Key lime pie and coconut macaroon that you almost fear it won't follow up in the mouth, but it does. Bone dry, rich, zesty and clean, it seems to have benefited from the coolness of the vintage, in the way the beautifully ripe fruit is accented by crisp, flinty acidity.

61328,US,"Always decadently opulent in blackberry, currant and chocolate fudge, the '03 seems softer than past vintages, and while it's probably not an ager, it impresses now.

61329,US,"A blend of 45% Merlot, 45% Cab Franc and the rest Cab. The wine is compact and tannic, but not over-built or chalky.

Intriguing and quite definitely cellar worthy.",Reserve,92,45.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Syrah,Stephenson Cellars
61331,US,"The talent at St. Supéry is evident in this lush, balanced Merlot. It has the famously ripe, forward fruit of a great Napa red, but shows the balance, harmony and complexity you expect when you fork over forty bucks.

Just the right amount of chocolate fills in the back end.",,92,32.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Grenache,McCrea
61333,US,"Oh what a nice young Cabernet this is. With lots of new French oak, it shows a beautifully balanced, elegant opulence.

61335,New Zealand,"This wine was a big award winner back in New Zealand, and it's easy to see why. It's full-bodied and rich but never heavy, with complex aromas and flavors that include cola and coffee, black cherries and plums, cinnamon and clove.

61342,US,"A very good followup to the excellent '02, the '03 is plush and ripe and ageable. With forward cherry, blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors, it offers plenty of opulence now, but has the tannic backbone to peak and then gradually fade for 10 years.

Unfortunately, just 25 cases were made.",Boushey Vineyard,91,23.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Wineglass Cellars
61382,US,"This has some real strength to the fruit, which shows depth, nerve and muscle. There's a nice high note suggesting citrus, even grapefruit; below that some racy berry fruit flavors; then comes the impact of tannin and espresso. It all adds up to some real excitement in the mouth. A powerful wine that zings the palate and leaves you wanting more.",,91,39.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Meritage,Three Rivers
61383,US,"Completely barrel-fermented, and it shows in the wine's lavish oak, ample weight and rich, oily texture. It's nutty and leesy, and much less overtly fruity than the winery's Russian River bottling, instead focusing more on weight and texture.",Quail Hill Vineyard,91,38.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Lynmar
61384,US,"The vineyard is an old one with a proud name, and the winemaker does it justice in crafting this dry, balanced wine.

There are dark fruits, but it's all shrouded in mystery.",Barrel sample,91,,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Clos de lé Oratoire
61387,France,"90-92 Barrel sample. Because of the high proportion of Merlot this is an opulent, sweet and ripe wine, more new world than Margaux.

61408,Hungary,"A sweeter and  rarer version of the '99 from Disznókö, this also has mouthwatering acidity that balances the wine.

61413,Germany,"Dr. Loosen's Kabinett wines sometimes approach the Spätlese level of concentration and flavor; this Spätlese could be someone's Auslese. It's decadently ripe, a rich mouthful of peaches, apricots, orange and pineapple, almost viscous and floral-honey sweet. Which is not to say it lacks acidity, structure or balance. Wonderful, spicy-sweet cinnamon and nutmeg accents offset the fruit, there's a somewhat grainy palate texture, like ultraripe pears.

It is dominated by the barrel flavors that only slowly meld into the massive fruit with extensive breathing time (36 hours after being opened the wine was still improving).",,93,75.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Quilceda Creek
61552,US,"Aloof now, this Cab holds you at a distance with its provocative tannins. But it's a very fine wine that shows real Napa pedigree. Balanced and harmonious, it features complex flavors of blackberries, cassis and cedar wood that turn sweet on the finish. Should be at its best between 2010 and 2013 and then slowly fade away.",,93,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Whitehall Lane
61553,France,"A Champagne that is very much wine.

61554,France,"You can tell that Pinot Noir dominates this wine. It is big, powerful, hinting at raspberries as well as delicious richness. There are white peach and pink grapefruit flavors, but the yeast and the layers of structured toast are just as intriguing. The final is a play on richness and structure.",Grand Cru Sélection Brut,93,55.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Pehu-Simonet
61555,France,"This is young, fresh, full and yeasty, with considerable richness. It shows the superlative quality of Charles Heidsieck as a Champagne producer.

61556,France,"Vintage 2002 is turning out to be a great year in Champagne, and this wine is a reflection of that. Made from the heart of the pressing, it starts crisp and creamy.

61560,Spain,"Opens with black fruit aromas, dry oak and spice.

61562,US,"Dark, toasty, and showing some bricking in the rim, this is ready to drink right now. If you like the more mature, softer tannins of well-aged Cabernet, this leads you there.

61563,US,"Previous Fish House whites were Chardonnay; now it's Sauvignon Blanc, which makes better sense.

61565,Argentina,"Starts with rubbery, intense aromas, but with breathing it settles on earthy berry fruit and oak-driven coffee.

61569,Spain,"A black wine with aromas of graphite, molten earth and black fruit. The palate is a pounder with strong tannins and blazing acidity, and that creates a mouthfeel with grating intensity and roasted black fruit flavors. Lively late, with herbal notes and a lasting tannic bite. At over 15% alcohol, there's a lot of fire and toughness, so hold for a few more years and hopefully the tannins will soften.",Reserva,88,25.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
61570,South Africa,"This robust SB starts with a nose of cut grass and gooseberry, followed by a complex, spicy array of tropical fruit and spice.

61577,US,"A serviceable white, with light lemony fruit—apple and jimaca It does not have the power of some riper Viogniers, but it is persistent, well-crafted, does not try to overdo it, and would be a perfectly fine accompaniment to a wide range of poultry and seafood dishes.

61580,Argentina,"Sweet and candied on the nose, almost like a jelly doughnut at first. But with airing it turns more savory, herbal and dry. Flavors of tomato, raspberry and herbs are robust and interesting, while the finish is less so as it flattens out and seems baked. Very good but needing a bit more spunk to rate higher.",Reserva,88,21.0,Mendoza Province,Maipú,,Syrah,Luigi Bosca

61587,US,"The Roussanne really shines in the blend, offering rich, ripe, soft, seductive aromas of peaches and apricots, then folding into a broad midpalate with no rough edges.

61592,Australia,"This is classically styled Australian Cabernet, which is to say it's not overly weighty or rich, opting instead for restraint and archetypal aromas and flavors of tobacco and cedar.

61605,France,"Quarts de Chaume, producing botrytized Chenin Blanc, should be one of the glories of the Loire. This example from Château Belle Rive, is only half there.

61610,Italy,"Here's a thickly concentrated red dessert wine with sweet aromas of blueberry, forest berries and Christmas spice. It has good intensity and a syrupy-dense mouthfeel that ends with a surprising blast of astringency.

61643,Argentina,"After an earthy, aggressive, almost sweaty start, this joint-venture red from Nicolas Catena and Eric de Rothschild finds its course and manages to improve.

The 2004 is no exception, a seamless, silk-on-steel compendium of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The wild card in '04 is the addition of 3% Syrah.

For starters, it's not an easy wine, as it's based on Carmenère and has Cabernet Sauvignon, Franc, Carignan and Malbec in the mix.

There is nothing at all subtle about this Syrah.

61716,France,"Already showing some bricking at the rim, this St.-Emilion from the owner of Château Pavie is altogether different from that storied wine. Starts with scents of raisins, smoke and leather, and continues in that vein on the palate, where the flavors run toward dried fruit and vanilla.

61717,France,"Another novelty white wine from a property better known for its Pauillac, the blend here is 40% Semillon, 40% Sauvignon Blanc and 20% Muscadelle.

61721,Spain,"Bulky and ripe, with raspberry and punch-like aromas. If you like sweet notes like kirsch, sugar beets and coulis, this has it.

61751,US,"With all the Merlot grown on Long Island, it's a shame there aren't more wines like this. Moderately priced, and well worth it, this wine delivers good dark-fruit flavors (blueberry, ripe cherry) and pencil shaving, a nice mouthfeel, and the bouquet of a wine twice the price.

This has the firm acidic base of Tempranillo, with immense extraction of color, tannin and plenty of bacon fat in the finish. It's full, almost fleshy, with texture and flavor.

61978,US,"Almost equal parts Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre from the estate vineyard. This is a real step down from Bone Rock, mainly because of overripeness.

61979,Germany,"A plump, off-dry Riesling imported in relatively large quantities (30,000 cases), this is a notable reintroduction to the grape variety.

61987,Spain,"Exhibits dry red fruits and mushroom on the nose, with accents of forest and spice. Somewhat minty and forward on the palate, and arguably a touch gritty and sweet.

62011,France,"Shot through with minerality, almost flinty, this wine shows its vintage well. The red fruit element is now only a small part of what is now a fully mature wine.

62015,US,"The assemblage includes seven grapes from ten vineyards and six AVAs.

62020,US,"Tasted in May, this Grenache-based Rhône blend was still overwhelmingly vibrant and fresh in grapey, primary fruit raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors. It's appealing, but really needs some time to settle down and mellow, so the fruit and oak can mesh together.

62021,US,"This best-of-barrels reserve shows a richness and complexity that make for compelling drinking. A mixture of several clones and selections of Pinot Noir, the wine has firm tannins, but the burst of cherries, red currants, root beer and sweet smoky oak gives it a supple, mouth-filling quality.

This is for food.",Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Brut,92,72.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Pehu-Simonet
62024,US,"100% Cabernet, this is very smooth and supple, a lovely wine, with darker, earthier flavors underneath the opening fruit. It shows the kind of elegance and grace one finds in Bordeaux, without intrusive barrel influences, and it's the kind of nose you want to bury your nose in. It wraps around you seductively, with an appealing shyness. The fruit and wood and earth flavors are seamless and interesting, as the wine leads you gently through a very long finish.",,92,30.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stephenson Cellars
62025,US,"Swanson has a great track record with this wine, which is always in need of time on release.

62030,US,"Craig's Howell Mountain Cab typically is powerful and ripe, with bigtime tannins that require aging. The 2005 is such a wine. Made with a drop of Merlot, it shows black cherry and cassis fruit accented with lots of toasty new oak. But it's really young, stinging the palate with astringency. Should negotiate the next 10 years with ease.",,92,80.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Craig

62036,US,"Perhaps because the winery's co-owner, Frank Ostini, is a restaurateur, he makes his wines in a forward, approachable style that doesn't require aging, although they're balanced enough for the cellar. The '06 Rio Vista is a fresh, silky wine whose smoky cherry and pepperspice flavors will soar with a grilled steak. Should hold nicely for six years.",Rio Vista Vineyard,92,42.0,California,Sta.

62060,Portugal,"Generally, 2004 is not a classic vintage Port year, but there are some very good ones around. This is soft, ripe and with good tannins.

62061,US,"This ambitious launch is from the owner of Laetitia. The grapes are from the Sierra Madre Mountains of eastern Santa Barbara County. Almost totally Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine is clean, balanced and dry, with an elegant structure. It's rather like a good Third or Fourth Growth. The next step is to build in layers of depth and complexity.",Santa Barbara Highlands Vineyard,88,50.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Nadia
62062,US,"Merryvale, as usual, was able to find success in the cold '06 vintage with Sauvignon Blanc. This wine is as dry as can be and high in acidity, and since the winemaker held off on malolactic fermentation, it's very crisp. That gives the lime, gooseberry and lemongrass flavors a great bite.",Starmont,88,18.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Merryvale

62067,Italy,"The nose is rich and opulent, but it is also very ripe—just shy of too ripe.

62068,US,"Soft and approachable, with 11% Cabernet Franc in the blend. The Franc stiffens up the backside, and adds some interesting aromatics to the front. It's a good ploy.

It bodes well for the future.",,87,9.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hogue
62069,US,"The vintage is looking to be pretty tough in the cooler parts of Sonoma due to the chill and dampness, but it benefits this dry blush wine made from Pinot Noir.

62080,US,"A very nice cocktail wine for its dryness and crispness. Although it's Chardonnay, it's not a big, rich wine, but a sleek, bone-dry one, with citrus and mineral flavors and strong acidity.

62082,Spain,"The nose of red fruits comes with oak, mocha and toast, while the palate is crisp and tight, with juicy, dry red berry flavors and backgroud notes of chocolate and spice.

62091,US,"A rich, layered Cabernet, with a deep core of blackberries, black currants and cedar, leading to a long, spicy finish.

It has floral, high-toned berry and plum aromas and more than a kiss of vanillin and cream. The palate is tight, a bit lemony and woody, with forward flavors of red fruits, cola and mint.

62152,France,"The Xavier Flouret range includes wines from both Spain and France. This expression of French Sauvignon Blanc is maturing well, its primary grassy character softened by flavors of almond paste, the acidity tamed but still pulsating through the wine. There is a good apple skin texture to add complexity.",Domaine Chatelain French Blonde,86,23.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Xavier Flouret
62153,Italy,"This is a light and elegant wine with lean consistency and delicate aromas of rose bud, Indian spice and wild berry.

62154,Chile,"The nose is dusty, with apple and banana aromas leading to a palate that's plump and tastes entirely of green apple and melon.

Drink now to capture the wine's remaining freshness.",Reserva,86,12.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Santa Rita

62156,US,"The nose is fruity and candied, with melon, apple, some sweet citrus. Some sweet cracker also; the finish is fairly quick and the acid (at 14% alcohol) is not really giving it the vivid structure you might expect.",,86,13.0,Washington,Rattlesnake Hills,Columbia Valley,Riesling,Hudson Shah
62157,New Zealand,"The entry-level Chardonnay from Kumeu River gives just a taste of what heights its Chardonnays can achieve.

62162,US,"This racy Cabernet is full of tart red fruits; its flavors are forward and lightly spicy. The wine seems to have been acidified, perhaps to provide some lift.

62163,US,"Dark, almost black cherry colored, this is an authoritative wine with concentrated layers of red and black fruits.

62164,Australia,"Tight and taut from the get-go, time in the glass not resolving the thick woody tannins that envelop the plum and blackberry fruit that lies beneath. Anise, curry spice and bread flour does come to the fore, though.

62167,Australia,"A puzzle. An excellent wine with an excellent reputation from an excellent vintage, but one that we felt didn't quite live up to some of its past incarnations.

62177,US,"Off-dry, with bright acids, this viscous and gloriously peachy Chenin reminds me of why I love this sadly neglected grape.

62178,US,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is a more subtle, and more interesting wine than the winery's Cab Franc.

62179,Australia,"Winemaker Noel Heidenreich's Shiraz is compelling, not overwhelming, with some vanilla flavors framing juicy red plum and raspberry fruit.

62180,Australia,"A crisp, cool style of Shiraz—if you think “eucalyptus” equals “medicinal,” this probably isn't your cup of tea. But there's a lot to like about this wine's gumtree, black pepper and blackberry aromas, and the way that its earth-clay feel steals the show on the palate. Has blueberries and blackberries at its core, and a dusting of cinnamon arund the edges. Crisp and lasting on the finish. Imported by Pan Pacific Wines.",Grand Reserve,90,55.0,South Australia,Wrattonbully,,Shiraz,Pepper Tree

62182,Argentina,"A bit of marmalade and violets accent the bold, dark nose. Not at all subtle, with syrupy berry flavors offset by a whack of bitter chocolate.

62244,France,"84-86 Dry, dense, concentrated and tannic, this wine is hard and dark. There are hints of fruit, but it seems to have too much over-extraction.",Barrel Sample,85,,Bordeaux,Haut-Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Coufran
62245,Italy,"Apple and green herbs on the nose are more convincing than the flavor profile, which deals applesauce and buttered toast. Fairly weighty on the palate, but clean and correct as a whole.",Cuvée Vino Spumante Brut,85,18.0,Italy Other,Italy,,Sparkling Blend,Foss Marai
62246,Italy,"Simple red fruit from the berry and plum family defines the nose, which is a bit herbal as well. Black plum and raspberry flavors are tight, lean and juicy due to lively acidity. Turns a little green in the midpalate as the fruit thins. Good for everyday drinking.",Piancarda,85,13.0,Central Italy,Rosso Conero,,Montepulciano,Garofoli

62248,Spain,"Lean and woody, with mint, herbs and sawdust on the nose. The palate is surprisingly saturated and healthy, with pepper and vanilla running side by side with dry cherry and raspberry. A bit scouring and tannic.",Crianza,85,14.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto del Pais,Torres de Anguix
62249,US,"Though Klipsun is widely regarded as an iconic vineyard for Washington, this wine smells more of raisins and prunes than of fresh, ripe grapes. The flavors are broad, baked and pruny; yet the tannins remain a bit green and chalky. The wine doesn't knit together and seems unlikely to do so in the future.",Klipsun Vineyard,85,55.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Austin Robaire
62250,France,"This family-owned grower is based in Jouy-lès-Reims at the western end of the Montagne de Reims. The two brothers, Pierre and Philippe, have produced a soft, balanced wine from premier cru vineyards, which is tantalizingly poised on the knife edge between freshness and richness. Apples and cream flavors round the wine very satisfactorily.",Premier Cru Brut,92,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Aubry
62251,US,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated Bordeaux blend is the winery's top red, and in the warm vintage of 2004, they've produced a balanced, rich wine that needs time. It shows classic flavors of currants, chocolate, sweet tobacco, herbs and cedar, but the tannins are fresh and arch. Should develop gracefully over the next 10–12 years.",Cyrus,92,55.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Alexander Valley Vineyards
62252,US,"A very nice wine, lush and drinkable, that demonstrates not only the pedigree of its vineyards (Stolpman and Thompson), but also the deft approach of the winemaker. Soft and juicy, it offers layers of crushed cherry, cassis, red currant, licorice, beef jerky and black pepper flavors, wrapped into rich, fine tannins. Drink now through 2010.",,92,34.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Grenache,Jaffurs

62254,US,"Shows the richness and fullness of body that this cool region of Santa Barbara is known for in Pinot Noir. The wine exhibits the twin elements of complexity and ageability. Somewhat tannic now, it's flamboyantly flavored, with a mélange of cherries, black raspberries, red currants, cola, licorice, Asian spices and smoky oak, and is very dry. Best now and through 2012.",Calmant Creek Vineyard,92,49.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,La Fenêtre
62255,US,"Lush and immediately attractive, this Pinot seduces the palate with ripe berry, cola, herb tea, vanilla and spice flavors and lots of toasty oak. It's a silky wine, with a fancy structure that calls for fine food. But it's also young, with a precocious feeling. Try holding until 2010, and it should develop through 2015.",Thirtieth Anniversary Vintage Selleck Vineyard,92,75.0,California,Mt. Harlan,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Calera
62256,US,"A very good Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux blend from Agustin Huneeus. While it would not be true to say it's a second wine of Quintessa, it does show the balance and integrity of that bottling, with a firm structure and dramatically layered black currant, mineral and cedar flavors. Will undoubtedly age. Best now through 2011, at least.",,92,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Faust
62257,US,"Less jammy and forward than the '04 Elevage, but more closed and tannic than the winery's regular 2005 Cabernet, this Bordeaux blend really needs time to show its stuff. It has obviously deep and impressive currant and blackberry flavors, but the tannins are significant. Hold until at least 2010.",Elevage,92,78.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Chimney Rock
62258,France,"A full, ripe creamy wine with a fine balance between fresh red berries and pink grapefruit crispness.

This is already delicious, but could certainly age over several years.",Vintage Rosé Brut,92,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin
62259,France,"Taittinger's delicate, elegant style shows well in this beautifully balanced rosé. It moves towards very dry, giving flavors that are of pink grapefruit, along with toast and hazelnuts. The integration for such a relatively young wine is already there, and this is not a wine for aging—a reflection of the heat of the 2003 vintage. But for now, this is what a great rosé should be.",Comtes de Champagne Brut Rosé,92,,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Taittinger
62260,US,"Winemaker Tim Stevens' dark, subtle, beautifully proportioned wines glide across the palate like Apollo Ono dancing with the stars. The cool site brings out some of the floral and citrus accents often missing from Merlot, and the darker cherry and plum fruit flavors fill in right behind.

62261,US,"This is every bit the equal of, if not even a bit better than, the outstanding 2005 Novelty Hill Sauvignon Blanc. Here is the same mix of racy, bracing tropical and stone fruit flavors, nicely matched to toasty flavors of almonds and biscuits.

62262,US,"The vineyard is up in the Mayacamas between Spring Mountain and Sonoma Valley, and the wine shows quite a bit of power. Coming from this hot vintage, it's also very ripe and fruity, in a California way. But it's classically structured and dry, and the tannins are softly complex.

Its freshness promises aging potential.",Spécial Club Premier Cru Brut,92,84.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Pierre Gimonnet et Fils
62264,US,"Cab Franc is often chewy, tannic, herbal, but rarely luscious, as it is here.

62265,US,"A lovely Otis, now rounding out and showing pretty dried herb character throughout. There is a pleasing sweetness to the core of cherry/plum fruit, elevated with baking spices and lingering softly into the finish. The wine actually gathers strength in the back, adding in layers of caramel sprinkled with black pepper and dried sage.

62266,US,"The wine is still showing a lot of rich new oak flavors: toast, coconut and vanilla crème. Sur lie aging (in 100% French oak) adds plenty of texture and the impression of minerality.

62267,France,"This blend of Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Petit Meslier, Arbanne, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay must be one of the most complex blends in Champagne.

62270,US,"A lovely, fresh wine, relatively pale in color with orange-ruby notes, and far lighter in body than most other Central Coast Grenaches. There's a Pinot Noir-esque quality to the silky delicacy. Flavorwise, it's all about cherry, cola, raspberry, Mandarin orange tea, smoky vanilla, Asian spices and white pepper. A savory, distinctive red wine with just a touch of oak.",,91,38.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Grenache,Margerum

62275,Italy,"Cesari's lush Amarone is particularly good this vintage.

62276,Argentina,"A bit warm and ripe at 15.5%, but the nose of prune, raisin and blackberry is rich and only gets better with airing. The palate features tobacco and savory black fruit, and the finish runs for miles with chocolate and licorice. Despite its weight, there appears to be ample acidity to protect the wine's integrity.

There are lively green fruit flavors to finish.",Blanc de Blancs Brut,91,65.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Ayala
62279,Argentina,"Kaiken Ultra has emerged as a consistent top-shelf Malbec. This vintage shows power, purity, mineral, ripe fruit and well-applied oak. It's a generous wine with kirsch and raspberry parfait flavors. It almost makes it to creamy but by holding onto its core acidity it guards overall balance.

62281,Australia,"This comes out of the bottle a bit tarry and rubbery, so splash it around in a decanter a bit if you get the chance.

62284,New Zealand,"An interesting mix of frankly vegetal notes—green bean and asparagus—with ripe melon and stone fruit.

62291,US,"The winery's Cuyama River Pinot typically is very ripe and full-bodied. The trick is to achieve elegance.

62296,Spain,"Light and limpid, with mild almond, palm butter and citrus aromas. This is a basic, clean wine that offers citrus, pineapple and mango flavors.

62298,Italy,"The wood tones are very evident although vibrant fruit notes are not totally masked: You'll encounter cherry, forest berries and a very pleasing blast of menthol freshness.

62301,US,"Tastes unevenly ripened, with a thyme and peppermint jelly green quality side by side with blackberry jam and blueberry pie filling.

62309,Spain,"Earth, leather and mildly stewed aromas greet you, and right away one can tell this wine came from a warm vintage. It has integrity and depth but maybe it still couldn't escape what 2003 threw at it. Why do we say that?

The palate has snap and smacking tannins, with flavors of raspberry, cherry and a staunch buttery dryness. Brambly but with enough good fruit and body to make the cut.",Reserva,87,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,El Circulo
62327,US,"This is a brisk, clean wine, marked by tart acidity that scours the palate and prepares it for food. The followup flavors are of spicy tropical citrus fruits and green, savory gooseberries. The grapes are from a coolish vineyard near Santa Rosa.",Kick Ranch,87,25.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Enkidu
62328,US,"Shows the crisp, natural acidity of this cool-climate appellation, with ripe flavors of red and black raspberries and red cherries, accented with sweet oak. Very nice, very fine, although it would benefit from extra complexity at this price. But drinks beautifully elegant now.",,87,30.0,California,Arroyo Seco,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Mercy
62329,Argentina,"This is probably the best of the new line of Festivo wines from Monteviejo. The nose has a clean, fresh neutrality that serves it well, while the palate is bright and offers apricot and nectarine flavors. Turns more pithy on the finish, which is why we suggest that you drink it ASAP. Questionable value at $18.",Festivo,87,18.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Rosé,Monteviejo
62330,South Africa,"An alluring nose of black cherry, cedar, cinnamon and anise leads this friendly, ageable Cabernet.

An elegant sip suitable for lamb, beef or aged cheeses.",Fantail,87,22.0,Stellenbosch,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Morgenhof
62331,US,"Quite an impressive wine, especially at this price. A blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon without much oak, it's an interestingly complex white, with good weight and density and intricate flavors of citrus fruits, apricots, peaches and lemongrass. Finishes totally dry, although the acidity is a little clumsy.",Kismet,87,21.0,California,Bennett Valley,Sonoma,White Blend,Frostwatch
62332,Spain,"A clean, easygoing style of Albariño with salinic aromas along with apple and peach.

62334,Italy,Enzo Tiezzi from the Podere Soccorso farm in Montalcino has crafted a rich and luscious wine with drying mineral tones backed by fresh berries and raspberries. It's an easygoing wine that would pair with most pasta dishes.,,87,15.0,Tuscany,Rosso di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Tiezzi
62335,Spain,"A mature, more traditional Spanish wine that's ready to drink.

Caramel, vanilla and toast notes grace the finish.",Reserva,87,11.0,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,,Tempranillo,Viña Albali
62336,Australia,"Squarely in the fruit-forward, über-ripe camp, the Nugan Shiraz is a very good example of the style.

62339,Spain,"Roasted berry, marzipan, prune, spice and earth are rolled into a solid whole on the bouquet, while the palate rides on the heavy side with grating tannins and deep but clumsy flavors of blackberry, raisin and fruitcake.

62340,Germany,"A nicely complex nose of apple, lemon and herbs gives way to a dry, smooth mouth full of grape flavor. An even, if slightly thin mouthfeel and smooth finish wrap it up nicely.

62342,US,"This light delicate wine comes from warmer parts of Napa Valley, including Calistoga and Pope Valley. The aromas suggest lemons, limes and buttery smoke, and so do the flavors.

62354,Chile,"The smoke and menthol-toast aromas from new oak run alongside grass and green hay. The fruit flavors are light, but tend toward black cherries.

62361,Germany,"This rather rustic wine in a round wide ""bock"" bottle has a round mouthfeel, simple and earthy aromas and flavors. But a ripe, fermenting-hay note begins on the nose, continues into the mid-palate where it becomes a musty mature element on the straightforward grape flavors. Still, it might work with sausages or other country fare.",Qualitätswein,82,12.0,Baden,,,Riesling,Stich den Buben

62373,US,"A limited-production (183 cases) wine from the estate vineyard. It's a supple, smooth, solid effort, not as substantial as their other Syrah, yet far pricier.

62374,Portugal,"The Symington family continues to make strides in their table wine production.

62384,US,"Here's a raspingly tannic, high-acid wine that feels astringently dry at first. Then the cherry flavors kick in, and all sorts of complexing herbs, spices and oak influences.

62407,Chile,"Fairly earthy and a little bit herbal on the nose, with aromas of tomatillo, oregano and light fruit that almost amount to a nice salsa fresca.

62409,France,"Emphasizing the stalkiness of Cabernet Franc, with some smoky flavors and tight, dry tannins, this wine needs a few more months to bring out the berry fruits underneath. The balance, though, is potentially good, with fine fresh acidity.",,86,16.0,Loire Valley,Chinon,,Cabernet Franc,Remy-Pannier

62414,Italy,"This is a simple red wine from the Mediterranean island of Sardinia that delivers ripe aromas of mature blackberry, prunes, plums and candied fruit. The wine is executed in a simple style—with an emphasis on the fruit and oak aging—and closes with bright berry flavors.",Jaccia,86,24.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Monica di Sardegna,,Monica,Meloni
62415,Chile,"Early rubbery aromas give way to purer black-fruit notes. The mouth is generous and shows good feel and structure, while the flavors of blueberry and blackberry are simple to like, modestly sweet and generally quite ripe. Decent length and spice on the finish close it out nicely.",Santa Digna Reserve,86,11.0,Central Valley,,,Merlot,Miguel Torres
62416,US,"Tart and dry, marked by sour cherry acidity softened a bit with cedar. The silky texture is nice, as is the low alcohol level. Drink now.",Grand Firepeak Cuveé,86,38.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Baileyana
62417,US,"This spicy and dusty Rhône-Ital blend comes with a little bit of everything: 40% Syrah, 38% Grenache, 7% Mourvèdre, 7% Primitivo, 4% Counoise, 2% Cinsault, 2% Barbera. Not too surprisingly, it lacks a bit of focus, but it's a good pizza wine, just a little diffuse.",Black Dot,85,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Domaine Pouillon
62418,US,"A sound everyday Merlot with lots to like. Dry and full-bodied, it shows flavors of blackberries, blueberries, plums and mocha, firmed by sturdy tannins. A good steak fajitas wine.",,85,10.0,California,California,California Other,Merlot,Dog House
62419,Chile,"Visión has good peach, apricot and other stone fruits on a largely quiet nose, while the palate is surprisingly spry and tangy as it tastes like lemon-lime and pineapple. Finishes long and acid-washed, so overall it seems zesty and jumpy.",Visión,85,15.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Viognier,Cono Sur
62420,South Africa,"Aromas of clove and spice start this assertive, easydrinking blend of Syrah and Viognier. Forward blackberry and cassis flavors mingle with oaky spice and sturdy tannins. Aromatic and friendly, the wine will pair well with lamb and beef.",Goat-Roti,85,20.0,Coastal Region,,,Syrah-Viognier,Goats do Roam Wine Co.
62421,US,"A little harsh, hot and peppery for a Pinot Noir, with cherry, smoke and spice flavors. But it could mellow out in a year or so, and certainly improves with airing in the glass.",,85,27.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Fess Parker
62422,Chile,"Slightly dusty and fresh smelling, with cherry/berry aromas that should ring familiar. The palate is zesty, tight, crisp and driving, although the fruit is anything but gigantic or exciting. With some kick and spice late, this is the definition of an everyday, no-fuss Merlot.",Reserva,85,10.0,Maule Valley,,,Merlot,Calina

62425,Chile,"Olive and herb aromas carry the bouquet, while the body and mouthfeel are big, bulky, a touch unfocused but definitely not miserly or wanting for power. Tomato and oregano are prominent flavors, and the tannins start to build right from the start. Solid as a block, but herbal like an old-school Chilean Merlot.",Armador,85,13.0,Maipo Valley,,,Merlot,Odfjell
62426,Chile,"A just-the-facts, bare-bones kind of Cabernet that delivers just enough fruit, balance and finish to make it fully worthwhile as a value special. The nose is complete but not complex, and that's pretty much the formula here. Flavors of red cherry and raspberry are simple but nice, and the finish is fresh and manageable.",Selected Terroir,85,10.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Ema
62427,Italy,"There's a pungent note here of overripe fruit or mature strawberry that takes away from the overall harmony and elegance of the wine. Instead, this is a workhorse Merlot with soft, chewy tannins and a thick mouthfeel that could match lamb in spinach curry sauce.",,85,8.0,Central Italy,Terre di Chieti,,Merlot,Spinelli
62428,Chile,"Mild asparagus and salinic notes are noticeable on the nose, while the palate is minerally and piercing, with green fruit, lime, herbs and citrus peel.

62429,Chile,"A little funky and sweaty, but definitely a live-wire white with tons of lime, kiwi, citrus and grapefruit flavors.

62432,Argentina,"The bouquet on this bold red amounts to one big blast of fruit, nothing more or less. The palate matches the nose, with black plum, blueberry and cola flavors. Broad in the mouth and fiercely tannic. Spirited but a little untamed.",,84,9.0,Other,Aminga Valley,,Bonarda,San Huberto
62433,US,"Wölffer Merlots are similar in style: high acidity and mild tannins on a light- to medium-bodied frame.

62434,Argentina,"Year after year I taste this wine, and it always seems oaky and short on fruit. That said, it's a balanced, serious wine from well-tended vines, and it's made by folks who care. If you take the plunge, look for coconut and vanilla from the oak and dry fruit with touches of tomato and herbs.",Q,84,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Tempranillo,Zuccardi

62436,US,"A lighter wine with tart acidity and moderate tannin. Brambly, fresh aromas of cranberry have green notes, leading to flavors much the same. Better with light cheese than steak.",,83,,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Merlot,Baiting Hollow Farm Vineyard
62437,Argentina,"Light up front, with slight floral and banana aromas. Flavors of lemon and apple are short and clean, while a tangy finish closes it out. Fairly big for Torrontes but not offering much in the way of character.",,83,9.0,Other,Cafayate,,Torrontés,Finca Koch
62438,Argentina,"This rosado is made from Bonarda and Malbec grapes. It's a touch vegetal on the nose, with hints of vanilla to sweeten it up.

62443,US,"The heat during harvest was just horrible, and seems to have impacted this Grenache-Mourvèdre blend.

62450,Argentina,"A typical New World Chardonnay in that it starts with corny aromas that are matched by heavy toast notes. Act two is an ultra sweet palate that seems more sugary than ideal. Very tropical as well, with sweet mango and pineapple flavors. Too sweet to be convincing as a dry white.",Reserve,83,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Chardonnay,Zolo
62451,US,"Crisp in acidity, ripe in cherry, cola and coffee flavors, and delicately tannic. Just a bit too sweet for balance. Has a sugary, soda taste that detracts and makes it medicinal.",Estate Grown,83,36.0,California,Marin County,North Coast,Pinot Noir,Stubbs Vineyard

62453,US,"From the oldest vineyard on Long Island comes this well-oaked wine. Fruit is missing from the bouquet, which has mint and spice but also nail polish and horsey notes. The flavors are on the weedy side, with tomato and sweet oak trying to cover. Still an okay wine, light-bodied and smooth, with high acidity. But definitely less ripe than better vintages.",Hargrave Vineyard,83,20.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Merlot,Castello di Borghese

62479,Spain,"Muddled to start, with chocolate and earth aromas along with heavy, seemingly chewable berry fruit.
