The wine also has youth on its side and could age for several more years. Drink from 2014.",,91,,Vinho Verde,,,Alvarinho,J. Portugal Ramos
12732,US,"Most Pinot Noirs would kill to have this depth of flavor. Although it's the winery's most basic, non-vineyard-designated Pinot, it's a fantastic wine, rich, mellow and delicious.

12747,New Zealand,"Americans Claudia and Mike Weersing's estate vines are grown so close to the ground, they look almost like a bonsai vineyard. Made as naturally as possible, it's yielded a smoky, savory style of Pinot Noir that shows some dark plum and black olive fruit and a lingering, slightly chocolaty finish.

13357,Spain,"Smells like air freshener and white flowers. The palate is spongey and a bit low on life, while the flavors lean toward citrus but lack purity and zap, which is further drilled in on the waxy finish.

Defines the Heidi Barrett style of big, ripe, exuberant fruit and a classic structure, enhanced in this case by the firm tannins and fine acids of Atlas Peak.

Nice with grilled shrimp or mushroom and asiago cheese risotto.",,87,12.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Moon Mountain Vineyard
14736,Spain,"Stolid and compact on the nose, with generic berry aromas. The plate has a tannic stickiness to it, while the flavors veer toward jammy blackberry.

14758,Australia,"At this score and this price, it's a shame there isn't more of this bargain to go around (only 850 cases were imported).

14790,US,"So softly delicious, so complex and sensually satisfying, this Bordeaux blend, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon and contains all the other classic varieties, is truly a wine to savor.

14801,US,"A great success for this bottling. With extraordinarily high residual sugar, the wine is very sweet in wild honey, infused with the essence of oranges and apricots, folded into rich, buttery custard, and sprinkled with vanilla sugar and cinnamon.

14802,US,"This is a Pinot Noir meant to be aged. No question about it, from the citrusy acids to the sandy tannins to the somewhat awkward primary fruit flavors that desperately want to resolve with the oak.

14804,US,"A dry wine, companion to the winery's off-dry estate bottling. This does not give up its fruit as some dry Rieslings do; there is a pleasing mix of lemon, grapefruit, pineapple and apricot, full in the mid-palate, then turning more astringent and cheerily tart in the finish.

Enjoyable now, it could show more balance and finesse in 2–3 years.",La Forge,93,75.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Corbières-Boutenac,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Gérard Bertrand
14811,US,"Here's a beautiful Pinot Noir to drink now with upscale fare, like steak, lamb chop or grilled ahi tuna. It's silky and dry and feels excellent in the mouth, with complex raspberry, cherry, cola and smoked meat flavors, sprinkled with cocoa powder and cinnamon. Delicious.",Laguna West,93,39.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Fog Crest
14812,US,"The best thing about this Chardonnay is the acidity. It's brisk and clean, and gives a zesty finish to the extraordinarily rich pineapple, papaya, lime and Meyer lemon flavors that are almost sweet, but aren't. A firm scour of minerals adds the necessary grounding to this complex wine. Drink now–2013, but not too cold.",Pastorale Vineyard,93,100.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Freestone
14813,US,"There's a feral quality to this wine, with its flavors of wild forest berries, red currants, cola, spicy smoked meats, tangerine zest and sandalwood, and hints of pine cones, rosemary and thyme. It's big and dry and, although silky in the mouth, tannic. An impressive young Pinot Noir that should be cellared for 5–6 years, at least.",Wildcat Mountain Vineyard,93,45.0,California,Los Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Talisman
14814,US,"This gorgeous new release, from a young winery with a Riesling focus, is resplendent with an enticing mix of flowers, fruits and stone. The scents well up from the glass and the flavors fill the mouth with a lively zest, pulling together streaks of lemon, lime, nectarine and apricot, accented with citrus rind and wet rock, honey and lemon tea.",Estate,93,24.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Riesling,Trisaetum
14815,US,"Just delicious, this wine shows its pedigree from some of the best vineyards in the valley, including Merryvale's St. Helena estate. Dry and rich in firm but refined tannins, it offers elaborate flavors of blackberries, blueberries and cherries, while 70% new oak adds layers of buttered toast and caramel. Great for drinking now with the best meats and cheeses you can find.",,93,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Merryvale
14816,US,"Silhouette is Merryvale's small-production best of barrels blend from the winery's various vineyards. The '08 is a success, showing brisk acidity and new oak and yeast flavors and a creamy texture framing ripe pineapple, pear and mineral flavors. It's an elegant wine that shouldn't be served too cold.",Silhouette,93,55.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Merryvale
14817,Austria,"A complex, concentrated wine. It shows richness as well as tense minerality, the ripe black berry flavors melding with firm tannins. Alte Reben is old vines,  impressive and designed for aging.",Alte Reben,93,35.0,Burgenland,,,Austrian Red Blend,Weninger
14818,Austria,"Impressively compact, complex wine. It has rich flavors of peach, spiced pear to go with the intense acidity that is under the full-bodied surface. It should be aged three years or more.",Grande Reserve,93,,Niederösterreich,,,Grüner Veltliner,Forstreiter
14819,US,"A beautiful, elegant and dramatic blend for drinking now and over the next 6–10 years. Based on Cabernet, and sourced from vineyards including Beckstoffer ToKalon and Showket, it's flashy in blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors, with gorgeous, refined tannins. It's throwing some tannins, so you might want to give it a proper decant.",Oakville Grade,93,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Merryvale
14820,US,"Few Cabs on earth are riper than this, with its enormous flavors of black currants, cherry-pie filling, plum jam and chocolate that overwhelm the mouth with decadence. It's modern in tannins, which are soft and finely ground, and opulent in smoky, spicy new oak. It is, in short, the very model of a Napa cult Cab.",,92,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Palmaz
14821,US,"The Mendocino winemaker, Dennis Patton, who's a real veteran, made this extraordinary wine. A blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Grenache and Syrah, it's one of the best Rhône-style, field blend-type wines of the vintage, showing lush raspberry, cherry, cassis, gingerbread and herb flavors. A tannic taste of bitter almondskin rounds out the finish.",Coro Mendocino,92,35.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Red Blend,Fetzer
14822,US,"A delicious sparkler; shows the delicacy and elegance of a blanc de blancs at its California best. The Chardonnay contributes subtle peach and citrus   flavors, and the mousse, or bubbly mouthfeel, is very refined. Should age well. Drink now–2009, at least.",Le Rêve Blanc de Blancs,92,75.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Domaine Carneros
14823,Australia,"Despite carrying a lofty 16% alcohol level, this wine doesn't seem the least bit hot. Instead it's creamy-smooth and full-bodied, with aromas and flavors of brown sugar, blackberries, vanilla and some savory, peppery notes for added complexity. Then it finishes long as well, folding in hints of spice cake. Drink now.",,92,25.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Inkwell
14824,US,"This is a complicated young Pinot; and while the parts are all pretty and polished, they haven't knitted together. Voluptuous flavors of cherries, cola, spices and cedar are wrapped into silky tannins, and the acidity is fine and brisk, but as good as the wine is, it seems unfinished, like the score to a symphony that has yet to be played. Give this until mid-2008, and it should be terrific for the next four years.",Nicole's Vineyard,92,50.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,J Vineyards & Winery
14825,US,"The 2005 has been co-released with the 2006. The '05 is a better wine, probably due in part to the extra year of age, which has allowed the parts to come together harmoniously. It continues a multiyear streak of being one of the top Chenin Blancs in California. The main feature is dry acidity. It frames apple, citrus, peach and flower flavors, with a nutty, slightly bitter finish. Try as an interesting alternative to Sauv Blanc.",Ernesto Wickenden Vineyard Old Vines,92,20.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chenin Blanc,Foxen
14826,Italy,"A fine example of a Barolo, and a marvel considering the problems of the 2002 harvest.

Selections, LLC.",,92,49.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Giribaldi
14827,US,"Made primarily from Pinot Noir with a little Chardonnay, this has a subtle color of the first blush on a peach, and is fragrant and delicious. The fruit flavors of raspberries and cherries have a lime tinge, and the finish is dry and impressively long. Really easy to like, just filled with charm and finesse.",Brut Rosé,92,42.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Gloria Ferrer
14828,Italy,"A beautiful, complex wine, it begins with dense aromas of dark jammy fruit, anise, wax polish and leather. The palate is well balanced and the flavors are intense and have evolved well. The finish is medium long.",Serralunga,92,44.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Palladino
14829,France,"The fact that this wine comes from the chalkiest of soils and is bone dry gives it considerable austerity. It is definitely mineral in taste and texture, with a touch of salt and grapefruit flavors;  very structured and tight. It needs to age.",Minéral Extra Brut,91,60.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Agrapart & Fils
14830,US,"A deliciously vibrant wine, with oak-inspired citrus peel, peach, fig and creamy honey-vanilla flavors. However, as succulent as it is, from such a great winery, it could be far better.",Soliloquy,91,25.0,California,Oakville,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Flora Springs
14831,Austria,"Despite its high alcohol, this wine manages to preserve its balance. That's because the Grüner acidity creeps through the weight. With his top wine, Ehmoser goes for a tropical fruit profile here, with mangos on top of vanilla and spice. There's structure too, which suggests this powerful wine could age for 2–3 years.",Aurum,91,38.0,Wagram-Donauland,,,Grüner Veltliner,Josef Ehmoser
14832,US,"This is a distinctive Chardonnay, with pea vine and peach, anise and apple mixing it up. It has a lovely, lifted elegance that keeps the flavors intertwined but allows you to experience them separately as well, and it carves a flavor trail through the finish that lingers sensuously. Could be the best CV Chardonnay ever from L'Ecole.",,91,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,L'Ecole No. 41
14833,US,"Well made, this is a sappy, snappy take on Syrah, with vivid wild berry fruit and lively acids. It snaps into focus right away, then slowly softens as it weaves through the palate, with mixed berries, rhubarb, plum and hints of citrus. The finish lasts a full minute, adding notes of black pepper as it fades. This is beautifully rendered and not overblown in any way, with the alcohol at just 13.5%.",Estate,91,35.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Smasne Cellars
14834,France,"Ripe grapefruit, green plums and other green stone fruits all show that this wine has some weight, allied with a steely interior. Still young, it fills the mouth with yeast and some toast, but more of an intense freshness.",Premier Cru Brut,91,,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Pascal Doquet
14835,New Zealand,"The Saint Clair style usually features prominent herbaceous notes, but this special block bottling tones down that influence, instead relying more on melon, fig and mineral notes for impact. It's full-bodied, broad and mouthfilling in the context of Sauvignon Blanc, with a long, white grapefruit finish. Drink through the end of 2008.",Pioneer Block 2 Swamp Block,91,26.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Saint Clair
14836,US,"This bubbly charms with cherry and raspberry flavors and a touch of limes and vanilla. It's nice and smooth in the mouth, with a creamy mousse. Showing real finesse and elegance, this sparkler will be delicious with raw tuna.",Blanc de Noirs,91,20.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Gloria Ferrer
14837,Australia,"Lush and creamy on the palate, this is wonderfully soft and enveloping, offering a hedonistic mouthful of black cherry fruit, yet not without ample complexity. The ripe cherry core is surrounded by flashes of vanilla, hints of peppery spice and cola, and finishes with a touch of licorice. Drink now–2012.",Killerman's Run,91,20.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Shiraz-Grenache,Kilikanoon
14838,Italy,"Browning slightly at the edge, the Chiarlo has already evolved beautifully. The smoky red fruit is combined with clove, anise and rose petals. Well balanced and with a medium finish, over the next five years, this will drink beautifully.",Reyna,91,35.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Michele Chiarlo
14839,US,"Many winemakers use Milbrandt fruit for their Syrahs, so it's no surprise that the brothers' own winery has a Syrah that stands at the top of the product line. There is precision and power here, with deep cherry and boysenberry fruit, tart acids that hint at lemon rind, a sharp peppery streak and a finish that somehow suggests chocolate and pineapple candy. Complex, muscular and delicious.",Legacy,91,25.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Syrah,Milbrandt
14840,US,"Just delicious, a blend of Syrah, Mourvedre and Grenache that shows how well Paso Robles can make these Rhône reds. The wine is soft and voluptuous, with complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, milk chocolate, licorice and cinnamon spice. Finishes long and rewardingly dry.",,91,18.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,Minassian-Young
14841,US,"This is one of the biggest, richest Chardonnays that Rodney Strong has ever produced, and no wonder, as longtime winemaker Rick Sayre was assisted by David Ramey as a consultant. The wine has Ramey-esque proportions, gigantic in fleshy tropical fruit, caramel, vanilla cream, butterscotch and meringue flavors. It's so softly decadent, it's almost better as a cocktail wine than with food.",Reserve,91,30.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Rodney Strong
14842,US,"This is pure Cabernet from one of Washington's oldest vineyards. Cold Creek is a hot site, and its grapes are scattered throughout many of the Ste. Michelle brands, often providing the core fruit. Here is the essence, a wine that opens a bit grudgingly, but has structure and concentration if you take the time to let it blossom. Dense cherry and cassis fruit is tightly wound with balancing acids. The use of new oak is restrained, but sufficient, and this is a wine that should age nicely for many years.",Cold Creek Vineyard,91,26.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau Ste. Michelle
14843,US,"So forward and appealing right now, it's hard to resist, but this could gain a little traction with a two or three years of age. It's polished in cherry jam and blackberry-pie filling, with earthy tones of coffee, figs, sage and cedar. The intricate tannins play nicely against the acidity, which gives it an upscale feeling.",,91,24.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Flora Springs
14844,Austria,"The epitome of aristocratic, full-bodied Riesling. This wine has all the rosehip and white flower aromas, followed by structured, fresh, crisp green pear and white currant fruits. There is a great purity of line here, directed by the acidity and the cutting crispness of the aftertaste. Screwcap.",Wagramterrassen,91,34.0,Wagram-Donauland,,,Riesling,Leth
14845,US,"This Pinot is pretty extracted, but the flavors are addictively good, offering a cornucopia of raspberries, cherries, blackberries, tangerines and cola, with complex nuances of sassafras, orange Pekoe tea, cola and dusty spices. It's a little soft, but silky and rich in tannins, a classic Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir.",Pisoni Vineyard,91,55.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Roar
14846,US,"From the pretty pale, amber color to the long, distinguished finish, this is a great rosé sparkler. To begin with, it's dry, a point in its favor, while the flavors are subtle and complex. They suggest pink grapefruits, tangerine zest, a squeeze of white peach, vanilla, and the smoke and dough of oak and lees. With its low alcohol and very low pH, it's a balanced wine of great structural integrity.",Brut Rosé,91,26.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Sparkling Blend,Roederer Estate
14847,Austria,"A wonderfully pure, fresh and natural wine, limpid with minerality, green fruits, concentrated pepper and spice. This is a powerful expression of Grüner Veltliner, a rich, but freshly green wine. Glass stopper.",Lindberg Reserve,91,34.0,Kremstal,,,Grüner Veltliner,Salomon-Undhof
14848,US,"This Cab-based Bordeaux blend has sizable amounts of Merlot and Cab Franc. It's quite a distinguished wine, classic in the modern Napa sense of softness and ripeness to the point of decadent drinkability. There's a sweet olive-tapenade edge to the blackberry, cassis and cherry flavors. The finish, believe it or not, suggests blueberry pie, fresh from the oven.",The Oracle,91,70.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Miner
14849,Austria,"Soft and finely perfumed, this is full-bodied Riesling, adding just a touch of sweetness to the pear and white currant fruit flavors. This is a great vintage of this wine, probably the best since 2002.",Langenloiser Steinmassel,91,30.0,Kamptal,,,Riesling,Bründlmayer
14850,Argentina,"Is there a better, more consistent Malbec on the market today than Punto Final? The 2005 is typically rich and dense, with saturated berry aromas and a strong but balanced oak element. The palate is a potpourri of berries, chocolate and vanilla, while the mouthfeel is juicy and stacked. Quite delicious; this is the type of wine that gives Argentine Malbec its good name.",Punto Final Reserva,91,18.0,Mendoza Province,Perdriel,,Malbec,Bodega Renacer
14851,Italy,"Who says southern Italian wines won't age gracefully? Here is an eight-year-old specimen that delivers generous expressions of dried currants, tar, leather, licorice and refined toasted notes without seeming tired or old. It has firm tannins and a long finish but probably won't last too much longer. Drink now.",Patriglione,91,61.0,Southern Italy,Puglia,,Negroamaro,Taurino
14852,US,"I like the elegance, but it seems like it was rushed to market. It will certainly benefit from cellaring, as it's young and rude in acids right now, and not showing well. But there's something here in the vast heart of  cherries and pomegranates and overall balance. Should improve by the end of 2007, and hold for another five years.",Keefer Ranch Vineyard,91,53.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
14853,US,"This is an expensive wine, by Lodi or any standards, but it's also a really good one. Blended with Petite Sirah, it has a soft texture and decadent mouthfeel, and the flavors are of creme de cassis, caramel cream, melted milk chocolate, tangerine zest and cinnamon-spiced gingerbread. It's certainly not an ager, so drink up.",Lust,91,49.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Zinfandel,Michael David
14854,US,"Michel Rolland consults on this exceptional Merlot. The blend is 77% Merlot, 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot. Though not quite as supremely dark, dense and concentrated as the immense '03, this silky wine is more elegant, with grace notes of licorice, citrus, coffee and plenty of tart strawberry and raspberry fruit.",,91,55.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Pedestal
14855,Australia,"Incredibly powerful, with bold lime sherbet aromas that are nearly overwhelming in their intensity. Flavors are strident and linear at this young stage, underscored by vibrant acidity and fantastic length. You can enjoy it now for its brute force, but will be better rewarded by cellaring it for 5–10 years.",The Eden,91,35.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,,Riesling,Poonawatta Estate
14856,US,"Similar to the winery's '05 Russian River bottling in the ripeness of the fruit and tannins, but somehow fresher, although it's still a big, full-bodied Pinot Noir. Maybe it's the acidity that makes the framboise and cherry flavors come alive. Deeper notes of Portobello mushrooms and balsamic suggest moderate aging possibilities. Drink now through 2009.",,91,39.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
14857,Argentina,"Purple as can be, with a loaded bouquet of black fruit and oak. This is your classic heavyweight, and while 2004 was not a great vintage in Mendoza, this wine still shows excellent depth, weight and balance. Firm on the finish, with big tannins and grab. Production was only 175 cases; drink now–2009. Imported by Southern Wine Group.",Firmado,91,90.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
14858,US,"Made with 82% Cabernet, this interesting wine is showing all kinds of possibilities. It's a good red now, sturdily dry and tannic, with red cherry, pomegranate, sweet tobacco and allspice flavors. But it's a little juvenile. I would decant it as long as possible, and it should enjoy a cellar life of up to 10 years.",Chairman's Club,91,85.0,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère,Chalk Hill
14859,Spain,"One of the best efforts we've tried from Jumilla, Luzon's luxury blend starts with coconut, mint, char and fudge, and below that is a treasure trove of deep black fruit.

An affordable shining star for a rising region.",Altos de Luzón,91,16.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Red Blend,Bodegas Luzón
14860,US,"Iron Horse joins the unoaked Chard bandwagon with this dry, complex wine. Their estate grapes are so good, the wine doesn't even need all that wood. It's elaborately tailored in pineapple, mango, ripe white peach and spicebox flavors. The vanilla and smoke, which have got to come from the grapes, add extra deliciousness.",UnOaked,91,25.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Iron Horse
14861,Spain,"This younger-vines mix of Garnacha, Carignan, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah is very attractive and loaded with graphite, schisty mineral and black cherry aromas. The palate comes in waves, with the first delivering plum and berry and the second offering chocolate, herbs and lavender. Quite pretty and very tannic. Hold until 2008, if possible.",Les Sentius,91,35.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Joan Simó
14862,US,"Despite its youth, this is a complete and satisfying wine. Woodward Canyon reds virtually always develop well in bottle, and so you can assume that this will continue to improve.

14863,US,"Long Shadows Pirouette is made by Agustin Huneeus and Philippe Melka; it's 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Merlot, 11% Syrah and 13% Petit Verdot. Aromatic and seductive, it sends waves of perfumed fruit, dusty cocoa, bright espresso and toasted grain from the glass, leading into a soft, smooth and seamless palate. This rich and luscious wine could easily pass for a much pricier Napa Valley blend.",,91,55.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Pirouette
14864,Australia,"This impeccably made wine boasts a rich, almost unctuous mouthfeel that beautifully complements its flavors of blackberries, dried spices, toast and vanilla. It's delicious now, but the flavors are so young and primary it's hard to imagine it not being even better in another year or two. Long on the finish, with echoes of oak and fruit lingering elegantly.",,91,22.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Tapestry
14865,Italy,"Dark in color and deep in concentration, this is a ripe Aglianico-Piedirosso (80-20) blend with tones of mature red cherry, beets, roasted peanut, espresso and roasted red pepper.

14866,US,"The blend is 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot, 24% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot. Another fine effort from this young winery. Here is classic styling from a great vineyard source, with beautiful definition, and gorgeous, refined and sculpted fruit framed in concise, molded, firm tannins. The tart red fruit is wrapped in crisp acids and finished with tight, hard, slightly bitter tannins. The penetration and elegance of this wine are what stand out; it's young and compact and suggests a long life ahead.",Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,91,27.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,:Nota Bene
14867,Australia,"An interesting wine, in that it doesn't fit the current rage for blockbuster Shiraz. As winemaker Charles Whish says, “It doesn't have to be huge and rich and jammy—it needs to have finesse and length.” This vintage does show a slightly lifted, vinyl-like note on the nose, but then settles down to offer elegant flavors of plum, spice and vanilla. Finishes long. Drink now–2015.",Balmoral,91,45.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Rosemount
14868,Austria,"This is a gently medium-sweet wine, but that hardly does justice to the beautiful balance between the acidity, sweetness, freshness and lightness. It just floats, only given a slight pull earthwards by the mineral aftertaste.",Riesling am Berg,91,,Niederösterreich,,,Riesling,R&A; Pfaffl

14870,US,"The wine, from a warm vintage, bursts with fruity charm, but this is a mountain Cab, and while acids are low, you'll find strong tannins.

14872,Italy,"A 70-30 blend of Negroamaro grape and hearty Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a highly successful rendition with succulent concentration, a pretty purplish hue and a nice balance between ripe fruit and tar-like aromas.

14876,US,"Rockpile, a mountainy region in Dry Creek Valley, has given in this warm vintage a big young Syrah. Dry and smooth, it bursts with enormously ripe cherry flavors, but also is very tannic. It's high in alcohol, a potential fault, but something in the acid-tannin structure keeps it balanced, and even elegant. Best now and for the next few years.",Rockpile Vineyard Haley's Reserve,91,50.0,California,Rockpile,Sonoma,Syrah,JC Cellars
14877,Spain,"Intense and deep, with plenty of licorice, leather and pepper encasing serious dark-berry aromas.

Good but with some excess oak to process.",,86,18.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Peña Roble
14882,US,"The oak stands out, giving this Pinot a vanilla, caramel and buttered cinnamon toast dominance over the underlying cherry jam fruit.

Under all that are notes of toasted almond and pistachio that are characteristic of the Nero d'Avola grape.",Mille e Una Notte,93,80.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Contessa Entellina,,Nero d'Avola,Donnafugata
14975,Germany,"Enticingly complex nose, multifaceted, with a medley of blossoms, honey, spice, white peaches and ample minerality showing through. Sweet, with delicious racy acidity and a lively taut texture. This is very focused, with generous flavors of elderberries, stone fruit, orange citrus, spice and slate. Long, persistent finish.",Haus Klosterberg Spätlese,93,23.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Markus Molitor
14976,Austria,"A smooth, cream–textured wine, just given an edge by a spice and yeast character. The wine offers layers of acidity, white fruits, crisp apples rounded out by its richness. For aging over 4–5 years, probably more.",Pfaffenberg Reserve,93,55.0,Kremstal,,,Riesling,Metternich-Salomon
14977,US,"A few years in the bottle are beginning to age this charming Chardonnay, although its brisk acidity and minerality remain. The pear, guava, nectarine and tangerine flavors are just starting to pick up a dried fruit character. Complex and savory, it's a very fine wine to drink now.",La Cruz Vineyard,93,36.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Keller Estate
14978,France,"With its firm, black fruits, this is a very chunky wine, mineral in character. It has tension, with tannins layered with intense flavors, very structured. It needs aging. One of a series of single-vineyard wines created by Jean-Luc Baldès.",Clos Triguedina Les Galets,93,30.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Jean-Luc Baldès
14979,France,"Made using an adaptation of a Cahors tradition of warming the must before fermentation to increase stability as well as color. Immensely powerful tannins, chocolate density, with a youthful bitter edge at this stage.",Clos Triguedina The New Black Wine,93,60.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Jean-Luc Baldès
14980,Austria,"An impressive, ageworthy Riesling. It shows great depth of flavor, its intense, biting acidity shooting through the green apple and plum fruits. Very nervy, minerally and taut. Designed for longterm aging.",Schiefer Reserve,93,,Kremstal,,,Riesling,Forstreiter
14981,US,"A beautiful Cabernet, dry, smoothly tannic and impressive for its volume of flavor. Shows a complex range of blackberries, black currants, minerals and oak, with a long, spicy finish. Elegant and powerful at the same time, it should develop in the bottle over the next decade.",Unfiltered,93,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Newton
14982,US,"A lovely Pinot Noir, dry and silky and rich, with complex flavors of raspberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, sandalwood and white pepper. Easy to drink now for its sleekness and elegance. Only 296 cases were produced but a single-vineyard wine worth seeking out.",Gunsalus Vineyard,93,36.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Talisman
14983,Germany,"Schloss Saarstein's auslese is remarkably consistent year to year, testament to the greatness of the site and the quality of the farming and winemaking. The 2008 features cool, slate-driven scents softened just slightly by hints of superripe apples and ripe apricot. This medium-bodied wine is clean and tightly focused, with the sweetness admirably balanced by crisp acids. Should age 15 years or more.",Serrig Schloss Saarsteiner Auslese 375 ml,93,56.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Schloss Saarstein
14984,US,"Bone dry, and brightened with zesty acidity, this fabulous SB defines the category. Accented with a touch of oak, it stars potent citrus and tropical fruit, green apple, white flower and mineral flavors, with a complexity that makes it easily worth the price. Gets better and better as it warms in the glass.",Helena Bench,93,38.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Matanzas Creek
14985,US,"Anyone who doesn't love this Pinot just doesn't understand California's approach. It's a fantastically delicious wine, completely satisfying in raspberry, cherry, persimmon, toast, spice and vanilla flavors, and balanced with bright, coastal acidity. Just beautiful, and it grows better as it warms in the glass. Probably not an ager, but wonderful now and through 2013.",Burnside Vineyard,93,70.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Patz & Hall
14986,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay, notable for its elegant structure. Perfect acidity and just a hint of tannins, much of it from oak barrels, provide the framework for the pineapple and kiwi fruit flavors, enriched with notes of cream and buttered toast.",Rancho Santa Rosa,93,40.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Foley
14987,US,"A brilliant Chardonnay showing how well this region can ripen fruit while retaining brisk acidity. Oak barrels add an exotic touch of clove to the underlying pineapple fruit flavors. Feels rich and creamy, and aging on the lees provides a complex touch of sourdough. Drink now.",T Anchor Ranch,93,45.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Foley
14988,Argentina,"One sniff tells you plenty: there's attractive spice, coffee and leather to go with rich molasses and broad black-fruit aromas. The palate maintains balance due to fine, fresh acidity, and the flavor profile brings mocha, coffee, berry, plum and toast. Delicious, deep, layered and refined. Will age for at least 5–6 years, but best from 2012–2014.",Catena Alta,93,50.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
14989,France,"With just shy of 1,000 bottles produced, this will be hard to find. Dried fruit flavors of raspberry and red plum dominate the nose and mouth, while notes of sweet mulled spice, clove-pricked orange rind, pepper, walnut skin and bittersweet cocoa glimmer throughout. Full and rich but lively, with medium acidity and a zippiness to the finish. Enjoyable now, but this will benefit from another 5–10 years in the cellar.",Legend Vintage,93,300.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Banyuls,,Red Blend,Gérard Bertrand
14990,US,"Run, don't walk, to find this amazingly priced Cabernet. It's so good and rich, it easily holds its own against Cabs costing five times as much. Dry and smooth in tannins, it offers a burst of blackberry, black cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors, with a wonderful coating of oak. Drink now–2013.",Signature Series,93,20.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kirkland Signature
14991,South Africa,"A beautifully balanced and nuanced wine. The aromas are heady and thick but still vibrant, displaying juicy notes of black cherry, black raspberry sauce and semidried fig laced with accents of bittersweet chocolate, tobacco and white pepper. The texture is like crushed satin, with well-integrated tannins and a creamy mouthfeel. Touches of licorice root and smoky cedar spice augment the dark fruit on the lengthy finish. Drink now–2014.",Series C,93,50.0,Paarl,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Vilafonté
14992,Germany,"This succulent, almost tender, wine starts off with lovely aromas of honey and bergamot, adding hints of apricot and vanilla in the mouth. It's a soft, lush style, rather sweet, with a long, mouthwatering finish. It may not be as long-lived as some 2007s, but it should remain delectable for another 10 years or so.",Rosalack Auslese 375 ml,93,,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Schloss Johannisberger
14993,Germany,"Realistically priced for genuine German eiswein, this is also rather alcoholic for most, weighing in at 10% abv. So it may not be as sweet as expected, but it still shows razor-like focus, with the residual sweetness balanced by bright pink grapefruit and pineapple notes.",Bernkasteler Johannisbrünnchen Eiswein 375 ml,93,95.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler
14994,US,"Another terrific wine from this vineyard, following the superb '07. May be a bit less flamboyant, but with better structure, and equally ageable. Dry and full bodied and fairly tannic, it shows powerful cherry and raspberry fruit, smoked meat, sautéed wild mushroom and sandalwood flavors, liberally spiced. Drinkable now, and should develop through 2014, at least.",Pastorale Vineyard,93,100.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Freestone
14995,US,"Dark and tannic, reflecting the vineyard's location in the cooler, foggier northwest, this Pinot Noir is dramatic in depth of flavor. With its core of blackberries, cherries, blueberries, cola and rhubarb, it's tight and rigid now, suggesting 5–6 years in the cellar.",Gowan Creek Vineyard,93,75.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Goldeneye
14996,US,"This small, family-owned, biodynamically farmed vineyard and winery is quickly becoming a southern Oregon cult producer. Certainly one of the finest Viogniers produced anywhere in the Northwest, this extraordinarily aromatic wine showers the palate with luscious and tangy lemon, pineapple, Satsuma orange and pear fruit flavors. Then the spices pile on, lending an exotic twist to a lengthy midpalate, and leading into a lightly toasty finish.",,93,30.0,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Southern Oregon,Viognier,Cowhorn
14997,France,"Aged in large wood barrels, this is a big, powerful wine with medicinal, herbal aromas and a polished feel. The dark plums and bitter coffee give a rich aftertaste. Age for 5–6 years.",L'Esprit de Caminade,93,,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Château la Caminade
14998,France,"Toasty aromas are followed by intense black plum fruits twisted with tannins and polished with wood. It's an impressive, powerful wine, with a complex structure. Firm at this stage, it need 4¬–5 years at least to age.",La Commandery,93,22.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Château la Caminade
14999,Germany,"Shows lovely balance between intense sweetness and crisp acidity, so that the wine's honeyed citrus notes really sing. Hints of marmalade, clove and a perfumed, slightly minty note all add complexity. Delicious now, and probably for a good many years to come.",Herrenberg Eiswein 375 ml,93,50.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Maximin Grünhäuser
15000,Australia,"This is a big, loud Shiraz, bursting with blackberry fruit and scents of cola, vanilla and toast. The flavors favor blackberries but also blend in hints of fruitcake and spice that easily conceal its 14.9% alcohol. Long and lush on the finish, this is delicious now but should also hold at least five years.",The Prophet,91,30.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Chapel Hill
15001,France,"With its highly mineral aroma, this is almost like smelling chalk. It's an austere wine, with high acidity, crystal clear on the palate, full of grapefruit flavors and flint texture. Age this wine at least 4 years.",Blanc de Blancs,91,50.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Delamotte
15002,US,"This has a buttery, creamy softness that belies the usual hardness of Washington Cab. Excellent winemaking shows off not just the plum and cherry fruit, set against a thick wash of chocolaty oak, but also the firm acid and hints of citrus and earth that elevate the wine beyond the ordinary.",Destiny Ridge Vineyard,91,30.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alexandria Nicole
15003,US,"This wonderfully rich wine combines the best of all three varieties to produce a complex white. It shows rich green apple, pineapple jam, superripe apricot, honeysuckle and smoky oak flavors, and while it's tremendously honeyed on the finish, it is basically dry. Crisp acidity, probably from the Carneros Chardonnay, provides needed balance.",Blend 23 Sauvignon Blanc - Viognier - Chardonnay,91,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,White Blend,B Cellars
15004,US,"Packs plenty of powerful complexity into a dry wine that's a pretty good price. Made in full-Burgundian style, with barrel fermentation and lees aging, it's a rich, creamy wine packed with spicy tropical fruit and honeysuckle flavors. Try as an interesting alternative to an upscale Chardonnay.",,91,20.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Roussanne,Truchard
15005,US,"This is a Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, and quite a good one. It has a classic mountain profile of intense cassis, cherry and cedar flavors, with firm, astringent tannins. Decanting will help it soften, but you're better off cellaring this polished wine for a few years.",Special Blend,91,40.0,California,Napa,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Amicus by X Winery
15006,Austria,"The rare Roter Veltliner is almost entirely confined to the slopes of the Wagram. Here it gives a style that is fragrant, with aromas of hedgerow flowers and delicate roses. Here these characters are combined with a full, tropical fruit character, touches of mango along with intense spice and acidity. Screwcap.",Scheiben,91,30.0,Wagram-Donauland,,,Roter Veltliner,Leth
15007,US,"Keller enters the big leagues with this marvelously layered Pinot Noir. For starters, it's delicious. Dry and crisp, the flavors are of ripe cherries, raspberries, tangerines, pomegranates and cola, with smoky, spicy complexities from new French oak. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, leading to a long, fruity finish. Best now and through 2010.",La Cruz Vineyard,91,40.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller Estate
15008,US,"The estate bottling is 100% Sémillon and tastes a bit riper and more peachy than the Columbia Valley bottling, though perhaps less nuanced. Barrel fermented in both new and second year French oak, it adds honeysuckle, sweet apple and a hint of mint to the sweet fruit.",Seven Hills Vineyard Estate,91,20.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sémillon,L'Ecole No. 41
15009,Austria,"This comes from a terraced vineyard that Josef Umathum revived in 2001. Here is an already impressive testament to the quality of the vineyard. With its aromas of cedar and pine cones, the palate is densely packed with black fruits, dark tannins, red berries and a chocolate finish.",Joiser Kirschgarten,91,60.0,Burgenland,,,Blaufränkisch,Umathum
15010,Australia,"Not the biggest, blackest or most extracted Shiraz, this is a more elegant, complex example, boasting hints of violets and espresso on the nose, alongside smoky, meaty notes and plenty of berry fruit. It's fresh and not overly weighty, managing to seem light in weight without being light on flavor.",Eliza,91,39.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Shottesbrooke
15011,US,"Summers has been quietly perfecting Cabernet under the radar. The '04 continues a string of successful vintages. It's riper and more accessible than previous years, and rewards for expressive black currant flavors enhanced with lots of fine, smoky new oak. The tannins are so gentle, you can drink this wine now, but it should hold for a good six years.",,91,46.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Summers
15012,Italy,"Not your everyday Docetto, the nose is far more aromatic than the typical version, while the fruit takes a supporting role to the tarry earthiness of the more traditional main flavors, which follows through to a medium finish. Lovely, complex and delicious.",Rossana,90,21.0,Piedmont,Dolcetto d'Alba,,Dolcetto,Ceretto
15013,France,"An enticing, sophisticated wine. While it is fresh, with great floral aromas and flavors, it also shows hints of maturity, with toast just beginning to float over the yeast and grapefruit flavors. The aftertaste is very dry, crisp.",Tsarine Cuvée Premium Brut,90,46.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Chanoine
15014,US,"Not quite as opulent as the '04, but rich and softly appealing in blackberry, cherry, raspberry, mocha, lavender and peppery spice flavors. Drink now and through 2008 for its youthful fruitiness.",Rancho Santa Rosa,90,30.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Syrah,Foley
15015,Austria,"Pears and honey go together in this rich wine. Perhaps the power is too much, but it certainly impresses with its mineral structure, green spices and complex mix of exotic fruits and reined-in intensity. Screwcap.",Scheiben,90,40.0,Wagram-Donauland,,,Grüner Veltliner,Leth
15016,US,"Rewards for its rich Champagne personality and California expression of fruity flavor. Although the texture could be a bit smoother, the wine has a fine mousse, with complex, subtle flavors of strawberries, limes, vanilla, yeasty dough and wood smoke.",Reserve Brut,90,26.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sparkling Blend,Mumm Napa
15017,Australia,"Although not indicated on the label, this is 100% Mourvèdre, bone dry and barrel fermented. As a result, it's not your typical fresh and fruity rosé, showing instead dark, complex flavors of cola, chocolate tree bark and earth. Hints of strawberry lighten it somewhat, but this is almost more red than rosé. Drink now–2008.",Saignée,90,20.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Rosé,Torbreck
15018,US,"What's so nice about this Cab is its balance and delicacy, without the heaviness that can mar a more alcoholic wine. It shows polished flavors of cherries, blackberries, cola and cedar, with a long, fine finish of cassis liqueur. Really an elegant sipper, this wine is best now and for a couple years.",,90,55.0,California,Yountville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rocca
15019,US,"What a great Zinfandel this is. It's lusty and hearty, just the way you want a Zin to wash down barbecue, but it also has balance and even elegance, despite the high alcohol. The ripe blackberry and cherry flavors are jammy, complexed with spicy tobacco and chocolate, and a pure finish of cassis.",Estate,90,20.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Minassian-Young
15020,New Zealand,"A blend of Dijon clones 667 and 777, this wine offers intense aromas of cherries, root beer, cola and chocolate. The texture is silky-smooth, while the flavors take on an intriguing herbal edge that adds welcome dimension to the ripe fruit and ample oak. Finishes complex, herbal and lingering; drink now–2012.",Pioneer Block 4 Sawcut,90,29.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Saint Clair
15021,Austria,"This is a steely, crisp, mineral wine, with lemon and orange zest flavors, piercingly fresh acidity and a touch of cinnamon. Glass stopper.",Pfaffenberg,90,26.0,Kremstal,,,Riesling,Salomon-Undhof
15022,US,"This is really solidly made and appealing wine, which nicely combines lush, chocolaty barrel flavors with penetrating Cabernet fruit. Cassis, cherry and sweet plum create a substantial fruit center, and it's swathed in a roasted coffee and mocha wrapping. Try it with a grilled steak, or better yet, a rich molé sauce.",Legacy,90,25.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Cabernet Sauvignon,Milbrandt
15023,Austria,"Made from the Sämling grape (also known as the Scheurebe), this is a wonderfully intense wine, balancing sweetness with crisp white pear acidity. It layers botrytis dryness with sweet hedgerow honey and a pure fruit character.",Beerenauslese,90,30.0,Burgenland,,,Scheurebe,Gesellmann
15024,US,"Here's one for the cellar. You could drink it now, with a little decanting, but such is the structural youth that you'd miss this Bordeaux blend at its best. Rich and savory in spicy black and red currant, cherry and cedar flavors, the wine shows a firm tannic structure, with a crisp bite of acidity. Hold until late 2008; should evolve over the next six to eight years.",,90,48.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hagen Heights
15025,France,"Wood maturation gives this wine roundness, despite its dryness. At the moment, it is too young, very vigorous, and touched by caramel. The feeling is of a weighty, structured wine, even though the aftertaste is fresh.",L'Avizoise Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs Extra Brut,90,90.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Agrapart & Fils
15026,New Zealand,"Slightly grassy, gooseberry notes bring a hint of herbaceousness to this medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc, but the core is based around lively melon and grapefruit flavors. Plump in the mouth, yet it finishes crisp and clean; more vibrant than Brancott's Reserve bottling, making it go down that much easier. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",B,90,23.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Brancott
15027,Austria,"Power and rich, spicy creaminess are the hallmarks of this full-bodied wine. Tropical fruit flavors of mango and lychee are spiced up with nutmeg. There is a fresh tingle on the palate, intriguing and leaving a positive question over its ageworthiness— 2–4 years.",Dechant Alte Reben,90,39.0,Kamptal,,,Grüner Veltliner,Jurtschitsch
15028,US,"A lovely Merlot, rich and fine, with lots of blackberry and cherry fruit, but also with more complex, earthier notes of olive tapenade, balsamic vinegar and sautéed wild mushrooms. The wine should hold for some years, but is really at its best now.",,90,36.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Keenan
15029,Italy,"Pio Cesare's Fides is several steps up from its basic Barbera. It shows a pretty, complex nose of black cherry, fennel and bacon, while on the palate, there is plenty of rich fruit, layered by the aromatics. Good levels of concentration and a long solid finish.",Fides,90,41.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Pio Cesare
15030,US,"A supple, supremely elegant wine, displaying its diverse flavors across a fine mesh. Very pretty aromatics carry a pleasing dustiness, accented with floral, sweetly spicy high notes. The tart fruit mixes citrus, tangerine, pineapple, green apple and pear, and finishes with nicely balanced toast and butterscotch.",,91,32.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Chardonnay,Abeja
15031,US,"Big, juicy Pinot, dry and fruity, with layers of flavor that change with every sip. Black cherries, cola, rhubarbs, pomegranates, coffee, sweet tobacco, spice and oak all mingle in a myriad of sensations, finishing long and intense. Good now, but tannicly closed enough to warrant cellaring beyond 2007.",Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard,91,40.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon
15032,Spain,"You want color and heft? You get that here, and more. Dark, grapy aromas are lush more than rough and tight, while the palate is full of sassy black cherry fruit and a fair share of richness. No doubt this jam-packed blend of Garnacha, Merlot and Carignan is solid and rewarding. 250 cases produced.",Ecològic,91,39.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Genium Celler
15033,US,"Midnight black and drily astringent, this is not a wine to pop open tonight. But it's extraordinarily ripe and deep in black currants, with all kinds of earthy cocoa, balsamic, basil, Portobello, coffee and spice flavors. It will blossom and knit together with some time in the bottle. Best 2008–2011, at least.",Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard,91,40.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Dutton-Goldfield
15034,US,"Tannins and acids currently dominate, giving this dry, young wine a bit of a lockdown quality. The winemaker, Michael Trujillo, aims at a more structured style, and he has achieved it here. There's a deep heart of cherries and blackberries, with sweeter oaky notes. This is a wine to lay down for six years or longer.",Semper V Meritage,91,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Sequoia Grove
15035,US,"Not quite in the same league as the winery's '03 Morisoli Cab, but at less than half the price, a very good Cabernet. Polished and dry, it's ripe in the modern style, and well-structured in acids and tannins. With true varietal flavors of blackberry jam and cherries, sweetened with smoky cedar, it's beautiful now.",,91,32.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sequoia Grove
15036,US,"Pale in color and sharp in youthful acids, this Pinot needs time to show its stuff. It tastes good now, with rich cola, cherry, herb tea and cinnamon spice flavors, but the parts desperately need time to knit together. Best beyond 2007, for five years or so.",Rosella's Vineyard,91,45.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Siduri
15037,US,"Very dry and a little earthy, with a dusty hay or dried straw quality to the tangerine, sweet lime, lychee, peaches and cream flavors. An interesting, crisp Chard with plenty of nuanced complexity.",,91,30.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Petroni
15038,Italy,"A small portion of Merlot (15%) is blended into this Aglianico-based wine to achieve plush concentration and inviting aromas of forest berry, cookie dough, peppermint, Porcini mushroom, spice and loads of licorice. It's a very solid and tannic wine that would pair well with hearty meat or game dishes: Oak-aged for 12 months.",Briccone,91,40.0,Southern Italy,Sannio,,Aglianico,Mustilli
15039,Argentina,"Attractive and well put together from start to finish. This Cab (with 15% Malbec) is jammed with cassis, raspberry and other juicy berry flavors, while the lushness of the wine rolls over your palate with ease.

15040,Spain,"From a brutally hot vintage, this shows plenty of mineral, schist and cola aromas along with impeccably smooth fruit. It's a little racy and sheer in the mouth, but food will balance that without a problem. And along the way you should enjoy the licorice, cherry, kirsch and other crafty nuances that this fine blend of Cabernet, Garnacha and Carignan has to offer. Drink now through 2009.",,91,42.0,Catalonia,Montsant,,Red Blend,Mas de l'Abundància
15041,Spain,"Mildly sweet and candied, with accents of rose petal, red licorice and high-quality raisin. As always, it's an intense wine with red raspberry, cherry and plum flavors in front of finishing vanilla and butter. It's a bit grabby and tannic, but it seems to have harnessed correct ripeness in what was a difficult, hot year.",Clos de L'Obac,90,75.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Costers del Siurana
15042,Spain,"Waxy melon and apple aromas are intricate and welcoming, while the melon and citrus flavors are just as they should be.

15047,Argentina,"Nothing is hidden in this bruising, forward Cab. The nose is oaky as can be, but also endowed with intense black fruit.

15048,Austria,"The 8000 in the wine's name refers to the number of vines per hectare (the acre equivalent would be around 3,200); the very dense planting is to stress the vines and cut yields from individual plants.

15049,Italy,"There's a nice use of wood here with creamy concentration and toasted notes that are made obvious but do not overwhelm the fruit.

15050,Spain,"After a couple of rough years, all Fluminus needed was the good 2004 vintage. And the result is splendid. This blend of Cab, Garnacha and Carignan is pure as can be, with polished leather and fine tobacco aromas entering the fray. The whole is complete and big-boned, but in the end it's more tight and compact than plush. Give it two years to show its best side.",Flvminis,90,28.0,Catalonia,Montsant,,Red Blend,Mas de l'Abundància
15051,Australia,"Winemaker Peter Howland is making a name for himself by sourcing grapes from all over Australia. From his home base in the Hunter Valley, this Chardonnay deftly balances oaky notes of allspice and brown sugar with elements of Asian pear, melon and citrus. It's medium- to full-bodied, but held in check by zesty acidity. Long and nuanced on the finish. Drink now–2010, maybe longer.",Maxwell Vineyard,90,25.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,,Chardonnay,Peter Howland
15052,Argentina,"This is a delicious and somewhat rare style of Malbec: it has none of the usual oak. What you wind up with is fruity, clean and pure. The body is maybe a touch leaner without the oak; the flavor profile is brighter and more linear.",Opalo,90,18.0,Mendoza Province,Vista Flores,,Malbec,Mauricio Lorca
15053,Argentina,"Regal and ready, and showing equal amounts of early maturity along with youthful fruit and menthol aromas. The palate is saturated with raspberry and black cherry, while the lengthy finish offers coffee and chocolate. Drive and power are not in short supply, so take this one with fatty foods like ribs or steak.",Reserve,90,22.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Proemio
15054,US,"Dry, tannic and well-structured, this wine erupts with white pepper aromas and flavors. Then the fruit kicks in, all blackberry jam, leather, espresso, bitter chocolate and toasted cedar wood. It's different from the usual Lodi Zin, taking it to a higher plane of elegance and sophistication.",Cellar Select,90,16.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Zinfandel,Weinstock Cellars
15055,US,"This is a thoroughly delicious wine, pure-blooded Syrah from three vineyards. It puts bright, clean raspberry fruit right up front, then layers in a hint of bramble and earth against a foundation of firm, fine-grained tannins. It's authoritative, substantial, straightforward and absolutely tongue-riveting, a brilliant combination of finesse, tension and balance.",,90,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Waters
15056,France,"A Brotte-owned estate, Domaine Grosset shows that when the family puts their heart into doing the best they can, their efforts are rewarded. It's rich and spicy, with cola and plum aromas and flavors that are dense and almost fruitcake-like, finishing with hints of coffee and plum. Drink now-2015.",Domaine Grosset Cairanne,90,20.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône Villages,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Brotte
15057,Italy,"Despite its seven years of age (two of which were spent in oak), this is a seemingly youthful wine with bright and lively fruity tones of berries, cherry soda or candy, red apple backed by a supporting cast of vanilla, cedar and roasted nuts. It offers chewy, firm tannins and good length on the finish.",T,90,32.0,Southern Italy,Taurasi,,Aglianico,Di Meo
15058,US,"These grapes come from a variety of vineyards scattered widely across the state, but they add up to a 98% pure Cabernet Sauvignon, intense, dark, plummy, rich and full-bodied. It's got all the grape's key component flavors on display: olive, light herb, and juicy purple fruits. The oak is still coming into focus, with strong notes of vanilla and clove. Give it a few hours breathing time.",,90,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Barnard Griffin
15059,Spain,"Rustic fruit aromas led by the native Samso grape cause a stir, and the wine, which also has Garnacha, Cabernet and Merlot, carries forth in the mouth, where lush blackberry and plum flavors are supported by healthy, spicy, minty oak. With tight tannins and comfortable acidity, it will drink better in a few years. Imported by Bernard Magrez.",Herència del Padrí,90,75.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Bernard Magrez
15060,Australia,"So light in color, it's almost clear. Talc-powder aromas waft from the nose; on the palate, delicate yellow fruit is accented by floral notes. It's very unusual to find Margaret River wines at this price, so grab it up. Imported by Aussie Imports.",Vat 351,87,9.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Chardonnay,Abbey Vale
15061,Austria,"Bears a passing resemblance to Grüner Veltliner in its slightly leafy, peppery notes, but also shows apple and citrus flavors that are distinctively Riesling.

15062,Germany,"“Rotschiefer” means “red slate,” a reference to the soils underlying the vineyard parcel from which this wine is made. The wine itself is thick and rich, with pure scents of fresh-picked apples, and flavors of applesauce and minerals. Lacks the bit of zip that would put it over the top, ratings-wise, but still a very attractive wine for casual sipping. Imported by Magellan Wine Imports.",Rotschiefer Trocken,87,20.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Immich-Batterieberg

15064,Australia,"Blackberries and blueberries star on the palate; the nose, on the other hand, is all about black pepper. A slimmer-sized Shiraz rather than a huge, jammy one. Imported by R. H. Phillips.",Offspring,87,15.0,Western Australia,Western Australia,,Shiraz,Goundrey
15065,Germany,"Nicely done for an entry-level wine, with lovely fresh notes of green apple, spring flowers and lime on the nose, followed by apple, pear and pineapple flavors.

15068,Germany,"Part of a growing trend among German wines, the front label omits the vineyard name, but this is from the Westhofener Kirchspiel.

Imported by Chapin Cellars.",Kabinett,87,33.0,Rheinhessen,,,Riesling,Keller
15069,Austria,"Oakier than Tscheppe's regular bottling but ultimately not any more pleasurable. Toasty, mealy scents mask peach and melon flavors; the mouthfeel is thick and rich.

15071,Australia,"Made by Charles Cimicky, who apparently also had to join the “animals on labels” contest. Fanatics of the super-jammy, over-the-top style need look no further: Here is a package of vanilla and tea, dressing up vibrant blackberry-raspberry fruit. Still, it accomplishes its goal with class; you're not going to mistake this for an under-$10 wine. 5,000 cases produced. Imported by Epicurean Wines.",,87,14.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Shiraz,Piping Shrike

15073,Austria,"The Czerny family, who have 27 acres of vines on the terraces of the Wagram, make long-lived, bone-dry wines, produced from an organic vineyard. This wine has years to go.

15077,Australia,"This isn't a wine to age or mull over, but I like it very much. It has aromas of white stone fruit and fresh grass, and tastes like yellow peach, mango and other tropical fruit. It's upbeat, summery and pleasing. Imported by Oenophilia Imports.",,87,12.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,,Chenin Blanc,Amberley

15080,France,"A full-bodied wine, with aromas of apples and pears. It's dry, lively and fresh, with great crisp fruit, flavors of grapefruits, and long-lasting acidity. It needs two years to develop.",Réserve,87,16.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Pierre Sparr
15081,Australia,"Oak lends nutty, caroby aromas and big, woodsy tannins to this well-priced red; fleshy red plum and berry fruit makes up the balance. Has pretty good length on the finish, too.

15083,Australia,"This wine gets full credit for its smooth, eraser-like tannins—the feel is just lovely, as are eucalyptus and black pepper aromas.

15090,Australia,"A spare, austere, lemony sort of Sauvignon.It is almost unforgiving at first, but after a few sips, you get used to the style and begin to appreciate the minerally, chalky feel.

15138,Greece,"The bouquet is filled with the aromas of honey and overripe oranges and pears. The wine is very orangey on the palate, without a lot of nuance, but it finishes long, buoyed by mouthwatering acidity.",,86,9.0,Samos,,,Muscat,Kourtaki
15139,Greece,"A little bit of this and a little bit of that—this wine has it all, from peaches, to grapefruit to nuts. Lightweight, with a long, harmonious finish.",Domaine Matsa,86,20.0,Attica,,,Savatiano,Boutari
15140,Greece,"This is a brawny, ripe wine, with fruit flavors that veer toward prune and molasses while folding in dark earthy notes. Big and bulky, with full tannins that need 3–5 years to resolve.",,86,80.0,Halkidiki,,,Syrah,Porto Carras
15141,Australia,"Stands out for its olivey, peppery nose, followed by plump, grapy flavors and a dash of meaty complexity. Fire up the barbie and break out the lamb chops.",,86,10.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Petit Verdot,Salena Estate

15144,Greece,"Starts off straightforward enough, with scents of green apple, pear and citrus. Flavors are harder to describe, echoing the aromas but adding a note of vegetable oil.

15147,Greece,"Earth and tobacco, backed by modest cassis flavors that are already starting to thin out. Dry tannins mark the finish. The '99 (non-Reserve) is a better bet.",Metoxi Reserve,85,44.0,Mount Athos,,,Cabernet Blend,Tsantali
15148,Greece,"With its firm acids and modest tannins, tart cherries and worn leather, this is a natural burger wine—something assertive enough to pair with strong, simple flavors without being overwhelmed, yet not so complex as to demand finer fare.",St. George,85,13.0,Corinth,,,Agiorgitiko,Palivou
15149,Greece,"Not only is this 100% Assyrtiko, it's fermented and aged entirely in stainless steel, which completely preserves its biting acidity. It has some waxy, citrusy aromas and flavors, but they are secondary to the wine's dominating acids, which leave the mouth clean and tingling after each taste.",,85,15.0,Santorini,,,Assyrtico,Boutari
15150,US,"Almost indistinguishable from Beringer's Chabot bottling, perhaps a bit more aromatic and softer in tannins. Flavors range from cassis and black cherry through dark chocolate and dill. Drinkable now with rich foods, but will gain in sweetness and complexity with a few years of cellaring.",St. Helena Home Vineyard,92,80.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
15151,US,"A real find. French in style, dry, rich and elegant. Hints of cherry and cassis are wrapped in thick, fine tannins, and the mouthfeel is sensual and velvety.

15152,Italy,"A big, rich, Port-like Brunello that found controversy with our panel. While some admired it for its ripeness, others felt it a bit raisiny. Regardless, all agreed that it possesses intense concentration, a creamy mouthfeel and a long, softly tannic finish.",,92,65.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Fuligni
15153,US,"An extraordinary wine. From the cooler west side of the appellation, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Syrah offers a little something from each variety. The overall effect is a concerto, vibrant and complex. Huge oak, but the expressive fruit wears it well. Beautiful tannins coat the palate like a mink coat.",L'Adventure Estate Cuvée,92,75.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Red Blend,Stephan Ridge
15154,Portugal,"This lushly fruity Port folds in enough intriguing floral aromas to be more than a simple fruit bomb. Briary notes add another element to the creamy boysenberry flavors that are incredibly rich but not cloying or syrupy. Likely to mature early but hold well, thanks to masses of supple tannins. Great quality for the price.",Vintage Porto,92,45.0,Douro,,,Port,Quinta do Vale Meão
15155,US,"Pours inky black, and smells young and backward. Lots of airing reveals blackberry jam, with hints of dark chocolate, vanilla and toast. Drinks soft, velvety, luscious and complex. Good berry fruit is supported by firm, dry tannins. Lovely now, and best consumed in the next year or so to capture its vibrant youth.",,92,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Phoenix
15156,Italy,"This wine really grows on you. It starts off with slightly acrid, coarse elements of briar patch and weeds, but it explodes on the palate, turning rich, chocolaty and refined. Deep layers of softly tannic, plum-flavored fruit caress the mouth, leaving a lasting aftertaste.",Altero,92,57.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Poggio Antico
15157,Italy,"Satisfying and delicious at every point. The bouquet is lovely; it delivers dense plum fruit, chili-like spice and mounds of wet earth. The palate is pure blackberry and dark plum, and it finishes smooth as silk, with just enough coarseness to add texture and grit. Firm but not hard. A definite winner from Abruzzo. Drink by the end of 2004.",Ursonia,91,39.0,Central Italy,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,,Montepulciano,Il Feuduccio Di S. Maria D'Orni
15158,US,"When this wine was first produced it was a blend of three Bordeaux varietals, but longtime winemaker Ken Deis has since expanded his palate. This year's version is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with some Cabernet Franc and Malbec. A young, dense wine with significant tannins, it is marked by an overlay of well-charred oak, but the core of cassis suggests ageability.",Trilogy,91,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Meritage,Flora Springs
15159,US,"Pretty tannic, a wine that makes the tongue stick to the palate, although it will soften and sweeten up with big, rich roasts. Underlying flavors are of blackberries, currants and tobacco, and the finish is very dry. Seems to have the density and concentration to cellar for the long haul.",Quarry Vineyard,91,80.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
15160,Italy,"Rich, smoky, pure and encouraging from the first take all the way to the back end. There's lots of zest and spunk to this racy yet round Chianti. The palate is full of blackberry and the feel is supple. It's totally ripe and tannic, with notes of vanilla, chocolate and espresso forming the base. Oaky but integrated; modern but traditional enough.",,91,20.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Carpineto

15162,US,"Pours dark, and opens with aromas of cassis and smoky oak and vanilla, suggesting a very young wine. Enters with smooth, gorgeous tannins and a rich, velvety mouthfeel that carries along flavors of blackberry nectar that explode mid-palate. This crescendo tapers off in the long finish, where the young, ripe tannins show up. Age through 2010.",,91,46.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sawyer Cellars
15163,US,"There must have been severe vineyard selection for this wine, for it rises above the vintage to achieve real intensity and concentration.

15165,Portugal,"Effectively a 25-year-old tawny, this wine starts off slowly, with restrained aromas of nuts and dried fruit. Then it caresses the palate with silky, lush, honeyed flavors of walnuts, oranges, cinnamon and clove, building to a crescendo on the long, anise-tinged finish.",Colheita Bottled 2002,91,75.0,Port,,,Port,Barros
15166,US,"An extremely tannic and tough wine that numbs the palate despite polished plum, blackberry and dry chocolate flavors. Oak adds vanilla, smoke and a richly creamy texture. Will it age? The compact berry-cherry flavors suggest yes. Try again in 10 years.",Chabot Vineyard,91,80.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
15167,Italy,"The nose of this Sangiovese-Merlot is muscular and broad, with a hint of earth and mushroom sneaking in between the folds of deep red fruit. More robust fruit fills out the palate, while it finishes long and chocolaty, with notes of coffee. Quite sturdy and eminently satisfying.",RosSole,91,28.0,Tuscany,Chianti,,Sangiovese,Borgo Salcetino
15168,Portugal,"Luis Pato's Bairradas used to be the standouts of the D.O. In a sense they still are, although he has chosen to label them with the regional denomination of Beiras in protest over restrictive practices. In this example, Pato has harnessed the rough tannins and brash acidity of Baga into a rich creamy wine filled with blackberries and anise. It's still tannic and crisp, but it just needs another 10 years in the cellar to become fully appreciable.",Quinta do Moinho Baga,91,60.0,Beiras,,,Baga,Luis Pato
15169,Italy,"Deep and ripe; once inside, you'll find a jumpy blend of ripe black stone fruits laid over a leathery texture. On the finish, coffee and toast offer darkness and coarseness. Firm tannins suggest a few years more aging.",,91,70.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese,Poderi Brizio
15170,Italy,"Round and ripe, with woody hints, a note of bramble patch and plenty of saturated red fruit.

15171,US,"Pretty tannic, and extremely well-oaked. Char, vanilla and smoke dominate the opening aroma, only gradually revealing underlying cassis flavors. In the mouth, the wine is tannic and young, but the solid core of cherry-berry suggests aging until 2008.",State Lane,91,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
15172,US,"At first this is very woody, bordering on sappy. But with time the wood softens, leaving ripe and bright cassis, plum and black cherry. The finish is toasty and creamy. And while it feels full and hearty, the wine isn't hard or tannic. An interesting blend of Cabernet, Sangiovese and Petite Sirah.",,91,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,Bacio Divino
15173,US,"A very fine Cabernet, the kind you like to think you'd instantly identify in a blind tasting as superior Napa. It has ripe flavors of cassis and blackcurrants, and fabulously rich, dry, complicated tannins that glide across the palate with velvety smoothness.

15174,US,"This Merlot/Cabernet blend (hence, Mernet) serves up fairly exuberant aromas.

Long at the end.",Mernet,91,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,Keenan
15175,US,"From vineyards quite high up in the eastern mountains, this wine is from stressed, low-yielding grapes. The blackberry and cassis flavors are concentrated and dense, and the tannins are tough and firm. Oak plays a supporting role. Rich foods, such as lamb or gongonzola cheese, will soften and sweeten it, but you're best off cellaring for a few years.",Alden Vineyards,91,30.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
15176,Italy,"Spicy and bold at first, and then it evolves to display earth, trail dust and flower-petal aromas. Juicy in the mouth due to bright acids that prop up healthy fruit. The tannins are mammoth, but with a fine steak or breast of duck, they'll sing. Quite a nice surprise from a property in the midst of a renaissance.",Coltassala Riserva,91,46.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Volpaia
15177,US,"Laurel Glen's second wine, and no slouch. This vintage brings a richly textured, deeply flavored Cab as good as many costing far more.

15178,Australia,"Big and black, with complex aromas and flavors of earth, tobacco, coffee and dark plums that hit you hard and pump out the bass notes all the way through the finish.

15179,US,"Quite as tannic as Beringer's other limited-release single-vineyard Cabs, although a streak of buttery softness makes it drinkable now.

Try after 2006.",Tre Colline,91,80.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer

15184,Spain,"Concentrated, willing aromas of black cherry and sweet plum are nice and friendly, while the palate is lively, juicy and a little tart for Garnacha, with an emphasis on red raspberry. The wine dries out a bit on the finish, leaving vanilla and spice. Good enough for a basic Aragonese red.",Corona d'Aragón,85,13.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Garnacha,Grandes Vinos y Viñedos
15185,US,"Lots of oak on this wine, which shows rich vanilla custard, buttered toast and caramel flavors. However, the underlying fruit isn't able to support it. There's some pineapple and nectarine, but the wine ultimately collapses under all the wood.",,85,30.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Guarachi Family
15186,Argentina,"Not sure why a Mendoza Malbec is named Havana Rose, but that's not really important when you taste this ripe, candied wine that shows reasonable balance and character.

15190,US,"Whole berry fermentation and aging in neutral oak yield an aromatic, high-toned, fruity wine with a woody character—not new oak, but rather the flavor of neutral wood and gentle oxidation.

Apricots, pineapples, peaches and Meyer lemons are the fruits, framed by vanilla and smoke from new oak, and finishing with a minerality that must come from the earth.",,90,26.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Summers
15310,Italy,"As with many of the wines of Sandrone, it is easy to be beguiled by the fruit, and miss the underlying structure holding it together. This is true of the Dolcetto, where the wine initially shows plenty of dark fruit and a touch of mint, but gains a spicy complexity as it takes in air. The wine will benefit from a couple of years in the bottle, but is delicious now.",,90,22.0,Piedmont,Dolcetto d'Alba,,Dolcetto,Sandrone
15311,US,"Despite the extra bottle age, it's a very youthful, dense wine. The Malbec is battened down with spicy purple fruit flavors and compact tannins. The balance is acid-driven, and the presence of new oak is muted. Will the tannins soften before the fruit fades? It's worth socking a bottle or two away to find out.",Bunk House,90,50.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Smasne Cellars
15312,Austria,"Richness in a glass, this flows around the mouth, unctuous, velvety, a mouthful of honey. If the acidity is only just a hint, it doesn't matter, this is delicious now, and a seductive treat.",Beerenauslese,90,19.0,Burgenland,,,White Blend,Umathum
15313,New Zealand,"The Awatere is a subregion of Marlborough receiving more and more notice for its distinctive Sauvignons and Pinots. Vavasour was an early pioneer, and the 2007 is especially successful, offering up some slightly sweaty, nettle-y aromas to go along with hints of ripe melons and nectarines. It's nicely concentrated, with a slightly oily mouthfeel and good persistence.",,90,20.0,Awatere Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Vavasour

15315,US,"Mostly Pinot Noir with some Chardonnay, this bubbly shows the pedigree of these two noble varieties in its balance and elegance.

This is a great price for a sparkling wine of this quality and sophistication.",Blanc de Noirs,90,19.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sparkling Blend,Mumm Napa
15316,US,"This wine is formulaic in a good way; L'Ecole “owns” Sémillon in Washington, and it is hard to think of any winery in the country that does a better job with the grape. Aged sur lie in neutral oak, blended with 14% Sauvignon Blanc and put through malolactic for added creaminess, this is a delicious, rich and succulent wine that deftly mixes flavors of nettle, lime and melon with vanilla custard and a hint of butterscotch.",,90,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sémillon,L'Ecole No. 41
15317,Austria,"From the Scheiben vineyard, this Weissburgunder-(Pinot Blanc) based wine is dominated by its nutmeg spice even before the sweetness arrives. It is elegant, not hugely intense, but obviously very sweet. However, there is also a fine freshness here.",Scheiben Trockenbeerenauslese,90,50.0,Wagram-Donauland,,,Weissburgunder,Leth
15318,France,"Are delicate and full-bodied contradictions? Not here, with this ripe, red-fruit-flavored wine, which still creeps delicately around the palate.

15319,Italy,"A big, fat, jolly wine with many of the warm, friendly qualities of the '03 vintage. On the nose it shows dark jammy fruit, coffee and spices.

15320,US,"Here's Washington Syrah in the flesh, unadulterated, unblended, blasting out aromas of wild berries, spicy cranberry and rhubarb.

15321,US,"Amicus has been doing a good job over the years producing richly intense mountain-style Cabs. This one, from a warm vintage, is very ripe, showing lusty red and black currant flavors.

15322,Australia,"The famous E&E; Shiraz also comes in a sparkling version. There's no denying the quality of the 2001, which boasts bold aromas of toast, cedar, vanilla and blackberries. The mouthfeel is full, creamy and lush, and while it finishes a touch sweet, there's just enough tannin and acid to keep it balanced. Delicious now, but these wines can age 10 or more years from the vintage.",E&E; Sparkling,90,70.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Shiraz,Barossa Valley Estate
15323,US,"This is young, tangy, juicy and sweet, with ripe but quite tart fruit, showing plenty of acid and citrus rind. The toasty oak flavors are front and center, and delicious. All the Gamache red wines will benefit from additional bottle age, which will soften and meld the bacon fat, herb and sharp spice flavors. There is a lot of potential here for further development.",Estate,90,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Gamache
15324,Australia,"A tiny bottling (220 cases) of old-vine Grenache, this wine features lovely aromas of cinnamon, clove and ripe cherries.

15325,US,"Made entirely from Chardonnay, this is the most elegant and delicate of the winery's current bubblies. It's a dry, sophisticated wine, with subtle citrus, peach, apple and yeast flavors.

15326,US,"This debut blend somehow reaches 15% alcohol, not easy to do with Yakima Valley Sangiovese. It's a solid effort, which opens well—supple and polished, with pretty flavors of mixed plum and berry. It's silky, smooth and there's plenty of tangy fruit. The finish gets a little too hot, but that's a minor quibble in a wine that gives you this much flavor at this price. The finish keeps getting more and more interesting, piling on smoked ham and spicy clove as it goes.",,90,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Hestia
15327,US,"Only a fine, cool-climate vineyard could have grown this Pinot. It combines ripe raspberry, cherry and cola flavors with crispness and a delicate, silky mouthfeel. The end result is a dry, complex wine of considerable charm and a drink-me-again deliciousness.",Amber Ridge Vineyard,90,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Kindred
15328,Austria,"Smooth and rich, this is a big wine, initially almost Chardonnay-like in its creamy richness. But then the Riesling's fresh perfumes and intense acidity kick in. White berries follow, while there are hints of white pear. Age this wine for 5 years.",Heiligenstein Alte Reben,90,48.0,Kamptal,,,Riesling,Jurtschitsch
15329,Italy,"Began with unpleasant swampy aromas, but they blew off, revealing dark fruit, spices and an earthiness that had nothing to do with the initial smells.

15332,US,"Showing quite a bit of tannins and acids, this is a very young wine, of a kind that isn't seen all that much in Russian River Valley these days. Swan makes their Pinots the old-fashioned way, for aging. Dry and astringent, the wine has a deep core of cherry and blackberry fruit, almost like a Merlot, except for the silkiness.

15336,US,"Clean and varietal. The fruit tastes of ripe apples, pears, and maybe a little bit of pineapple, and if there is new oak it has been gracefully melded into the wine so it does not stick out. Just a hint of sweet toast adorns the smooth, lingering finish; then fades with a lick of butterscotch at the tail end. A graceful, elegant debut for this new Walla Walla winery.",Conner Lee Vineyards,90,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Sapphire Mountain Cellars
15337,US,"Dry, sauvage and nicely detailed, this bright, tart, citrusy wine has a truly great mouthfeel.

It's New World pomp and pleasantness in all its glory.",Reserva,90,18.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Norton
15340,Argentina,"This wine needs time to get its legs underneath it. It comes on young and rugged and gamy, but if you let it sit and air out for 20 minutes it turns deeper, riper and much more fruity. And by the time it settles you're smack dab in the middle of mountain berry and other natural flavors. Will get better with some bottle time.",,90,17.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Finca Sophenia

15343,Spain,"Sweet, succulent aromas draw you in and while the wine doesn't deliver much nuance on either the nose or palate, we can't quibble with the power, purity and intensity of the blackberry fruit.

15345,France,"A piercingly steely wine, all angles and acidity. That said, there's a greater depth of flavor that needs time to come out—the richness of the green fruit is there, as is the hint of wood. The corners need to soften for a year or so.",Montmain Premier Cru,90,33.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Joseph Drouhin
15346,US,"My experience of Swan Pinots is that they've been made the same way for a long time, and require aging. This one shows some hard tannins and even some tough acids, although it's tremendous in cherry-pie filling, black raspberry and blackberry jam flavors. Right now it feels juvenile, rude, even rustic, but five to eight years in the cellar will reward.",Trenton Estate Vineyard,90,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards

15350,Germany,"Kerner is a variety not often seen in the U.S., although it is among the top five most planted white grapes in Germany.

Despite the high (15.3%) alcohol, it is clean and bracing, with natural acids and very little heat in the finish. As young as it is, it hits a bit of a dead spot in the back, but it has the stuffing (and the pedigree) that would suggest that with a few years of cellaring it will open out and show more of the herb and smoked meat character that is lurking just below the surface.",Clifton Hill Vineyard,90,30.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Seia

15542,US,"If anyone can perfectly evoke the ripe style of California Cabernet along with the structure of Washington state fruit, it's Peter Rosback of Sineann – conveniently located in Oregon. Why this iconoclastic winemaker does not just move to Washington is hard to figure; he obviously loves the grapes and knows exactly what to do with them. This Cabernet Sauvignon, from a relatively young block at the Champoux vineyard, has some heat and chewy tannins.

15553,Italy,"Browning slightly at the edge, and already fully mature, this shows some pretty aromatics of strawberry, flowers and wintergreen mint.

15562,US,"Built for the cellar, this Cab is impressively deep in ripe currant, cherry, cocoa, milk chocolate and spice flavors.

15564,Austria,"The loess slopes of the Wagram give typically full-bodied Grüner Veltliner.

15568,Italy,"The winemakers at Giribaldi went for a more ambitious wine, with intense jammy fruit, licorice and earth.

15570,Germany,"A Riesling with an enticing nose of honeysuckle and other summer blossoms, stone fruit and focused stony minerality.

15573,US,"Pretty and complex, this delivers a mélange of interesting flavors. Round, tart fruits—berries and sour plum— mingle with dried leaves, cut tobacco and mushroom.

15579,US,"With delicious texture and concentration, this Lake County blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre from the 3,000-foot-high Fore Family Vineyard is intensely good, a deep reddish-purple blueberry-tinged infusion of earth and clove spice with dry, tight tannins and even a little lavender that'll linger. This one'll age, but is so convincingly reminiscent of the Northern Rhône right now, it'll be hard to wait.",Red Wine,92,28.0,California,Red Hills Lake County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,G-S-M,Peter Franus
15580,US,"Made in a jammy, soft but enormously rich style, this Syrah is almost like Port, except that it's dry. You'll want to sip it slowly, over time, to let it shape-shift in the glass. It offers waves of cherry pie filling, blackberry marmalade and cassis flavors, touched with sweetly smoked oak. Calls for very rich and elaborate beef and lamb dishes.",Rim Rock,92,46.0,California,California,California Other,Syrah,Piedrasassi
15581,US,"The 2008 vintage was cool and resulted in lighter-bodied wines that also were lower in alcohol. That trend benefited wines like this lovely one from Regale. It has a transparent, silky texture, yet is very rich in cherry pie filling, bacon and Indian spices. Feels beautiful and complex now, and should develop bottle nuance over the next six years.",O'Neel Vineyard,92,48.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Regale Winery and Vineyards
15582,Argentina,"Full, dense and dark, with powerful berry aromas and hints of rubber and leather on the bouquet. The palate breathes complexity and style but also raw power, and the flavors of blackberry, fig paste and herbs are just lusty and rich enough to register as modern Mendoza.

15583,Germany,"This auslese is less obviously fruity than many of Loosen's recent efforts, with a smoky, fuel-oil overlay to the honeyed and stone-like flavors. At only 7.5% alcohol, it's sweet yet not heavy, balanced by bright acidity and a hint of prickly CO2 still in evidence.

Shows how exceptional winemaking can result in exceptional wine.",,92,19.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Vina Robles
15586,US,"This is a delicious wine. The blackberry and cherry jam, chocolate, anise and pepper flavors have a pie filling richness, complete with the smoky-sweet pastry crust. Yet it's totally dry.

15587,US,"Tastes young and drily tannic now, with an enormous core of blackberries and black cherries. A complex wine to take note of. If you drink it now, decant. Otherwise, give it 3–4 years to do its thing.",Alisos Vineyard,92,36.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Syrah,La Fenêtre
15588,US,"Made in a light-bodied, lower-alcohol style, this Pinot feels silky and gentle in the mouth. It really delivers when it comes to flavor.

Drink now and over the next four years.",La Cruz Vineyard,92,44.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller Estate
15589,US,"This baby Cabernet plays tricks on the palate, showing appealing soft, delicious complexity, then retreating into a cloak of tannins, and then emerging again with sweet fruit and spice. It's bone dry, although the cherries and blackberries show a baked-into-the-pie caramelized sweetness.

15592,US,"This first release from the winery is a fine Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Franc.

The attractive nose features ripe yellow stone fruit with strong mineral overtones, while the palate reveals enough crisp, refreshing acidity to balance the sweetness.

15597,US,"The Laurène–Drouhin Family Estate Reserve brings a bit more earthiness to the table than the regular DDO bottling. In the mouth, the fruit—a delicate jumble of raspberry, pomegranate, cranberry and sour cherry—mingles with streaks of caramel, herb and leaf.

15599,US,"From a producer to watch in underrated Lodi, this intense, black cherry, bacon-fat and white peppery Syrah has an almost peat-like, whisky aroma at first, very inviting, which then leads into more bacon and pepper that carries through on the palate, balanced by extremely smooth tannins and an unexpected elegance. A really cool Syrah to try on its own that'll go very nicely with meaty, wintery foods.",Farrah,91,20.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Syrah,Klinker Brick
15600,Italy,"This Negroamaro-Aglianico blend opens slowly, then suddenly releases a rush of red cherry, toast, prune, leather and red earth.

15601,Argentina,"If you don't mind a little overt wood on your Malbec, then this will certainly do the trick and more. The nose offers some maple and mature berry aromas, while the palate pumps oak-infused black cherry fruit. Lengthy on the finish, with mocha and vanilla.

15602,US,"The chardonnay is the largest production wine made at Barnard Griffin. It is a stellar wine, about half barrel fermented, the other half stainless; a beautiful blend of crisp, fresh, creamy, leesy, textural white peach and light citrus fruit. Consistent in style with the winery's Fumé the Chardonnay has plenty of clean acid, great fruit, and a nice butterscotch finish in the back of the throat.",,90,10.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Barnard Griffin
15603,US,"This is a smooth blend of Red Mountain and Horse Heaven Hills Merlot, with a generous (18%) supplement of Cabernet Sauvignon. It's consistent with previous efforts and reminiscent of Reininger—satiny smooth, glossy and somewhat impenetrable. The tightly wound fruits taste of ripe raspberry, and the bright acidity adds intensity to the toasty, coffee-inflected finish. The wine is dense, supple and extracted, with hints of spice, herb, lemon thyme and citrusy high tones.",,90,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Hightower
15604,US,"Dry, tannic and concentrated, a fierce, almost feral wine, but it's classic in the way of California mountain Zins. Floods the mouth with blackberry essence, wrapped into strong tannins and finishing with a crisp burst of acidity. Compelling and complex, it cries out for a rustic beef or pork dish, long simmered and well-seasoned.",,90,28.0,California,Rockpile,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Hobo
15605,Austria,"A rare find in Austria, this shows the potential of Viognier. Flavors of apricot liqueur, summer flower aromas, and concentration come together to make a rich, powerful wine. Because Viognier is not approved as a varietal in Austria, this is sold as a non-vintage table wine, but in fact this wine is from the 2004 vintage.",V,90,54.0,Austria,,,Viognier,Graf Hardegg
15606,US,"The fruit comes from Weinbau, DuBrul and Destiny Ridge. The Weinbau is old vine, and is the main component. This is a solid, meaty, deep purple and blue, with hints of smoked meat in the nose. Fruit flavors are tight, tart and run to the black cherry and blackberry flavors. Clearly varietal, with stiff tannins, a bit  chalky, but plenty of varietal character and a long finish with streaks of coffee and light herb. This is winemaker Ron Coleman's favorite red, and he gives it plenty of TLC that shines through in the bottle.",,90,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Franc,Tamarack Cellars
15607,US,"The grapes got real ripe, to judge by the bright burst of yellow apricots and exotic passionfruits. At the same time, acidity is crisp and citrusy, and there's a pleasant yeasty character, like Champagne, or a nice fino Sherry. The wine finishes totally dry, leaving a palate impression of great elegance. Drink now through 2010.",Porter-Bass Vineyard,90,48.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Tandem
15608,US,"This is certainly a better Chard than the winery's '04. It's richer and more succulent, overall more rewarding in varietal fruit, including peaches and cream, pineapples, guavas and papayas, with a cinnamon spice finish. The wine also is characterized by crisp, crunchy acidity that makes it racy.",,90,18.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Chardonnay,Sequoia Grove
15609,Italy,"Here is a dense and intense Primitivo with exotic spice, clove, ground cinnamon and nutmeg backed by plump red fruit and toasted notes.

It should age well, its richness giving it the right structure.",Smaragd Kollmitz,90,22.0,Wachau,,,Grüner Veltliner,Machherndl
15611,US,"Lots to like in this Cab Franc. Shows ripe, attractive cherry compote, black raspberry purée, cola, cocoa, coffee and spice flavors, with a rich, earthy edge of balsamic, sautéed mushroom and oaky vanilla.

Very nice wine, but be sure to decant it for a few hours.",Reserve,90,19.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Cabernet Franc,Ironstone
15612,US,"Concentrated and showing a whiff of volatility, this is a blend of 62% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and a splash each of Cab Franc and Petit Verdot. Grapes are sourced from three different estate vineyards on Red Mountain. It's acidic and extracted, but opens up with exposure to air into a supple, rich, muscular, raspberry and cherry-flavored red blend.

15613,US,"Dark, dense, ripe and oaky, this ramps up the oak flavors to higher levels, with rich layers of smoke, cedar, honey and butterscotch wrapped into the spicy, sweet fruit. As the wine ages and opens up the lovely cherry/cassis core fruit should come into the spotlight. Call it a Washington take on ripe, high-octane California reds.",Red Mountain,90,50.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Hightower
15614,Spain,"Sweet and welcoming; a good deal among pedigreed red wines. The nose on this 100% Monastrell from older vines is mammoth, toasty and dark, while the palate is chunky and virtually melts with blackberry, plum and cherry flavors. A real-deal red with breadth and class. 1,000 cases made.",,90,16.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Monastrell,Juan Gil
15615,US,"Here's a dry Chardonnay, notable for its firm structure. Acidity and oak tannins provide the framework for the candied Meyer lemon, mango, floral, mineral and buttered toast flavors. There's a touch of bitterness in the finish that suggests very modest aging. Drink now through 2008.",Quenneville Vineyard,90,35.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Byington
15616,Argentina,"Few Argentinean wineries are doing everyday red wines better than Chakana. A case in point is this excellent, superbly balanced, easy-drinking Cab.

It's fruity more than complex, with stature and style.",,90,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chakana
15617,Argentina,"Color, power, flavor and commendable balance; that's pretty much the format for Punto Final, one of Argentina's go-to brands for Malbec.

If it seems a little young and clumsy upon pouring, air it out and it'll improve.",Punto Final,90,11.0,Mendoza Province,Perdriel,,Malbec,Bodega Renacer
15618,US,"A classic Bordeaux blend (about 30% each Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot, the rest Petite Verdot) This wine is still locked up tight upon release. There is metallic minerality underpinning the tart, austere fruit, but there are also surprising high notes of brandied cherries, and a sense of depth missing in more ordinary wines. This is definitely a wine to cellar for up to a decade. As always, this is sensitive, detailed winemaking.",Ciel du Cheval,90,30.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Seven Hills
15619,US,"This is one of the riper of Siduri's crop of '05 single-vineyard Pinots. It bursts with cherry jam, sweet cola, vanilla and coffee fudge flavors that make it delicious, but it's no mere fruit bomb. The complex of acids, tannins and oak give it dimensions worth pondering. Best now and for five years.",Van der Kamp Vineyard,90,42.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Siduri
15620,US,"This doesn't disappoint. It's a Cabernet-based blend, with Merlot and Syrah.

15622,US,"Easily the richest of Schug's current trio of Chards, showing the elegance and crispness of the other bottlings, but with more fruity intensity.

15625,US,"Califa is the winery's highest designation, kind of a reserve, and this Syrah is oakier and riper than the regular Chamisal bottling, although fully as dry.

15626,US,"A 50/50 Cab/Merlot blend from Pepper Bridge, this is quite tight and reductive but grudgingly opens out. It's a stiff, hard wine, layered with blueberry, raspberry and cassis, and annotated with baker's chocolate and anise. Dark and unyielding, it has the muscle and authority to age for another six or eight years. There's a hint of green tea in the chewy tannins.",Pepper Bridge,89,,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Hightower
15627,Spain,"This muscular youth proves that Priorat can deliver fleshy, modern wines. Or maybe it's the 20% Merlot that's softenening the Garnacha and Carignan.

Plump and easygoing.",,88,25.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Punters Corner
15632,US,"From the cool Green Valley, a wine that didn't get quite ripe this year. There are citrus flavors alongside bell pepper ones and the taste of various herbs.

15639,US,"Jam-packed with bright fruit flavors of peaches, pears and tropical fruits, and spiced up with the vanilla and toast notes of oak. This is a rich wine, big and bold, and a real crowd pleaser.",Wildwood Vineyard - Estate Bottled,87,22.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kunde
15640,France,"The vintage Moët seems a bit sugary, with broad, simple flavors. It's a blocky wine; a bit of citrus here, some butterscotch there, and that sugary kick to the finish. Just a bit too paint-by-the-numbers.",Brut Impérial,87,53.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Moët & Chandon
15641,Australia,"Shy is not how to describe this wine's bold, plump, grapey bouquet, which features a good dose of bacon. The palate is flavorful and fruity, but it's also one-dimensional in that it's all fruit and no nuance or layering. The smooth finish has coffee and black fruit in full quantities.",Koonunga Hill,87,11.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,,Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon,Penfolds
15642,US,"After all these years, Mayacamas still marches to a different drummer. Not for them flamboyant fruit or a heavy plaster of oak. You won't find tropical fruits, scads of spices and vanilla. This wine is tight and earthy, and the dryness is not offset with glycerin or other pseudo-sugars. It's earthy and austere. The point is ageability, if you care to cellar it.",,87,32.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Mayacamas
15643,US,"This Rhône-inspired blend of Viognier and Roussanne certainly has a lot of fruit, filling the mouth with white peaches, sweet green apples and honeyed spearmint flavors, yet it's quite dry and crisp, and finishes with a lively, clean aftertaste.",Los Robles Viejos Rozet,87,24.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,White Blend,Edmunds St John

15645,France,"Salty, even briny scents dominate, along with a slightly resinous character. In the mouth this is a flavorful, rather heavy wine which carries its weight and power in the dead center of the palate. Nothing elegant here, but it's a good mouthful of fruit, finishing with an herbal-metallic note.",Grande Cuvée Brut,87,21.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Charles Lafitte

15647,France,"This big, friendly wine shows ripe, forward scents of mixed citrus and light tropical fruits, along with toasted nuts.

15650,Australia,"They say the vines date to 1889. The color is inky black. The aromas are impressive and promising. White chocolate, blackberry, cassis, licorice and white pepper begin to describe them. It's a hugely extracted wine, packed with berry flavors, very dry, with substantial tannins. It's far too big to describe as elegant—rustic does it more justice. The winemaker suggests aging until 2006. He may be short of the mark.",Tricentenary,87,30.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Grenache,Yalumba

Crisp acidity keeps it clean and vibrant on the palate.",,87,15.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Valley of the Moon
15652,US,"Another good value from this winery. The apple and peach flavors have something dusty about them, like dry, red California dirt on a hot summer day. Just a little oak spices up this dry and crisp wine.",,87,16.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Wild Horse
15653,US,"This is a hands-on wine filled with everything toasty oak and lees can add. The underlying flavors are fairly lean, suggesting citrus fruits and a hint of green apple.

15655,US,"A very rich, oaky-toasty wine with oodles of upfront peach and tropical fruit flavors, but not a lot of depth or complexity.

15656,US,"Sweet stuff, with flavors of butterscotch, vanilla and custard. The basic fruit flavors are peaches and pears. No problem getting the grapes superripe in this warm California region.

15669,France,"The dosage level is 45g/l, which makes this wine a bit sweet, but not cloying. Toast and candied citron aromas and some honeyed apple and lemon flavors.

Contains 15% Viognier and 10% Chardonnay.",Amado Sur,85,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,White Blend,Trivento

15739,US,"Estate-grown, tart and tasting of citrus and green apple fruits. Despite the high acidity and generous (13.2%) alcohol, there is an impression of some sweetness.

15742,Argentina,"Big, roasted and full, with slightly earthy, burnt aromas to go with standard berry fruit. The palate is solid in feel, with herbal berry and tea flavors along with zesty acidity.

15744,Spain,"Smells sort of gummy and candied, with aromas of red licorice stick, raisin and raspberry jam.

15745,US,"This Cab has some nice things going on in its velvety mouthfeel, but it's rather jammy-fruity and chocolatey, like a Starbucks coffee-based drink with a squirt of raspberry syrup.

15747,Spain,"Lightly stemmy and brambly, with lean red fruit aromas, a touch of saline and red licorice candy.

15748,US,"Starts off with a funky, sweaty aroma that's slightly troubling, but not overpowering.

15749,Spain,"This is the prototype for an over-the-top, roasted, charred Tempranillo. The nose smells directly of burnt coffee, charcoal and grilled beef.

This is his entry-level wine, and it's gorgeous, with a touch of sweetness and slightly rounder acidity than last year's version (which, incidentally, is still going strong).

15753,US,"Easily deserves its high score due to the ripe cassis flavors and near-perfect tannins. Caresses and seduces the palate with the soft velvety intensity of a fine liqueur.

15758,US,"Exceedingly dark, and starts off closed and mute, a difficult wine to evaluate in its youth. If you open it now, give it plenty of airing.

15759,US,"Another polished, succulent release from a vineyard that's not supposed to be warm enough to ripen Cabernet.

15763,US,"Made in a classic Napa style, with pronounced aromas of cassis and blackcurrant and a considerably layering of well-charred, toasty oak.

15767,Australia,"Well balanced and medium bodied, this isn't a biting-acids, oyster-ready sort of Riesling. Instead, it's rather feminine, with pretty sunflower, honey and peach fuzz flavors swathed in chalk. The nose has nice, waxy yellow melon and citrus notes.

15768,Italy,"Well oaked and woodsy, with some earthy nuances as well as scents of campfire and rubber. This is a youngster with aggressive tannins and sharp edges.

15773,US,"Another fine vintage for this veteran Napa winery. Shows a classic Napa character, with ripe flavors of cassis and blackcurrants and finely-ground, complex but easy tannins.

It's a blend of 70% Cabernet and 30% Sangiovese, and it shows patented dried-fruit, leather and caramel aromas, a peppery, cherry palate, and some light oak on the finish.

15794,US,"The blend is 51% Merlot, the rest divided among five other grapes, including Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec.

Some barrel spice adds cinnamon to the nose, and there's a touch of Cab Franc (6%) in the blend, which stiffens up the tannins.

15818,Italy,"A skillful blending of 50% Barbera and 50% Nebbiolo, the Cogno has lovely wild strawberry aromas, cranberry and a touch of licorice.

15820,France,"This must be one of the most familiar nonvintage Champagnes, so it's good to be able to report that it is much improved.

15824,US,"This 50-50 blend from two well-established vineyards is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Young and stiff and still quite tannic, it shows compact cassis and blackberry fruit with an earthy underpinning, a hint of stem that adds some bite to the tannins.

15898,Argentina,"Mauricio Lorca makes wine for Enrique Foster but his private label is something to keep an eye on. Poetico is potent and fairly pure; and it contains 10% Cabernet and 5% Syrah in addition to 85% Malbec. The palate delivers hearty blackberry, plum and vanilla flavors, while the finish is sturdy as a statue, with length and firm tannins.",Poetico,89,21.0,Mendoza Province,Vista Flores,,Malbec,Mauricio Lorca

15902,US,"There are intense black cherry aromas, pure and simple, in this very dry and fairly tannic wine.  Your tongue sticks to the palate while picks up a solid core of that cherry fruit.

15903,US,"You can taste the earth, heat and sunshine in this strong and slightly sweet Zin.

15905,Argentina,"This straightforward apple and toast-dominated Chardonnay has medium weight and decent length. It's decidedly mainstream, a bit too one-dimensionally so. But it's still tasty in that mode, and oak-lovers will savor the spicy wood that comes up very strongly on the close.

15908,US,"So young, fresh and frisky, it's a puppy of a wine, filled with exuberant wild-berry flavors, especially red ones, like red rasberry and strawberry.

15917,US,"Smells raw and stemmy, with green wood aromas.  In the mouth, it;s dry, as you'd expect.  Not much flavor, for those accustomed to ripe fruit.  It' a structural wine, meant to go with food, and could be nice with, say, a lamb curry, which would bring out the hidden sweetness.  If you're careful about pairing, it's a nice wine.

15919,US,"Smells forward and ripe, with wild berry, bramble, and blueberry aromas and an array of crushed, dust oriental Spices.  On the palate, it's awkward, somewhat hot, with 15% alcohol and some overripe, raisiny flavors that are Port-like.

While hardly perfect, there's enough true Pinot character here to make it worthwhile.",,84,23.0,Martinborough,,,Pinot Noir,Te Kairanga

15983,US,"This has zesty acidity that lends a mouthwatering briskness to the citrus, peach and spice flavors. Easy to like as a cocktail sipper, or paired with Chinese food and tempura.",,88,22.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Pinot Grigio,Benessere
15984,Italy,"The thick, oily texture is backed by aroflavors of stone fruit, honeysuckle and passion fruit. This is a generous and bold wine.",Sanct Valentin,88,38.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Gewürztraminer,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano
15985,Spain,"This opens with sweet, compact aromas of raisin and spice. It feels more perky and crisp in the mouth, with a slight acidic cut and flavors of roasted berry, herb and chocolate. The finish is lightly herbal and minty, with peppery spice and plenty of length. A classic Bordeaux blend of roughly one-third each of Cabernet, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.",,88,19.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Aljibes
15986,Austria,"A smooth and creamy wine, with a rich, fruity baked-apple character, and tense, tangy acidity. There is a touch of pepper that offers contrast. Drinkable now, this is also worth aging. Screwcap.",Strassertaler,88,,Kamptal,,,Grüner Veltliner,Allram
15987,US,"Still quite young, this 100% Cabernet Franc shows great promise with more cellar aging. It's respectful of what that grape can do, with smoky overtones amid layers of green olive, cedar and pepper. The finish has a bite of minty cocoa.",Bill's Block,88,28.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,Cabernet Franc,Andis
15988,US,"The cool vintage shows in the brisk acidity, hard tannins and herb and mineral flavors that accompany the usual blackberries and spices. There's plenty of elegance, with the wine showing a highly refined structure. Drink now–2014.",Watch Hill Vineyard,88,30.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Syrah,Andrew Murray
15989,France,"Big and rounded, this has layers of caramel and strawberry flavors. The fruit is ripe and forward, with delicious acidity and a soft, honeyed aftertaste.",Grande Réserve,88,23.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,,Rosé,Château de Saint-Martin
15990,US,"Give this Cab extra points for the dazzle factor. It shows the most beautifully ripe flavors of blackberries and cassis, and a powerful but tasty coating of smoky oak. The tannins are so sweet and fine, but the excessive softness robs the wine of structure.",Reserve,88,95.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ledson
15991,Austria,"Whites from red wine specialist Umathum are rare, but then so is Pinot Gris in Austria. This wine has a racy quality, topped with spice that sets it apart from its nearest comparison, Alsace. There is a touch of wood as well as the spice, lively and fresh to finish.",,88,25.0,Burgenland,,,Grauburgunder,Umathum
15992,US,"Lots of zesty Carneros acidity in this young Pinot that impresses for its silkiness and ripe fruit flavors. Cherries, raspberries, cola, vanilla and mint, finely etched and pure, are the flavors, with a dry, spicy finish. Drink now–2008.",,88,35.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Mayro-Murdick
15993,US,"Here's an intense, nervy young Cab that impresses for its powerful oak and cassis flavors. It's a little sharp now, with an acidic jamminess and tea-like tannic structure that suggests moderate aging capability. Stash it until 2008, then open for a couple of years.",Reserve,88,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Raymond
15994,Austria,"From a vineyard right in the city of Krems, this Grüner is all spice and mineral; very fresh, elegant, green and crisp. It's probably an early drinking wine, delicious now and for the next 3–4 years. Glass stopper.",Wieden Tradition,88,22.0,Kremstal,,,Grüner Veltliner,Salomon-Undhof
15995,Italy,"Pio Cesare's Langhe 2004 is more open and easier to taste than the 2003. The nose is big and plummy with a strong floral component, while on the palate, the fruit possesses an inner core of bright strawberry giving the wine a nice lift in the finish.",,88,30.0,Piedmont,Nebbiolo d'Alba,,Nebbiolo,Pio Cesare
15996,US,"With 20% Semillon, this is a very rich wine, partly barrel-fermented and aged on the lees. It's packed with ripe, fruity peaches, pineapples, green apples, melons, figs and dates. It's a little sweet, but zesty acidity comes to the rescue to provide balance and elegance.",,88,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Duckhorn
15997,US,"This is a tight, rather austere style of Merlot, but has muscle and nerve. Winemaker Charlie Hoppes has kept a slightly green edge to the tannins, which are well-managed and taste good, while adding length and firmness to the back end.",Estate,88,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Gamache
15998,France,"This wine is beginning to get some age to it, but remains fresh. There is some toast, even coffee, while the aftertaste is soft and slightly candied.",Blanc de Blancs,88,48.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Duval-Leroy
15999,US,"This is sharply perfumed, with an edgy, tight consistency that seems to emphasize both the floral and the bitter rind aspects of the grape. Viognier can fall off a cliff rapidly, and this latest vintage, though complex and complicated, has a hot intensity that pulls in the bitterness and loses the citrus. If that's the style you like, this is a fine, concentrated and intense rendition.",,88,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Viognier,Alexandria Nicole
16000,US,"Cool fermented in stainless steel and whole cluster pressed, this lively take on Pinot Gris offers rich pear fruit flavors, succulent and fresh. It's a big, ripe, solid effort, with a lovely juicy quality that fills the mouth with a burst of just-picked flavor.",,88,14.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Pinot Gris,Lost River
16001,Austria,"Full and rich, maybe missing some acidity, but replacing that with powered white nectarines. The pepper, though, causes the wine to fall short, giving it an edge. It needs time to develop properly—give it 2–3 years at least.",Smaragd Steinterrassen,88,30.0,Wachau,,,Riesling,Machherndl
16002,Austria,"A lively, fresh wine that only just borders on sweetness, reserving some the botrytised fruit for richness instead. There are fine flavors of lychees, crispened up with white currants, while spice comes through but well in balance.",Schenkenbichl Auslese,88,34.0,Kamptal,,,Grüner Veltliner,Jurtschitsch
16003,US,"There are some exquisite flavors in this Cab Franc: cassis, cherries, raspberries, cocoa, smoky oak and a rich array of dusty crushed brown spices. The wine is fully dry, with finely meshed tannins, but the main quibble is that it's too soft to be completely balanced.",,88,48.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Franc,Ledson
16004,France,"This is a heavy, rather clumsy wine, that seems to be too soft. The weight shows through the almonds and green plum fruits, while the acidity seems somewhat forced. To finish, the softness returns. Bottle age may help this wine to liven up.",Fleur de Champagne Brut,88,140.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Perrier Jouët
16005,France,"The softness of the 1999 vintage is very apparent in this approachable wine. It is full, round, only just touched by minerality, white fruits and some almonds giving weight and character.",Cuvée Millesimé Grand Cru Brut,88,62.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Chardonnay,Pierre Moncuit

16007,US,"This is Côtes-du-Rhône, California style. A blend of Grenache, Mourvedre, Syrah and Counoise, it's a dry, rich, full-bodied red wine, flooded with easy-to-drink cherry, blackberry, blueberry and oak flavors, and a wealth of Provençal rosemary, lavender and thyme. Drink now for its soft, youthful purity.",Côtes de Tablas,88,20.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend,Tablas Creek

16009,New Zealand,"Blends ripe tropical fruit—even including hints of mango and banana—with more pungent notes in a full-bodied, almost sweet-seeming Sauvignon Blanc. Flashy upfront, then fades a bit on the finish.",Falveys,88,21.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Omaka Springs
16010,US,"Apex has just released this 2002, which makes it, as far as we know, the last of that vintage to see daylight. Dark and smoky, it is already heading into more mature, secondary fruit flavors, and has a pleasing softness throughout. Time has sanded away the rough edges of the tannins, and rounded out the herbal components as well. This is drinking very nicely, and gives you a cellared wine at a new wine price.",,88,30.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Merlot,Apex
16011,US,"Sonoma Valley Cabernet specialist Cohn reaches to the Russian River to expand his portfolio with this Pinot Noir. It's not a stretch to call it Bordeaux-style. Although it has the variety's telltale silkiness and medium body, the blackberry, cola, coffee, leather and oak flavors, not to mention the tannins, possess density and gravity, which may make this wine ageable. Best now through 2011.",,88,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,B.R. Cohn
16012,US,"Better known for Cabernet Sauvignon, Charles Krug has a good track record for Merlot, too, and their '04 is quite a rich wine.

16013,New Zealand,"Nicely concentrated, with dense fruit flavors packed into a refined package. Melon, fig and grapefruit aromas and flavors finish long, picking up hints of smoke and herbs. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Reserve,88,17.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Brancott

16015,France,"An intensely herbal, thyme-flavored wine, with a creaminess that enhances the full, but still very fresh character.

16017,US,"This is Duckhorn's signature vineyard for Merlot, located off the Silverado Trail below Calistoga. It's also the winery's most variable Merlot, showing distinct vintage variation. The 2004 was a warm vintage, and the wine is soft and voluptuous in pie-filling cherry, raspberry and blackberry flavors. But it doesn't have the tough tannins that cooler vintages show.",Three Palms Vineyard,88,85.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Duckhorn
16018,Italy,"The Il Falchetto offers lovely aromas of fresh peach, honeysuckle and lime peel. The palate is more delicate but the wine is beautifully balanced, and initially, there is more than enough intensity of flavor. But as it moves towards the finish, it begins to run out of steam.",,88,21.0,Piedmont,Langhe,,Arneis,Il Falchetto
16019,US,"This estate-grown Cabernet shows good concentration and a stylish mix of fruit, leaf and herb across the palate. There are subtle notes of tomato leaf, bark and earth, along with black currant and blackberry fruit. The tannins are smoky and substantial, with a green tea edge to them. The wine is finished at under 14% alcohol, and it captures the sort of varietal character that cannot be found in superripe, superhot New World wines.",,88,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gordon Brothers
16020,US,"A home run. Given extra bottle age, this is drinking optimally at the moment, with a spicy, brambly nose mixing blackberries, mint and chocolate-covered cherries. There's a scent of fresh cut wood also, and a mouthful of fruit and barrel flavors that are both nicely integrated and complementary. The long finish lingers into a resonant note of black tea.",Cali's Cuvée,91,24.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Left Coast Cellars
16021,France,"A big, bold wine with fine acidity and firm dark black tannins. It has proper weight, richness as well as a big structure. The core is dense, mineral, tight. Drink now, but could age for several years.",Mon Adour,91,17.0,Southwest France,Madiran,,Tannat,Lionel Osmin & Cie
16022,US,"Cabernet from Oakville for under $20? Yes, and it's a really good one. It's dry and full bodied and rich in classic blackberries and cassis.

16023,US,"Released at seven years of age, this Syrah is soft, tannic and dry. It has rich flavors of blackberries and blueberries, and seems far younger than it is. It's interesting and complex, and grows in the glass. Could go for a few more years.",,91,36.0,California,California,California Other,Syrah,Piedrasassi
16024,Italy,"One of Sicily's best expressions of Syrah, Planet's rich and velvety wine offers elegant aromas of blackberry, cherry, smoked ham and crushed white pepper. The wine is smooth and long on the finish with loads of chocolate intensity.",,91,40.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Syrah,Planeta
16025,Italy,"Here's a smooth and saturated Chard that beams strong with the Sicilian sunshine within. The bouquet opens with warm aromas of yellow rose, stone fruit, almond and creamy vanilla. In the mouth, it shows rich, full flavors that would pair with shellfish or white meat.",,91,40.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Chardonnay,Planeta
16026,US,"There's an odd plastic note here. Firm and compact, with unyielding fruit; black cherry, leaf and black tea flavors dominate. This seems closed down even after being open for several hours.",Domaine Danielle Laurent,91,50.0,Oregon,Yamhill-Carlton District,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Soléna
16027,South Africa,"A heady and concentrated Cab-based blend with 30% Shiraz and 9% Merlot. Intense aromas of blackberry, cassis, cedar spice and rich espresso grinds fill the bouquet, while black cherry, plum, cured meat and soft bramble unfold in the mouth. Full and tightly structured with firm tannins and a lingering finish; drink now to 2012.",Estate,91,40.0,Stellenbosch,,,Red Blend,Rust en Vrede
16028,US,"Like it says, this Riesling is bone dry. It's also crisp in acidity, with a tang of minerals and steel. It gains richness from a rich core of lemon, lime and orange citrus flavors, and possesses that note of diesel that a fine, cool climate Riesling shows. Should develop over the next six years.",Dry,91,22.0,California,Oak Knoll District,Napa,Riesling,Trefethen
16029,South Africa,"This is a gorgeous Bordeaux-style blend that grabs you right from the start with a decadent nose of black currant liqueur, toasted coconut, black cherry, cedar and a hint of purple African violet florals. The mouth is round but not fat, with a firm but not unyielding structure followed by a toffee-kissed finish that lingers endlessly. Drink now–2015.",Estate Reserve (Trilogy),91,30.0,Stellenbosch,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Warwick
16030,US,"Trisaetum is making some of the most exciting Rieslings in Oregon; now it can add Pinot Noir to its hit list. Estate grown, elegant and showing more than a little new French oak, this toasty wine drinks like a young Chambolle-Musigny. The tannins are sculpted and firm; the fruit ripe and racy with a mélange of red berries and currants. Give this more time in the bottle to absorb the new oak and shed some of the herbal aromas.",Estate,91,75.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Trisaetum
16031,US,"This is a truly appealing wine that seduces with chocolate-covered cherry flavors and soft, inviting tannins. The balance and concentration are all in proportion, with no reliance on too much new oak (just 25% first use) for the flavor. Details of spice and fresh tarragon enliven the aftertaste.",Estate 777 Block,91,45.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Arbor Brook
16032,US,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux blend is very rich and elaborate, a major league hitter for its spectacular fruit and tannins. The flavors are deep and concentrated, suggesting perfectly ripened blackberries, cassis and milk chocolate, with a minerality that must come from the soil. It's also very soft, in the modern style.",The Puzzle,91,80.0,California,Napa,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Newton
16033,US,"Balanced and fresh, with a mix of pear, quince, melon and apple, lightly dusted with baking spices, this appealing Pinot Gris is a fine match for salmon, halibut, and other Northwest seafood.

16035,Germany,"Inviting layered aromas of ripe stone fruit, hints of citrus and some earthy spice and minerality. Crisp and refreshing.

Medium sweet and balanced with a long finish.",Bernkasteler Doctor Kabinett,91,44.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef)
16036,Germany,"Nicely layered, with inviting fusel notes, ripe yellow fruit and honey aromas. Very minerally. Deliciously crisp, juicy and focused with a nicely taut palate.

16037,US,"Awfully good, a wine that strikes you right off the bat as important and complex. It's dry and densely packed in blackberry and cherry pie filling, red currant, licorice and sweet, smoky oak flavors. Very good and rich, with complicated tannins, and soft enough to drink now, although it should age well.",Red Rock Terrace,91,175.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Diamond Creek
16038,US,"Cofermented with about 3% Viognier, this estate-grown Syrah is done in a style quite different from anywhere else on the West Coast. It's racy and almost delicate, with none of the jammy fruit of California or the funk of Washington. But what it does have is grace and detail—starting with plums and cherries and bringing in loads of spice and chocolate, hints of coffee grounds and a whiff of tobacco. It's all elegantly displayed, lingering and polished, with surprising length.",Estate,91,30.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Southern Oregon,Syrah,Abacela
16039,Italy,"This is a lovely and sophisticated expression of Petit Verdot from Sicily with elegant graphite and mineral tones that back plum, prune, spice and loads of toasted nut. The wine is aged 16 month in oak, so those spice and smoke tones are also evident on the tasty finish.",Carduni,91,53.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Petite Verdot,Baglio di Pianetto

16041,US,"La Fenetre scores with this lush, forward Pinot Noir that offers enough flavor to please almost anybody. It's enormously rich in raspberry and cherry pie filling, roasted almond granola, vanilla cream, buttered cinnamon toast and sandalwood flavors that are so delicious, they're sweet, except that the wine finishes dry. Great with lamb. Drink now.",Le Bon Climat Vineyard,91,59.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,La Fenêtre

16043,Germany,"A delicate nose of complex aromas with striking stony minerality goes alongside aromas of honeysuckle, white lilac, elder flower and white peach. Very taut yet filigreed on the palate, this pale, lemon-colored wine is sweet, yet crisp and poised. Ample juicy ripe fruit flavors persist across the palate and lead to a long and layered, refreshing finish.",Graacher Himmelreich Auslese,91,,Mosel,,,Riesling,Joh. Jos. Prüm
16044,US,"With its dryness and firm tannins, there's lots of structural integrity in this Cab. New oak adds the right suggestions of toast and wood spices. It's an elegantly streamlined wine whose nuanced berry, cherry and currant flavors won't overwhelm a beautiful cut of beef.",,91,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Volker Eisele Family Estate
16045,Germany,"Complex, intense nose of fresh honeysuckle, tangerines, marmalade, spice, dried apricots, golden raisins and an earthy minerality abound.

16047,Austria,"Reserve wines from Kremstal offer a rich character and this wine, with its intense ripe yellow fruits, fits the bill. It does have an edge of steel and minerality, although its round, creamy style is likely to emerge more as it ages.",Steiner Kögl Reserve,91,28.0,Kremstal,,,Riesling,Salomon-Undhof
16048,US,"This is the reserve, a barrel selection limited to just 100 cases. The selection was done well and is meaningful; this has more grip and body than the excellent Estate 777 Pinot Noir that precedes it in price. A mix of Northwest berries define the fruit, set against moderately stiff tannins with suggestions of caramel from the oak aging. Put this one in the cellar.",Vintner's Select,91,60.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Arbor Brook
16049,South Africa,"A gorgeous and elegant compositionally undisclosed red blend from winemaker Kevin Grant, this has all the finesse and complexity of a great wine.

Silky in the mouth with fine tannins and a long, nuanced finish. Drink now.",Serenity,91,30.0,Western Cape,,,Red Blend,Ataraxia
16050,US,"This is a wonderful Merlot, dark and plummy. The nose introduces a round, warm entrance, with hints of leather, wood, herb and spice.

Smooth to a fault, and quite delicious.",Canoe Ridge Estate,89,22.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Merlot,Chateau Ste. Michelle
16051,US,"This is yet another superripe, rich and luscious Chardonnay from Chateau Ste. Michelle. It's a tropical fruit-flavored California take on Washington terroir.

Michelle
16052,US,"Mainly Cab Sauvignon, unusually blended with some Argentine Malbec, this is a dark, full-bodied, dry wine, rich and long in fruit.

16053,Spain,"Spicy and savory smelling, with interesting aromas that encompass maple, chili powder, smoked meat and mildly baked berries.

16054,Argentina,"In the past this was a Bordeaux blend but now it's all or almost all Malbec. And because it hails from cooler Tupungato it features floral aromas more than heavy berry scents, and in the mouth it's all about red fruit as opposed to beefy black fruit. If it's a bit short on the finish, chalk that up to its racier, more streamlined frame.",Synthesis,89,25.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Malbec,Finca Sophenia
16055,Australia,"Perennially one of Western Australia's best Rieslings, this is a medium-bodied effort that's deceptively light on its feet for having 13.5% alcohol. Aromas of flowers, wet stone and live ferns meld easily into hard-to-pin-down flavors that finish crisp and refreshing. Imported by USA Wine West.",Isolation Ridge Vineyard,89,19.0,Western Australia,Frankland River,,Riesling,Frankland Estate

16057,US,"This has acids and tannins and plenty of structure. The winemaker is aiming at an ageworthy, more classic wine. It needs time, or at the very least, serious decanting. But the stuffing is there. Hold until 2010.",,89,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Karl Lawrence

16059,US,"Dense, dry and young, this is a Syrah for the cellar. With 10% Petite Sirah, it has some fierce tannins, and is a little soft, but possesses the inherent balance to age. Give it two or three years, then enjoy the hearty cherry, cassis, leather, cocoa and balsamic flavors for a couple more years.",Fess Parker's Vineyard,89,29.0,California,Santa Barbara,Central Coast,Syrah,JC Cellars
16060,Austria,"The long slope of the Wagram, a relic of the ice age, gives its name to the Terrassen (Terraces) vineyard.

16061,Italy,"Here is a firm, extracted and well-built Aglianico (80%) and Piedirosso blend that benefits from decanting a few hours before being served. Aromas of ruby pomegranate, black cherry and blueberry are backed by territory-driven notes of ash and granite slate. A balanced wine; it should be enjoyed with beef, lamb or cheese-based dishes.",,89,20.0,Southern Italy,Falerno del Massico,,Red Blend,Villa Matilde
16062,US,"This is a perfect melding of fruit, barrel and tannin. The mix of tangy black cherry, wild blackberry, smoke, fig and herbal structure leads into a seductive, lingering finish with cocoa, coffee and spice.",,89,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Waterbrook
16063,Austria,"This is from the premium range produced by the Winzer Krems cooperative. It is a freshly fruity, bramble-flavored wine, lifted with acidity, light flavors of wood and a good, fresh, juicy, spicy aftertaste.",Kellermeister Privat Goldberg,89,,Kremstal,,,Grüner Veltliner,Winzer Krems
16064,US,"Soft, herbal and showing a streak of sweet baking spice, this unusual red wine immediately sets itself apart from more ordinary Bordeaux blends. Slightly more than half Cabernet, a third Cab Franc and 10% Merlot, this definitely has the pedigreed vineyard fruit. The almost supernal softness of the wine suggests some sort of micro-oxidation, yet it remains sappy and tart. Flavors continue through a myriad of baking spices into a rich and extended finish.

16066,US,"High in acidity and bone dry, this light-colored Pinot seems a bit one-dimensional right now, but I think it was released too early. It should gain momentum by the end of 2007, when the cherry, rhubarb and cola flavors become more integrated with the tannins and oak.

16067,US,"This is the fourth vintage for this rare Washington version of Petite Sirah, and the best yet.

16068,Spain,"If you don't mind some heavy barrel char, then you'll probably like this rough rider.

16072,US,"This is very fresh and crisp, mingling light citrus and green apple fruit with interesting herbal enticements of white pepper and tarragon.

16152,Australia,"A soft, easy-drinking sparkling Shiraz, much like Schild's still versions. Toast, vanilla and blackberry aromas and flavors are creamy-textured in the mouth and surprisingly elegant on the finish.",Sparkling,88,24.0,South Australia,Barossa,,Shiraz,Schild Estate
16153,Australia,"This wine delivers plenty of honey and peach notes upfront, then closes with lime and mineral notes from the tiny proportion of Eden Valley Riesling that's been blended in. Crisp and steely.",Evangeliste Reserve,88,30.0,South Australia,Adelaide Hills,,Chardonnay,The Colonial Estate
16154,Austria,"A smooth, creamy single-vineyard wine, with white fruits and delicious balancing acidity. There is some crispness as well as richness, and an edge of spice. Acidity dominates on the finish. Screwcap.",Steinagrund,88,16.0,Wagram-Donauland,,,Grüner Veltliner,Leth
16155,US,"This is a newish producer making Pinot in Marin, the county between San Francisco and Sonoma. The wine is dry, crisp, elegant and medium-bodied, showing cola, cherry liqueur and spicy vanilla flavors. It's a promising Pinot whose next step is to build in additional layers of complexity.",,88,30.0,California,Marin County,North Coast,Pinot Noir,Kendric
16156,US,"This is EOS's Bordeaux blend. The '04 is mainly Cabernet, with a little Petite Sirah, a good move that adds deep plummy flavors and textural tannins to the cherries and blackberries. It's a sophisticated Cab.",French Connection,88,25.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,EOS
16157,Italy,"The excellent 1999 vintage in Piedmont has been somewhat overlooked because it fell between some even better vintages. Erbaluna has crafted an interesting aromatic wine that shows sweet jammy fruit, licorice and violets. It still seems young, and has the structure to benefit from a few more years of bottle age, but it drinks well now.",Organic,88,70.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Erbaluna
16158,US,"Roughly two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one-third Syrah, this soft, dark and fruity wine offers surprisingly deep and luscious flavors of sweet boysenberry and black cherry.

16159,US,"This meaty, substantial wine was barrel fermented in neutral oak and hints at oxidation, particularly in terms of its dusty, tawny color. Clocking in at 14.9% alcohol, it definitely shows some heat on the finish. But it's a full-bodied style with immediate appeal, lush with candied fruit flavors, streaks of butter and toasted nuts. Its weight and mouthfeel are very much like a ripe Chardonnay, but with added perfume and precision.",Velida Estate,88,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Viognier,Gamache
16160,Italy,"The wine has evolved quickly, and the color is showing some browning on the edge. Almost fully mature now, it shows aromas of marzipan, strawberries and roses. Complex and pretty, the wine has a solid midpalate, and the finish is shorter than I would have expected. Still a nice, well-made wine for lovers of older Nebbiolos.",Bricco S. Giacomo,88,29.0,Piedmont,Nebbiolo d'Alba,,Nebbiolo,Giacomo Ascheri
16161,Italy,"In a year where so many Barbarescos are heavy and slightly plummy, this is lighter and the fruit aromas are more primary. On the palate the flavors show elements of wild strawberries, lavender and smoke, and the wine is balanced and finishes well. A really pleasant Barbaresco that will evolve for a few more years.",,88,36.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Giribaldi
16162,Italy,"The Damilano is a modern take on Barbera; a big, very ripe, chunky wine that is easy to like. The fruit is thick with dark jammy flavors, and although there are hints of something more exotic lurking, at the moment all you have is a hint of spice. Easy to drink now, but worth cellaring for a couple of years, as it will prove to be more interesting with some bottle age.",,88,18.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Damilano

16165,France,"An elegant, full-bodied wine, showing the richness of 2005, but keeping the tropical fruit element in balance with the light toast and butter flavors.

16166,US,"This is Paraiso's most expensive Pinot, a block selection from their estate vineyard in the southern part of the Highlands. The wine is very good, although for some reason not quite up there with the 2001 or 2003. The fruity ripeness shows in the forward cherry, raspberry and cola-root beer flavors, and and wine is fully dry. Drink now.",West Terrace,88,40.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Paraiso Vineyards
16167,US,"Although it's a very good wine, this is just a little too ripe. The blackberry and cherry flavors are almost raisined, especially on the finish, due to the extreme heat of the vintage. Duckhorn managed it better than many, but despite an official alcohol of just 14.5%, the wine has a burnt jam taste. Drink now.",,87,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Duckhorn
16168,US,"The Gamache brothers call this blend, which is half Cabernet Franc, one quarter Merlot, and the rest split between Malbec and Syrah, a happy accident—the result of having a shortage of Cabernet Sauvignon for blending. The Franc is a great base wine, a little rough and green, but packed with firm, cool-site red grape flavors. Aromatic and tasting of mixed fruits, it's blended just ahead of bottling, so the juice gets the same care as the pricier varietal wines.",Boulder,87,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Gamache

16177,US,"This interesting Cabernet combines brambly berry fruit with a streak of maple syrup.

Flavors are nicely integrated and work well together on the lasting finish.",,88,28.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Two Mountain
16178,US,"Enormously jammy in raspberries and cherries, this is almost sweet, like spicy dessert-pastry filling.

16205,US,"Once again, the Burgundian touch of Veronique Drouhin has crafted a wine of surpassing elegance and immaculate structure. This is the antithesis of a jammy, California style yet it retains much of the vibrancy of New World fruit rather than the suppressed rusticity of Burgundy.

16206,US,"Made in an exceptionally ripe and strongly oaky way, this wine is rather heavy right now. The Cabernet was blended with some Syrah and Petit Verdot grown in a Calistoga vineyard.

16210,US,"California Syrah doesn't get much richer than this. It explodes in blackberry and cherry jam, olive tapenade, dark chocolate and bacon flavors, wrapped into firm, intricate tannins.

16211,US,"This Cabernet-based blend of all five Bordeaux varieties is the most inaccessible of Merryvale's '07 portfolio, and it consequently offers the least pleasure now. It's quite rich in blackberries and currants but the tannins are considerable, and 90% new oak buries the fruit under a cloak of char and wood tannins.

16218,US,"This estate-bottled Pinot Gris, from a vineyard planted in 1983, shows some definite residual sugar, despite its alcohol rating of 14.4%. Plenty ripe all right, and plenty tasty, too.

In fact, there's a lingering perfume reminiscent of paints in an artist's studio. The wine is elegant in the mouth with crisp acidity and a long finish.",,88,16.0,Southern Italy,Aglianico del Vulture,,Aglianico,Vigne di Mezzo
16236,Italy,"Vibrant fruit, red apple and blue flowers appear with intensity on the nose to create a racy, clean red wine. The acidity is good, as is the structure, but the 15% alcohol does hit the palate hard. Pair it with cream-based pasta (to counter the alcohol), white meat and roasted winter vegetables.",Schiaccianoci Riserva,88,18.0,Southern Italy,Salento,,Negroamaro,Vigne & Vini
16237,US,"Primitivo makes up three-fifths of the blend, Petite Sirah most of the rest. It's consistent with past vintages: dark, soft, and plummy. But in 2005 there was something special going on, and the decadently sweet black cherry fruit really sings here.",Dr. Wolfe's Family Red,88,15.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Red Blend,Thurston Wolfe
16238,US,"Really young now, this vineyard block bottling needs a little time to come into its own. Tasted in February, a combination of acidity and bottle shock has made it brittle. But it's a very good wine, deliciously flavored, with a medium-bodied silkiness and Pinot's exotic sensuality.",Lot 4 Selection,88,38.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Moshin
16239,Italy,"Crisp, fruity and full of mineral nuances, this faithfully represents Sardinia's winemaking potential, especially when it comes to easy-drinking white wines. Vanilla, stone fruit, apple-nut, citrus peel and honey flavors boost a creamy, almost viscous consistency.",Cala Silente,88,16.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Vermentino di Sardegna,,Vermentino,Cantina Santadi
16240,US,"Ripe, with tons of juicy cherry, blackberry, mocha and woody spice flavors, but fully dry. There's good acids and tannins, so it's all balanced and harmonious. It's not an ager, but is lovely and fairly complex.",,88,35.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Fritz

16242,US,"This is a deep gold, scented with cooked apple and pear, and showing some soft, oxidative character from extended barrel fermentation. It is quite accessible, soft and forward, with light hints of tropical fruits leading into a smooth, lightly toasty finish. Definitely a drink-now Chardonnay.",,88,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Dusted Valley
16243,US,"This is an excellent vintage in Washington, and Bob Bertheau has made a soft, smooth, well-crafted Sauvignon Blanc. Just a bit more than one-third was barrel fermented, and the blend is 100% varietal. It's a fruity, polished effort with citrusy highlights, but I'd love to see the winemaker veer a bit more towards a Washington State-style that includes some sweet grassiness in the finish.",Horse Heaven Vineyard,88,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Chateau Ste.

16245,US,"Lots of acidity in this crunchy wine; this is so tart it's almost like fresh-squeezed lime juice. Fortunately, creamy lees and plenty of new oak add softer, sweeter notes of buttered toast and vanilla.",Chamisal Vineyards,88,24.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Domaine Alfred
16246,Spain,"Plenty of intense new oak sets the nose in a direction toward mint, licorice and black pepper. And that's all good, because the palate backs it up  with prime blackberry and cassis flavors. This is a solid wine with slightly pronounced acids and tannins. Not for those averse to a little grab and kick.",Prios Maximus Crianza,88,26.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Bodegas de los Rios Prieto

16248,US,"For my money, this is the most authentic wine that Maryhill makes. It has not been softened, oaked, sweetened and vanilla'd up—it just shows the great fruit and the verticality of nicely ripened grapes. Composed of 40% Merlot, 32% Cabernet, 22% Syrah, 6% Cab Franc and 13.9% alcohol.",Winemaker's Blend,88,10.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Maryhill
16249,Italy,"A sophisticated and seductive expression of the Primitivo grape, this Antinori-made Puglian wine boasts thick concentration, fruity extracts, ripe cherry flavors, strawberry and a thick inky appearance.

16250,Australia,"Fits the Chardonnay image to a T, with descriptors like smoke, clove, cinnamon, apple and citrus all coming readily to mind.

16251,Spain,"Nicely balanced and a better example of the upside of Navarra than the wines that are based on or include Merlot. The nose shows some herbal character but more deep fruit notes. And in the mouth there's ripe cherry, cassis and plum. Texturally, it's very nice, and when you get down to the nuts and olts it's a very good value.",,88,11.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo,Vega Sindoa
16252,US,"This wine fits the winery style like a comfy old shoe. It feels good, smells good and wears well.

16253,Austria,"From the first vintage of Grüner Veltliner wines under the Weinviertel DAC, this offering from Hans Setzer is crisp, fresh and light, showing a little softness from age, but still full of vibrant white currants and pepper.",Ried Eichholz,88,,Weinviertel,,,Grüner Veltliner,Setzer
16254,US,"In 2003 the vineyard was going through some changes, and the vintage, the shift in focus and the winemaker's predilection for early picking seemed to conspire to produce a rather thin, austere wine. It's locked up tight, a bit herbal and lean, not yet revealing itself even with aeration. It's one of those mystery wines that you keep coming back to, waiting for the light to blink on.",Klipsun Vineyard,88,30.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Seven Hills
16255,France,"Ripe but minerally, all flint and crisp fruit along with the richness from the structure and green plum and wood flavors.

16257,Spain,"Carchelo is at its best in this vintage. This is loaded with wild blackberry and leathery sass, too.

A true hot-climate country wine but one with polish and pizzazz.",Carchelo,88,11.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Monastrell,Bodegas Agapito Rico
16258,Italy,"There's a saturated, almost amber-like tinge to this oak-driven Sardinia Vermentino and Chardonnay blend.

16259,Argentina,"The bouquet is fairly tight, with aromas of coffee, crushed minerals, crude oil and fine herbs. The palate runs snappier than most high-end Malbecs, but it also delivers on the promise of ripeness and black-fruit flavors. Finishes in healthy fashion, with some slickness and speed.

16266,Germany,"Sweet and lightweight, with typical floral, green apple and peach aromas and flavors. Lime flavors kick in on the finish, which seem a bit insubstantial and lacking depth.

16295,Italy,"The Vigna Ròca Neira is no shrinking violet. It weighs in at 14.5% alcohol, and is a massive wine with blackberry liqueur aromas, big plummy superripe flavors and a dense finish.

16298,Italy,"This is one of the more exotic Barberas. The dark fruit is mixed with scents of licorice, curry and violets.

16299,US,"A little sugar goes a long way. This dessert wine is primarily Ain, with a splash of Muscat and Viognier. It's quite sweet, with apricot, tangerine, peach, honey and dusty spice flavors. This would be a great wine if the flavors were more concentrated.",Amador Ice,87,35.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,White Blend,Renwood
16300,Italy,"This wine needed time in the glass to really show its stuff. At first, a touch volatile and funky, this soon blew off, and the wine showed plenty of sweet fruit, rose petal and licorice.

16305,US,"Here's an interesting blend: 71% Zinfandel, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon and the rest a split between Merlot and Cab Franc —all of it Walla Walla Valley fruit. It jumps out with a spicy hit of barrel, a little rough but quickly smothered in cherry-flavored fruit and chocolaty tannins.

16308,Austria,"It is odd to find a Pinot Blanc in the land of Grüner Veltliner and Riesling. But a block of loam soil, planted with old vines gave Erich Machherndl the idea for this wine.

16329,US,"Lots of rich, ripe varietal flavor in this dry, tannic young Cabernet. It's strong in blackberries and cassis, with a cedary edge that has the scent of a cigar box.

16330,US,"This is a smooth customer, with a rich, silky mouthfeel, and has the soft seductive velvety character that allows it to feel complete as a standalone clone.

16365,US,"This new Bordeaux-style red could technically be labeled Cabernet Sauvignon, as it accounts for 82% of the blend.

16380,US,"BFM stands for Blow Your Freakin' Mind, say the winemakers, whose marketing spin is to aggressively position their wines as ready to party. Nonetheless this four grape Bordeaux blend is priced to compete with serious and substantial wines from around the world, and in terms of flavor it does so competently.

16381,US,"Chardonnay is the sweet spot in the white wine lineup (along with Riesling, of course).

16382,US,"Shows the robust mouthfeel and high alcohol that Lodi Zins usually bring, with a concentration of Zinny essence that must be due to low yielding vines.

16386,US,"For the first time this popular blend contains no Yakima Valley fruit. The savvy blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah works like a charm. Outside of the Ste.

Big, fruity and forward.",,88,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Riesling,Seven Hills
16389,US,"Scents of smoke, earth, citrus rind and a strong acidic foundation define this wine. It's a fine example of cooler-site Washington Syrah, with all the nuances that that brings to the wine.

16393,US,"Cheval and Champoux. Snappy and crisply defined, this sharp-edged wine opens with tight berry flavors, some chalky acids, and grainy, stony tannins.

16395,Argentina,"Here's a nice wine that pushes the right buttons while not raising any red flags.

16397,US,"This is a clear step up from the excellent Two Vines Shiraz, and worth the extra couple of bucks. Wild berry flavors and varietal spice are given a somewhat tannic, earthy frame.

16401,Australia,"This full-bodied wine could use a touch more lushness in the midpalate to help carry its assertive flavors of blackberries and chocolate.

16498,Germany,"Mid-gold in color, featuring broad, layered aromas of ripe yellow stone fruit, ruby red grapefruit and mineral notes. Concentrated flavors prevail across the palate showing crisp citrus fruits, nectarines, white peaches and hints of honey.

16499,US,"There's so much oak on this Pinot Noir, you might think you were tasting a dessert made with vanilla cream and toasted meringue, like the crust on a baked Alaska. Under all that, loads of ripe raspberries and cherries. Shows the excellent hallmarks of a fine Santa Rita Pinot Noir, but certainly is one of the oakier versions.",,90,95.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Coup de Foudre
16500,Italy,"This cool-climate expression shows exceptionally-beautiful tones of peach, melon and pear. A tiny percentage of the wine is aged in French barrel.

16501,Spain,"Blackberry, tobacco and balsamic aromas lean slightly towards vinegar, and there's a distinct tangy quality to the palate.

Will do best with food.",Hombros,88,37.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Casar de Burbia

16504,France,"The blend in this cuvée is 70% Grenache and 30% Syrah, aged in second-use oak. The oak provides hints of baking spices on the nose and some cedary notes on the palate, nicely accenting the bright black-cherry fruit in this medium-bodied wine.

16519,US,"Light and tight fruit flavors of pretty berry open slowly after plenty of breathing time. The wine is nicely structured, balanced with the addition of 12% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Malbec—the only drawback is the almost complete lack of aroma.

16520,Spain,"For a 60,000-case Toro, this is very good and well recommended. It smells full, leathery and slightly cheesy, with baked berry aromas.

16524,France,"Despite this wine's evident ripeness, it remains freshly floral and perfumed on the nose.

16525,US,"Enormously rich and sweet in jammy blackberries and cherries, sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon spice, this wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot.

16530,Spain,"Generally speaking, this is a respectable Priorat from a tough year. The nose is berry packed, while the flavors run toward toast-covered raspberry.

16533,US,"Ripe and fruity, loaded with soft, plush, blackberry/black cherry fruit. This is a sweet, soft, open and forward style—a rather dramatic shift in style that was sparked, no doubt, by newly-installed, California-trained winemaker Bob Bertheau, who guided this vintage from the start. Though delicious and ripe, it could stand to be tightened up a bit.",Canoe Ridge Estate,88,24.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau Ste. Michelle
16534,US,"Soft and creamy, this is consistent with the previous vintage and sets the stage for the winery's bigger, oakier single-vineyard Chardonnays. Mixed stone fruits, pineapple and an elegant, full-bodied mouthfeel make this particularly appealing for the price. It uses the oak judiciously, and avoids the overdone vanilla flavors that many inexpensive New World Chardonnays rely on.",,88,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Chateau Ste.

16538,US,"Notable for its dryness and minerally tang, this is a tight, young Chardonnay right now. The flavors veer toward grapefruits, with notes of passionfruit and honeysuckle.

Drink now.",,88,22.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Syrah,Tassajara
16540,Italy,"This is not the inky-viscous powerhouse you'd expect from this sun-drenched territory.

Finishes dry and complex.",,88,25.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Orogeny
16543,Argentina,"Robust and with a touch of raisin, this full-bodied Cab hits many correct notes.

16544,US,"Classic Lodi Cab, from a vintage that wasn't too hot or too cool. The wine is soft and lush, with milk chocolate and cassis flavors and the vanillins and sweet char of oak.

16546,Argentina,"Overt oak is the first thing you encounter on the nose, but underneath the heavy wood covering is a polished and sincere wine. The mouth is lively and juicy, with commendable plum and raspberry flavors. And while the finish is sort of basic in its vanilla and chocolate character, it has a nice feel to it.

16548,France,"Toasty, with notes of slightly menthol-like oak layered over ripe blackberry fruit. It's a medium-bodied wine that finishes crisp, tart and mouthwatering.

16550,US,"The sources of this Syrah are all very good, including top vineyards from Santa Barbara, Arroyo Seco, Alexander Valley and Lake County.

16552,France,"Produced from a Brotte-owned property, this Châteauneuf is a deliberate counterpoint to the Père Anselme bottling.

16553,US,"From the Maury Balcom vineyard, this is a dry, fruit-forward rosé, finished at a pleasing 12.4% alcohol.

16555,Argentina,"Full and inviting up front, with hickory and leather in addition to dark-fruit aromas. This is a collaboration between two Italian buddies and the wine features black cherry and plum flavors but also rather grabby, heavy tannins.

16589,Germany,This bargain-priced white is a blend of two-thirds Riesling and one-third Pinot Blanc. The result is a somewhat simple but clean and tasty wine that mixes apple and pear with citrus. Feels biggish in the mouth but without a lot of depth. Good party option. Imported by Billington Imports.,Big Tattoo White QbA,84,9.0,Nahe,,,White Blend,2 Brothers
16590,US,"Nearly all Pinot Noir, with just 15% Chardonnay, this full-bodied sparkler has raspberry and cherry liqueur flavors that finish with a dose of sweet honey. Very high acidity brings needed balance to this rich wine, but it does seem like it could finish a little drier.",Blanc de Noirs,87,37.0,California,Napa-Mendocino-Sonoma,North Coast,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg
16591,US,"This is Schramsberg's sweet sparkler, although it's not terribly sweet; it only suggests a touch of honeyed caramel cream, peach-vanilla frappuccino and gingerbread. Crisp acidity helps to balance. Made mainly from the rare Flora grape, which is a cross between Sémillon and Gewürztraminer.",Crémant Demi-sec,87,38.0,California,Napa-Mendocino-Sonoma,North Coast,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg
16592,US,"A little sharp, but easily the winery's best non-vineyard designated Cab since the '02. Shows a ripeness level that slam dunks cherries, blackberries, cola and oak onto the palate, yet maintains an elegant dryness.",,87,18.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rutherford Ranch
16593,US,"A solid brut from Mumm Napa, this Pinot-Chardonnay blend is a little rough around the edges, but has the dry, bubbly finesse of a true Champagne-style wine. It shows peach, lime and strawberry flavors.",Brut Prestige,87,19.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Sparkling Blend,Mumm Napa
16594,Austria,"Very Muscat, very aromatic, this is a light, crowd-pleasing apéritif wine that dances on the palate. It's dry, but the lychee-like perfumed flavor and the spice make it softer and easier. Glass stopper.",,87,13.0,Burgenland,,,Muskat Ottonel,Zantho
16595,Italy,"The Ceretto was surprisingly evolved for a 2006. A big, ripe, rich wine with flavors of pear, lychee and a hint of lime peel. Structurally, this is a wine that probably won't hold up well, but at the moment it is a pleasant wine. Just make sure you drink it over the next few months.",Blange,86,17.0,Piedmont,Langhe,,Arneis,Ceretto
16596,Italy,"A muted nose but a pleasant combination of sweet dark fruit, violets and earth. The wine shows more concentration on the palate, but the finish is quite short. Pleasant and commercial.",Liste,86,63.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Damilano
16597,Italy,"It takes a few minutes to get the best out of this wine. By then the initial cheesiness has worn off, and aromas of mineral, stones and fruit come to the fore. On the palate, the wine shows some good complexity although a short to medium finish.",La Luciana,86,11.0,Piedmont,Gavi,,Cortese,Araldica
16598,Italy,"The Ascheri is a light-colored wine with a lovely nose of honeysuckle, pear and lychees. On the palate, the fruit flavors were less intense but it showed good balance and a medium finish. An attractive wine which probably should be drunk fairly soon.",Cristina Ascheri,86,22.0,Piedmont,Langhe,,Arneis,Giacomo Ascheri
16599,Italy,"The wine begins well with aromas of dark fruit and spice, but the palate is less exciting; the burst of fruit gives way to a hollow midpalate, although it does come back to a solid if dull finish.",Rié,86,17.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba Superiore,,Barbera,Giribaldi
16600,US,"This bubbly is rich in cherry and raspberry fruit, in addition to the usual sparkling wine notes of bread dough and smoke. It's a little sweet and scoury on the palate, but a fairly polished sparkler for this price.",Sonoma Brut,86,20.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Gloria Ferrer
16601,Italy,"The Bongiovanni is a modernist take on Barbera; it is a big, ripe wine, spiced with oak. With some time in the glass, it showed complexity, with flavors of violets and smokiness but the fruit still dominated. There was a slight hollowness two thirds in, but the wine came back and finished with some aplomb.",,86,33.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,,Barbera,Cascina Bongiovanni
16602,US,"The Wallula vineyard, set high atop a bluff overlooking the Columbia river, gives grapes that bring dark, roasted flavors to the large-scale wine. The fruit tastes as if it has been pushed, perhaps a bit too far, and the impression it leaves tilts toward the raisiny side. It's a wine that could go in a positive direction with cellar time, but it is impossible to tell right now, as it cuts off quickly once in the mouth.",Wallula Vineyard,86,22.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Lost River

16604,US,"Côtes de Tablas is Tablas Creek's number two white, after their Esprit de Beaucastel. The '06 is a blend of Viognier, Marsanne, Grenache Blanc and Roussanne.

16605,Italy,"The basic Barbaresco is a pleasant, light, complex wine, with flavors of bright strawberry fruit, road tar and minerals.

16606,US,"Off a beat from the great '03, closer to the '02, this is an elegant young sparkler, lacking a bit in finesse. This 100% Chardonnay has slightly sweet flavors of lemon candy and yeast.",Blanc de Blancs,86,35.0,California,Napa-Mendocino-Sonoma-Marin,North Coast,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg
16607,US,"Eaglepoint red wines are big and powerful, seldom less than fully ripe and usually with a good boost of alcohol. So it is with this hearty, tannic Zin.

16608,New Zealand,"Sturdy and chunky, with pleasant notes of black cherries and plums set off by cola and coffee.

16609,US,"A blend of Minnick and Ash Hollow grapes, this is a punchy, high-toned take on Syrah. Particularly attractive are the bright raspberry flavors, peppered with, well, pepper!

16610,US,"Trinity county is just north of Mendocino, with a hot, inland climate. This wine advances the fine wine cause up there.

16612,Austria,"A blend of Welschriesling and Scheurebe, this is a fresh and delicate wine that wears its sweetness easily. Some botrytis, some honey, but the acidity comes into play as does the pineapple flavor. Glass stopper.",Beerenauslese,86,19.0,Burgenland,,,White Blend,Zantho
16613,US,"Kestrel remains one of the most enigmatic Washington wineries; brilliant at times, disappointing at others, possessed of excellent old-vine fruit and yet plagued with inconsistency. This Co-ferment Syrah was excellent in 2002 and even better in 2003, but falls a bit short in 2004. It's got the purple-black color but not the density to match; the fruit flavors are chewy and tart, and the wine has an acidic edge that leaves an impression of unripeness.",Winemaker's Select Co-ferment Estate,86,38.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Syrah,Kestrel
16614,Argentina,"Getting past the giant blast of oak that dominates the bouquet is not an easy task, but the intrepid wood chopper will find another side to this wine, one that's full of bright, juicy black fruit and syrupy core sweetness. Of course, the oak is always present and with that comes mocha, coffee and vanilla notes. Imported by Gascon USA.",Gascón,86,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Don Miguel Gascón
16615,Argentina,"This wine seems mulchy and warm; it comes out of the bottle with attitude and some fire. As it settles, you get berry, bramble and leather, and always does it seem a little “traditional” in style rather than modern and polished up. Definitely a full-bodied, oily wine that could use more flavor and fruit.",Reserva Finca Castro Barros,86,25.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Enrique Foster
16616,New Zealand,"Barrel-fermented Pinot Gris is a bit of a rarity, but this one is good if you like the style. Buttered apples and nuts lead the way, backed by tangerine fruit and outlined by oaky spice. Tough to know whether aging it will result in slightly better integration, or if you're better off drinking this one young.",,86,30.0,Martinborough,,,Pinot Gris,Escarpment
16617,US,"This single-vineyard wine from Foxen's estate is a little too sweet. It seems to contain residual sugar, to judge by the jellied pineapple and apricot flavors.

16619,US,"In 2004 new winemaker William Ammons began at Glen Fiona, and this is the first of his wines to be released. This is spicy with pepper and herb, both in the nose and in the mouth. The fruit is quite tart and tastes of rhubarb and cranberry.",Basket Press Reserve,86,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Glen Fiona
16620,US,"For a wine that's been made with a soft touch but still has some weight and finesse, this is a great value.

16621,US,"This single-vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon captures the flavor profile of Pepper Bridge fruit, with streaks of green olive and green tea adding complexity to the tart and brambly fruits.

16625,US,"Will appeal broadly to many Pinot lovers for its soft, lush array of flavor. Raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice and bacon all lead to a long, spicy finish. Trades complexity for immediate appeal, so drink up.",Garys' Vineyard,88,50.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Lucia
16626,Austria,"Icewine from Cabernet Sauvignon is pretty rare. The grape's dark pigment lends the wine no more than a hint of pink in the gold color.

16650,US,"Very big and rich and extracted, offering massive flavors of cherries and raspberries, enriched with caramelized oak. Very delicious, if a little obvious.

16652,Argentina,"Here's a Bordeaux-style blend to snap up if you're lucky enough to find it. It's a definite re-issue in that it was first released at $25 in 2006 but was put back on the market last year at $15.

A mature, classy wine to drink now.",Serie Magno Gran Reserva,90,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Fantelli

16659,US,"A real success in a challenging vintage, this is a meaty, flavorful, well-built Pinot Noir. The fruit is a mix of berries, especially strawberry, with accents of peach, cola, earth, sassafras and cinnamon. The wine keeps on going; it doesn't wimp out or turn bitter. It's interesting now, but should develop even more flavor with some years of cellaring.",SV Estate,90,40.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Stoller

16665,US,"This deceptive wine looks almost Pinot-like in color, but packs a myriad of flavors into its compact and raw frame. Rose petals, pomegranate, sour cherry, hints of cumin and nutmeg—it just keeps on going. Tannins are beautifully polished and the wine slowly unfolds, adding layers of flavor.

16674,US,"This is a pretty nice wine. It's made in a lighter style than from warmer regions, and is silky, absolutely dry and crisp in acids.

Drink this elegantly constructed, food-friendly wine now.",Bien Nacido Vineyard,90,36.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Merlot,Folkway
16675,US,"A beautiful, young and firmly tannic Pinot Noir that should improve in the bottle. It's fully dry and fine in acidity, with expressive flavors of black and red cherries, cola, beef jerky, crushed pepper and sweet, smoky sandalwood. Very nice now with a good steak, and ought to show development over the next 5–7 years.",Alfaro Family Vineyard,90,42.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Big Basin
16676,Italy,"This is a very special wine from central Italy made with Pecorino grapes (a variety that is currently experiencing and happy revival). The wine opens with a golden-amber color and offers spicy aromas of pastry cream, vanilla, spice, exotic fruit, honey and apricot. It's a big, structured white wine to pair with pork or veal.",,90,24.0,Central Italy,Colline Pescaresi,,Pecorino,Ciavolich Giuseppe
16677,US,"This is a blend of grapes from Calistoga to Carneros. The wine shows Cabernet's full-bodied character and rather fierce tannins, although it has an enormous soul of blackberries, black currants and dark chocolate, as well as plenty of new oak. Shuttered and hard now, it should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",,90,43.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clos Pegase
16678,US,"This excellent grower/producer has crafted a ripe, muscular Pinot Noir with the accent on spicy cranberry, plum and cherry compote.

16679,US,"A beautiful, succulent young Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend that delivers plenty of flavor. It's front-loaded with blackberries, cherries, currants and chocolate.

16680,US,"Softly gentle, this wine is easy to like for its wealth of pie filling blackberries, cherries, blueberries and milk chocolate.

Contains one-quarter Grenache, with a drop of Zin.",Rousse Rouge,87,20.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Syrah,Tassajara
16681,Argentina,"Santa Julia doesn't try to trick you with its wines. They are what they are, and for under  10 this creamy, berry-packed wine should please the masses.

16684,US,"Plummy and ripe, this tannic, herbal take on Zinfandel is ready for near-term drinking.

The alcohol is a moderate 14.5%.",Howling Wolfe,87,18.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Zinfandel,Thurston Wolfe
16685,US,"A controversial wine. On the plus side are dryness and silky elegance, courtesy of finely ground tannins and crisp acidity, while the cherry and earthy tobacco and truffle flavors are restrained and complex.

16688,US,"Nice and smooth, this Cab hits the palate with a plush tannic structure and oak-infused cassis and red cherry flavors.

In the mouth, this wine offers sweet berry flavors, spice and dusty tannins.",Cantalupi,87,11.0,Southern Italy,Salento,,Primitivo,Conti Zecca
16690,US,"Here is another gem from the Two Vines lineup. Clean, fresh-tasting, varietal flavors show grapefruit and melon front and center.

16693,US,"This wine is sourced from Lafayette, a bedroom community of San Francisco, and you know what? It's pretty good.

I'm looking forward to tasting the '05.",Ward Vineyard,87,20.0,California,Contra Costa County,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Tassajara
16694,Italy,"Thanks to a thick, purple-hued appearance you know you're in for a ripe and concentrated wine with thick layers of sweet red fruit aromas. The fruit is in fact very forthcoming but is also rendered more complex by background notes of graphite and chestnut. It's a youthful wine with a bright future.",Tenuta Rocca dei Leoni,87,20.0,Southern Italy,Aglianico del Beneventano,,Aglianico,Villa Matilde
16695,Italy,"This is a simpatico wine with perky notes of candied cherry, sweet spice, spring flowers, cocoa and vanilla. In fact, it smells a lot like chocolate cake. In the mouth it is smooth and velvety with a medium-long finish.",,87,18.0,Southern Italy,Primitivo di Manduria,,Primitivo,Ognissole
16696,US,"Shows rich, racy acidity in a dry wine whose flavors veer toward ripe pineapple-tart filling, cinnamon spice and butterscotch, wrapped in a creamy texture. Would score far higher if the fruit were more concentrated.",,87,20.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Schug
16697,US,"The best of Schug's three current Pinots, a blend of several vineyards throughout the appellation.

Drink this polished wine now.",,87,24.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Schug
16698,Australia,"Although a very good wine, this is a bit disappointing coming from winemaker Ben Glaetzer.

Finishes fresh, with tart berry flavors.",Jester,87,20.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Mitolo
16699,Spain,"A little weighty, with ripe apple and peach aromas. Fairly succulent in the mouth, with apple and citrus flavors that are both sweet and a touch chewy.

16700,Italy,"You'll pick up an attractive smoked ham-like quality on the nose backed by blueberry, blackberry, lead pencil, crushed black pepper and licorice.

16706,US,"Though perhaps just a notch below the 2002 version, this remains the Merlot to beat in the budget bottle sweepstakes.

16708,Spain,"Heat from the 2003 vintage aside, this is one sweet, forward, dark-colored Cava.

16768,US,"This is solidly made, with rough, chewy tannins and hard fruit flavors that show concentrated plum and cassis. Everything is in good proportion, although the acids are a bit chalky and the high alcohol (just under 15%) takes it away from classic Bordeaux flavors. It would be nice to see the ripeness ramped down a notch, because the mix of grapes is right and there's good fruit here. It just has been ripened to the point where the alcohol takes over.",,86,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Meritage,DiStefano
16769,Argentina,"Graffigna has shown improvement with its current set of releases. This Cab starts out dark, charred and full of blackberry aromas and flavors. It initially seems flashy and ready for anything. But the more you run it across your palate, the more the acidity rises up. And before long it almost seems scouring and jumpy. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Grand Reserve,86,20.0,Other,San Juan,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Graffigna

16774,US,"A Bordeaux blend with all the usual suspects (except Malbec), Six Sigma's Cuvee has a huge Cabernet Sauvignon nose, all dark berry and plum with a hint of lavender.

16775,Australia,"This is a restrained, even delicate, Pinot Noir, with nuanced aromas of underbrush and barely ripe cherries.

16781,US,"This is Lafond's entry-level Pinot, and it's arguably the best SRH in years. The vintage was kind, offering long hangtime fruit, while preserving vital acidity.

16786,US,"Feels chunky and gritty in the mouth, with fresh young tannins giving a hard bite. Down under all that are flavors of ripe blackberry jam and spice.

16801,US,"Young and spicy, with deeply-etched cranberry fruit flavors, limned with leafy herbal tannins. The core of fruit is pretty as can be, and the nicely-managed tannins wrap it in a perfect frame, while giving it added muscle. Another two or three years in the bottle will really bring this into focus.",JV Estate,90,25.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Stoller
16802,US,"Great entry, soft and seductive, with cherry and chocolate, but it dies quickly, fading into a delicate malted milk flavor. Re-tasted after being open for several hours, it had gained a little flesh, retained the milk chocolate flavors, but still seemed to need more bottle age to soften up the finish.",Estate Cuvée,90,50.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Sokol Blosser
16803,US,"The Goosepen bottling is distinctive, elegant and spicy, with a mix of baking spices, soft fruits, chocolate, coconut and butter.

16809,US,"Like the winery's “Fuller” Pinot Noir, this special, limited-edition offering honors some Oregon wine industry stalwarts, the owners of Elton Vineyards. It clearly reflects the flavors of the Eola-Amity Hills AVA—no tricks or attempts to hide the natural earthy, herbal character. Herb and sassafras, pine needle and sour cherry, spice and even a hint of pickle barrel (American oak?) mingle pleasantly, and the alcohol remains at a comfortable 13.3%.",O'Brien,90,100.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley Vineyards
16810,Germany,"Mid-gold color. Pronounced aromas of ripe yellow fruits, honey, with hints of warm earth, savory fresh root vegetables and spice. Sweet, richly textured, but refreshingly crisp.

16813,Italy,"This is a particularly well-balanced edition of Benuara (a 70-30 blend of Nero d'Avola and Syrah) that boasts a very nice quality and integrity of fruit followed by fresh aromas of blackberry, cherry and a shading of exotic spice. The low price will also win you over.",Benuara,89,16.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Red Blend,Cusumano

16815,Argentina,"Dark and heavily oaked on first blush, but give it time to unwind or let it sit in the bottle for a year or two and this will satisfy any Malbec lover. Early on, it's dense and full of shoe polish, mint and coconut; later it spreads out to show sweet dark-berry flavors and finally a rich, almost sticky finish of woodspice, brown sugar and lushness.",Reserva,89,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Domaine Jean Bousquet

16818,US,"A lovely dessert wine in almost every respect. It's crisp in acidity and has complex, somewhat oxidized or Madeira-like flavors of oranges, tapioca and vanilla. Could be a little more focused and intense, but very fine, although it calls for a certain appreciation of this oxidative quality.",Ancient Vine Angelica,89,130.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Debit,Gypsy Canyon
16819,US,"Beautiful, classic blackberry and currant fruit in this polished Cabernet, along with a rich, tasteful coat of sweet oak. The tannins are thick but refined. The grapes come from this plateau between Napa and Sonoma counties.

16820,Germany,"Pale gold color wine, with attractive floral nose hints, honey, slate and some obvious sulfur. Racy with a crisp juicy texture, lemony and moderately taut.

Reasonably long length.",Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Spätlese,89,20.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Joh. Haart
16821,US,"Searing acidity marks this wine, which tastes like it has a lot of Edna Valley fruit in the blend. It also shows bright, strong, long hangtime flavors of limes and pineapples. It's actually quite a fine Chardonnay, dry and low in alcohol. A great value at this price.",,89,15.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Bishop's Peak
16822,US,"Marked by dryness and some heat from alcohol, this wine also has a rich core of ripe cherries. It's very strong and powerful, not a Zinfandel that's shy or apologizes for its brashness. But that's the essence of Rockpile. Drink this sturdy wine now, and the ideal food pairing is barbecue.",Rocky Reserve Florence Vineyard,89,33.0,California,Rockpile,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Carol Shelton
16823,US,"This is a very rich Chardonnay, almost too elaborated and overworked. It's tremendous in oak-infused fruit, with dominating buttered toast, crème brûlée and pineapple pie flavors. Very crisp coastal acidity provides a pleasant balance of tartness. Drink now.",Bien Nacido Vineyard,89,40.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,La Fenêtre

16828,Germany,"Pale gold color. Broad and aromatic, showing ripe yellow peach and nectarine, hints of honey, dried herbs and an earthy minerality.

16829,Germany,"Slightly closed at first, but slowly opens to reveal ripe stone fruits, hints of white flowers and an earthy minerality.

Moderately long, juicy finish.",Trocken,89,25.0,Rheinhessen,,,Riesling,Wittmann
16830,Spain,"Nothing wrong with this pleasant, friendly Cava. The nose boasts frosted breakfast cereal and lemon curd, while the palate is defined by spiced apple and baked citrus. It gets more honeyed and fat as it opens, although a good chilling will keep that in check.",Masia Parera Brut,87,11.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Sparkling Blend,Giró Ribot
16831,Spain,"Nice and fruity, with a touch of spice to the nose. The palate is plump and dark, with nothing besides all-natural fruit. A hearty and healthy wine that boasts freshness and purity but no oak.",,87,12.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Gotin
16832,Austria,"This cross between Traminer and Roter Veltliner is found mainly in the Thermenregion in Austria. This example is rich and perfumed, with some hint of lychees but low acidity. Wood aging does little for it. Screwcap.",Reserve,87,,Thermenregion,,,Rotgipfler,Johanneshof Reinisch

16836,Argentina,"Sauvignon Blanc is far from being Argentina's signature grape, so the fact that this one from San Juan province is legitimate, crisp and varietally correct is impressive. Beyond that, the wine delivers true lime, passion fruit and citrus aromas and flavors. Fresh and easy to like.",,87,9.0,Other,San Juan,,Sauvignon Blanc,Las Moras
16837,US,"A mix of fruit that survived the big freeze, from Dwelley, Morrison Lane and Minnick vineyards. It's tight, tart and tannic, and showing some pickle barrel notes from time in new American oak. Herbal and compact, this is a wine that should probably be given another year or so in the bottle to smooth itself out.",,87,25.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Seven Hills
16838,Germany,"Fragrant and slightly floral or herbal, but there's also an intriguing mineral-smoke note that adds dimension to the aromas. It's light to medium-bodied, with apple, mint and lime flavors complementing a dry, stony minerality. Drink now.",P2,87,12.0,Nahe,,,Riesling,Two Princes
16839,Spain,"Fairly bold and ripe up front, with dark berry aromas and an almond candy undercurrent. The palate is a bit more red-fruit based than the bouquet, and the flavors of raspberry and red plums are satisfying a touch tangy. Interesting, with drying tannins on the finish.",,87,18.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Val Montium
16840,Italy,"An attractively priced Primitivo-Aglianico blend that delivers a surprisingly delicate aromatic ensemble of forest berry, marzipan aromas. Firm tannins do need to unwind though. Pair with lamb, roasted pork or aged cheeses.",Tatu,87,12.0,Southern Italy,Primitivo del Tarantino,,Primitivo,Vigne & Vini
16841,US,"I really liked the winery's 2003 Cab Franc, for its dark, black fruits laced with licorice and streaks of tarry tannin. What's missing here is that defining structure; they've slipped this one into the soft, smooth, generic red category. Sweet fruit, some smoke and a bit more stiffness to the tannins still make this wine a relative standout, but it's lost its edge.",Proprietor's Reserve,87,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Franc,Maryhill

16843,US,"This is the first Viognier from Lost Canyon I've had, and it's very good.

16844,Australia,"A blend of 68% Pinot Noir and 32% Chardonnay, this is one of the lighter-bodied Australian sparklers, featuring fruit-forward aromas of pineapple, vanilla and coconut. Flavors of citrus and toast are more standard fare; the wine finishes with good length, suggesting a few years of cellaring will do it no harm.",Croser Pinot Noir-Chardonnay,87,30.0,South Australia,Piccadilly Valley,,Champagne Blend,Petaluma
16845,Argentina,"If you've never tried Argentine Bonarda, Chakana is a good place to start. The nose offers the varietal's typical vulcanized rubber and dark-fruit aromas, while the palate is smooth and full of straightforward blackberry. Complicated it's not, but it is pleasant.",,87,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Bonarda,Chakana
16846,France,"From a small Chablis producer, this is very soft, showing some ripe fruit but an amorphous structure; rather unfocused. There are plenty of creamy wood and sweet green-fruit flavors, but they need time to hang together better.",Fourchaume Premier Cru,87,,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Domaine de Vrignaud
16847,US,"They've upped the price, but Covey still makes the best under-$10 Pinot Grigio in the land. Prickly acids prop up moderately ripe flavors of stone fruits, pear, pineapple and green apple. This has punch and grip, and the persistent, palate-refreshing tartness takes away any undue sweetness.",Quail Series,87,9.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Pinot Grigio,Covey Run
16848,Spain,"Classic in every sense, from the early aromas of dill butter to the dry, acid-driven palate to the light, crisp finish. In a world where so many wines are going ripe and heavy, this one holds steady to the traditional. So if you're looking for an old-school Spanish red to go with tortilla espanola or lamb chops, this will do the trick.",Old Vines Reserva,87,17.0,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
16849,Hungary,"Soft and integrated aromas and taut flavors of blackberry, blackcurrant and smoke give this French-style wine class and poise. Its dry, clean quality, good structure and flavorful fruit means it will age well, but drink now and you will not be disappointed. Another thumbs up for Hungarian winemaking.",Barrique,87,29.0,Villány,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gere Attila
16850,Austria,"A crisp, austere wine; it is a little lean, but does show fine varietal character. Treat this as a good food wine, rather than as an apéritif.",Vom Schloss,87,18.0,Niederösterreich,,,Grüner Veltliner,Graf Hardegg
16851,Argentina,"Dark to the eye and nose, with aromas of rubber, black fruit and lots of sharp-edged oak. Wood more than fruit controls the front of the palate and the finish, but inbetween the folds you'll find plump berry and black pepper flavors. A nice Malbec but arguably a little heavy on the oak.",Famiglia Bianchi,87,18.0,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Malbec,Valentin Bianchi
16852,US,"Big, bold and a little obvious, this Chard's main feature is oak, and plenty of it. Smoky and charry, the wine also has big fruit, along the lines of apricot jam, peach cobbler and pineapples. Don't drink it too cold.",Reserve,87,55.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,ZD
16853,Austria,"The Kraxn (pronounced “KRAX-en”) is well-placed for Riesling, with its southern exposure close to the Danube river. The richness of the fruit shows through in this soft, open, opulent wine, with its pepper and white fruit flavors.",Kremser Kraxn,87,20.0,Kremstal,,,Riesling,Zimmermann
16854,Argentina,"This reserve-level Chardonnay isn't that expensive yet it shows considerably more balance and complexity than the winery's regular Chard.

This is complex, layered and persistent across the palate, opening up to ample stone fruit flavors, earthy notes, dried herbs and spice. Crisp, with sweetness, moderately concentrated flavors and a rich texture all in balance, if a little loose knit on the finish.",Trittenheimer Apotheke Spätlese,89,31.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Clusserath-Weiler
16958,US,"Shows the exotic side of Viognier, with crisp acidity and a dry minerality that gets the tastebuds whistling. The lime, quince, apricot, white flower and woodspice flavors finish with the briskness of a Sauvignon Blanc, only more opulent.",,89,18.0,California,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Central Coast,Viognier,3CV
16959,US,"Lovely aromatics mix floral, fruit and barrel components in equal proportion. The wine has some solid tannins, and sits in the mouth with a bit of gravitas. Wild cherry, raspberry, fresh herb, and a little stiffness to the finish. Definitely a wine to age a few more years.",Flat Block Estate,89,,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Bethel Heights
16960,Germany,"This boasts a pretty nose of peach, honeysuckle blossom, tangerine and cantaloupe and stony minerality. Lively, juicy texture with a medley of zesty citrus fruit, and fresh stone-fruit flavors. Hints of honey and blossoms and a lingering minerality linger on the finish.",Ürziger Würzgarten Kabinett,89,19.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Karl Erbes
16961,US,"Horse & Plow sourced organic grapes to craft this excellent Chardonnay, giving it the luxe treatment—handpicked, whole-cluster pressed, French oak barrel fermentation and aging nine months sur lee—and it shows. The wine is pretty, with a tropical bouquet that gives way to just enough oak-driven vanilla. Will age nicely but is also ready to drink now.",McFadden Farm,89,20.0,California,Mendocino,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Chardonnay,Horse & Plow
16962,US,"This enormously rich, extracted Pinot Noir will please flavor-forward fans. It's explosive in raspberries, cherries, cola, figs, bacon, orange zest and other umami tastes, wrapped into a silky texture and brightened with crisp acidity. Seems best now and for a year or two.",Los Alamos Vineyard,89,39.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,La Fenêtre
16963,US,"Much like the winery's Pinot Gris, this estate-grown Pinot Blanc is built around mineral-infused fruit that is immaculately clean and vividly refreshing.

16964,France,"Mineral, firm wine, although at the same time it has plenty of black plum fruits surrounding the core of dark tannins.

16965,Argentina,"Round, dense and correct on the nose, with heft and dark fruit aromas.

Friendly and well done for the price.",Serie A,89,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Zuccardi
16966,Germany,"Pale gold color, this has a rather reduced nose at first that slowly gives way to ripe stone fruit aromas and an earthy, savory note. Not very complex, but displays vibrant citrus and stone-fruit flavors that impart a pleasant tingle to the midpalate. Fairly light-bodied and easy drinking, with a moderate fruity finish.",,89,10.0,Rheinhessen,,,Riesling,Trullo
16967,US,"A little extra bottle age has helped this wine soften up, but it still seems to stop a bit short. The entry is firm and shows some Oregon herbal character, along with tart, wild berry and light baking spices. There is a vague hint of barnyard as well. The tannins are beginning to smooth out, and this can probably benefit from a few more years in the cellar.",,89,48.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,William Hatcher
16968,US,"Thick, heavy and jammy now, with blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors, balanced with good acidity. Almost rustic in the fruity concentration and tart acids. Your best bet is the cellar. Try after 2013.",,89,175.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,The Vineyard House
16969,US,"A good Grenache from the standpoint of a dry red wine. The wine is extraordinarily rich in cherry fruit, and is nicely silky, with firm, juicy acidity. Neutral oak adds just a touch of smoke. Drink now.",Camp Four Vineyard,89,28.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Grenache,Standing Sun
16970,Argentina,"A rich and creamy sort of Malbec that pours on the weight, extract and oaky, coconutty character. The palate is syrupy, with huge flavors of roasted berry, molasses and sweet spices. Arguably on the baked and heavy side, but definitely a rich, huge wine with just enough core acidity to keep it balanced.",,89,30.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Siesta
16971,South Africa,"Strong aromas of cassis, cocoa nibs, fresh mint sprigs, black currant leaf and licorice are the first things you experience with this wine.

16973,US,"A sexy nose with soft, pretty plum and cherry fruit leads into a well-rounded, satiny wine that coats the tongue like a velvet glove. The fruit is the star here—ripe strawberries and cherry candy—with a touch of sweetness and a lick of chocolate at the very end.",Heritage Cuvée,89,35.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Arbor Brook
16974,South Africa,"With 16 months in French and American oak, it should not be a surprise that this wine is as rich and wonderfully wood-spiced as it is. Earthy spice by way of clove, cinnamon sticks, anise root and cigar box bring the typical dark fruit flavors to another level. Balanced and drinkable now with a finish reminiscent of a tanned hide.",Pumphouse,89,22.0,Coastal Region,,,Shiraz,Backsberg
16975,Italy,"This is a mammoth wine with an inky, impenetrable appearance and intense aromas of dark spice, crushed black pepper, clove and every sort of mature black fruit you can imagine.

16977,France,"Soft barnyard mingles with dried thyme and lavender, adding complexity to the juicy plum, cherry and wild raspberry flavors. Creamy but firm, with gripping tannins and a cocoa-dusted finish. With 50% Syrah, 40% Grenache and 10% Carignan, this is an intense Minervois that can stand up to beef stew or braised short ribs.",Leukadios,89,18.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Minervois,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine Sainte Léocadie
16978,US,"This is a very good Cab to drink now for its firm, dry mouthfeel and ripe flavors of cherries, currants and cedar. It feels elegant and distinguished. But it's also thick in dusty tannins, and should slowly evolve in the bottle for 6–7 years.",,89,50.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Emblem

16980,Australia,"A solid, well-made offering, Grant Burge's unoaked Chardonnay offers a medium-bodied mouthful of authoritative flavor at a reasonable price.

It begs for a pairing with stewed game meat or crunchy roasted lamb.",A,87,16.0,Southern Italy,Irpinia,,Aglianico,Di Meo
16982,US,"This is 96% Cabernet Franc, and why the winery doesn't just call a spade a spade is beyond me. But that quibble aside, there is much to recommend here. The fruit is plenty ripe and tastes of strawberry, raspberry and cherry preserves. The oak flavors bring on the smoke and toast, and the natural tendency of Cab Franc to impart green coffee bean notes is also much in evidence. The tannins have been softened up, but still leave a lingering green tea impression in the back of the throat.",Sogno,87,36.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Di Stefano
16983,US,"I've always enjoyed this bottling for its exuberant white pepper opening and dry, tannic structure, and the '04 continues that tradition.

16985,US,"This follows along the same track as the 2003—moderately ripe with lightly herbal fruit mixing plum, blueberry and cherry.

16990,US,"Already in the bottle, this is set for a September release. Right now, it's a bit ruggedly tannic, although the flavors are spot on.

16999,Spain,"No doubt this wine possesses peppery, herbal qualities. But before it's dismissed as green we'd like to note that there's also a nice savory side to it.

17004,US,"This is their fifth vintage of merlot (started in 2000, but the '04 has been sourced from Columbia valley vineyards due to the freeze.

17055,Italy,"The color is light, but the Monchiero has pungent earthy aromas over a backdrop of fruit. On the palate, it is soft and quite chunky, and dominated by its earthiness. The wine has evolved completely, and should be drunk reasonably quickly.",,85,20.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba Superiore,,Barbera,Monchiero
17056,Austria,"Big, bold and soft, this is way too heavy. Sure, the Grüner spice is all there, but it is at the expense of a fresh, racy character. The toast character doesn't quite work either.",Schenkenbichl,85,48.0,Kamptal,,,Grüner Veltliner,Jurtschitsch
17057,US,"The vintage was a very ripe one, and the heat shows. It's very forward, almost jammy, in sweet strawberry and peach flavors. This robs the wine of some elegance and finesse, but it's still an attractive sipper.",Brut,85,25.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Domaine Carneros
17058,Italy,"The Pertinace evolved nicely in the glass; at first there are simple lime peel aromas, but over time, they become richer and slightly more complex. On the palate there is pear, as well as the lime and an interesting smoky quality. Crisp and with good balance, the finish is a little short. Imported by MW Imports.",,85,16.0,Piedmont,Roero Arneis,,Arneis,Pertinace
17059,Italy,"There is plenty to like in this wine with its rich dark fruit, Indian spices and leather but it also showed a slightly dank, wet fur character. On the palate, the animal quality had retreated to the side, and the fruit was dominant. Medium finish, a nice wine with a question mark.",Gaia Principe,85,45.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,,Nebbiolo,Prinsi
17060,New Zealand,"A savory style, one that focuses on woodsy, mushroomy, meaty complexity. If most New World Pinot Noirs are too fruity for your tastes, try this, as the the tannins are soft, the flavors complex. Drink now.",Falveys,85,28.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Omaka Springs
17061,Italy,"Some wines have a personality that makes you want to smile. This is one of them. A big, rich, friendly wine full of fruit that was approachable and easy to drink.

17063,Italy,"The Valdinara is a soft, seductive wine showing plenty of jammy fruit, and a pleasant smoky spice.

Pleasant, not very intense and easy to like.",,85,23.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba Superiore,,Barbera,Valdinera
17064,US,"This is a heavy, bitterly tannic young wine that shows ripe blackberry and coffee flavors and spices. The raw astringency makes it tough now, fit only for greasy foods like barbecued ribs. It should age well for a long time, but will never quite overcome its rustic profile.",,85,25.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Petite Sirah,X
17065,Italy,"The Einaudi is a fairly hefty version of a Dolcetto, having lost some fruit but gaining an interesting earthy character to the palate.

Should be drunk soon.",,85,21.0,Piedmont,Dolcetto di Dogliani,,Dolcetto,Poderi Luigi Einaudi
17066,US,"Some interesting tobacco scents open up the nose. In the mouth the wine is very tart, showing cool-climate flavors of plum, cassis and berry.

17068,Italy,"Little doubt from the nose what the grape was: archetypal Sauvignon Blanc. Lots of hay, wet grass a touch of green plums.

17069,US,"This Bordeaux blend has a different artist's label every year but otherwise has no identity of its own. This new release is tight, hot and shows signs of reduction; it's got a burnt rubber scent underlying the ultraripe, almost pruny fruit. It's just not a compelling wine; it hasn't jelled and it doesn't seem as if it will. There is concentration and power to be sure, but pleasure is in short supply.",Artist Series Meritage,85,48.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Chateau Ste. Michelle

17130,US,"A dry, somewhat metallic, austere mouthfeel marks the entrance of this Cabernet. It has an Old World touch of musty dryness throughout, and the black cherry fruit seems to be drying out already. Flavors are succinct and contained.

There's a slight herbal, spicy edge to the finish.",,86,30.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Foundry Vineyards

17141,Italy,"Hearty Negroamaro with 15% Malvasia Nera produce a wine that delivers surprisingly delicate tones of blue flowers, blueberry and vanilla.

17143,Australia,"Light and fresh, with only 12% alcohol, this Riesling from reliable producer Reilly's features scents of limes, wet stone and cinnamon, but doesn't show enough intensity of flavor to merit a higher rating.

17146,US,"Very dry, high in acidity and with a minty edge to the cherries and blackberries, this wine tastes young and raspingly tart right now. It's elegant enough in structure, but wants opulence. Hard to tell if it will go anywhere.",Alegria Vineyard,86,35.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Lost Canyon
17147,Argentina,"Starts out all rowdy and sweaty, with animal hide and warm earth. And that all makes sense: this is unoaked, unmolested Syrah and thus it has its funky side. Along the roadside there's blackberry and pepper flavors and peppy acids and tannins. An interesting ride that's not without its ups and downs.",Opalo,86,18.0,Mendoza Province,Vista Flores,,Syrah,Mauricio Lorca
17148,Germany,"Smoky, intense and petrolly on the nose, this medium-bodied Riesling goes 180 degrees on the palate, where the flavors are the more typical apple and lemon-lime. It's a touch oily, finishing with a tangy, citrusy edge.",180 degree,86,15.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,Milz-Lauretiushof
17149,US,"The biggest, richest, ripest, oakiest of Schug's current trio of Pinots, this wine is gigantic in fruit.

17154,Argentina,"We've been watching this wine for several years and it doesn't seem to be on the upswing. This vintage is good as Cabernet goes, but it comes across a little racy and jumpy.

Maybe another year will settle it down.",Particular,86,30.0,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Valentin Bianchi

17160,US,"Without doubt this is a wine to cellar. It's massive in flavor, with the purist blackcurrant and cassis fruit you can imagine, and the huge plaster of sweet oak is perfectly balanced. Then there are the tannins. They're fine and complex, but gritty. There's an astringency throughout that a great steak will cut through, but it would be infanticide to open this before, say, 2010.

17163,France,"It may be vendange tardive, but the sweetness is the least of this wine's qualities.

17267,Argentina,"Lively but also narrow on the nose. The feel is very fresh and juicy due to firm, bracing acidity that gives a tangy, lemony character to the wine's dark-fruit core.

17283,US,"Past vintages of Barrel Thief have been red blends, but in 2004 it's labeled Cabernet Sauvignon. The rest of the blend is Cab Franc and Merlot, so the Thief has gone a bit upscale, with visions of Bordeaux dancing in its head. Screwcapped and high-toned, there's nothing shy about this wine. It hits you head-on, dumps its plain fruit flavors and runs off, leaving a bit of volatile heat in the back of your mouth.",Barrel Thief,86,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dusted Valley
17284,US,"Slightly soapy and pungent, the aromas do not immediately suggest Sauvignon Blanc fruit.

17285,Argentina,"Simple red-fruit aromas, sweetness and balance come right away on the bouquet, and the palate is basically the same thing: pleasant strawberry and raspberry flavors and a good feel.

17287,US,"Sourced primarily from the estate's Carneros vineyards, this is entirely barrel-fermented in French oak. Yet the oak provides gentle accents rather than an outsized coating.

17288,US,"This is one of the winery's ripest, softest current Pinot releases. It's dry, but a bit heavy in mouthfeel, with a slightly stewed quality to the cherry and berry flavors.

17292,US,"This is dark and slightly murky, with sweet scents of cooked fruits and baking spices. Somehow it keeps the alcohol levels well down (13%) but the fruit flavors are ultra-ripe, pruney, and deep. There is a good long finish that delves into soy, earth, baking chocolate, vanilla and clove, and is undeniably fascinating.

17299,Spain,"There is much to like about this wine, particularly the cola and roasted fruit flavors that control the palate.

Drink now.",,86,46.0,Northern Spain,Cigales,,Tinto del Pais,Traslanzas
17300,US,"This vineyard-designate was first made in 2001, and not since. The tangy fruit shows red berry flavors, cranberry sauce, and some flatness in the mid-palate.

17303,US,"Merlot, Cabernet, Cab Franc, Sangiovese and Syrah all pour into this graceful and accommodating blend, particularly ripe and fruity in the excellent 2005 vintage.

17307,Argentina,"Spunky and funky on the nose, with some heat and bramble. There's definitely a gamy side to this wine, but as it airs it picks up more of Malbec's trademark feel and fruit.

Back to the mouth, there's pure, developed fruit, tobacco and earth notes; overall it's exactly what you want from a middle-age wine: minerality, smoothness and deep flavors.",Riserva Viacoste,92,28.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Fattoria Rodano
17314,Italy,"Broadly textured and rich, with dark aromatics leaning toward coffee, blackberry and a sniff of lemon zest. Dense plum, toast and licorice notes control the palate, and then a clean blast of chocolate rushes through. Very sweet and unctuous for Chianti, almost like dessert in a glass.",Giorgio Primo,92,75.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,La Massa
17315,US,"Baby Poux is what, you ask? The name of a particular block of grapes in the Champoux (pronounced shampoo) vineyard in Washington's Horse Heaven Hills, just now coming into maturity. Nice cherry and red currant fruit is matched to gorgeous new oak, with flavors of toast and graham cracker, butter cookie and caramel. This is a wine to put in the cellar and enjoy in 10-15 years.",Baby Poux,92,42.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sineann
17316,US,"After struggling with this vineyard for a number of years, Joe Benziger seems to have gotten a handle on this finicky mountain fruit. Even in this so-so vintage, the wine is complex and pleasurable, although tannic. Hold until 2008.",Vineyard Collection Ash Creek Vineyard,92,35.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Imagery
17317,France,"A fine, poised wine, fresh and vibrant, which just demands to be drunk. Flavors of orange zest and white currants are balanced by layers of tannin and acidity. A delicious wine, packed with flavor. Imported by Lauber Imports.",Schoffweg,92,47.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Alsace white blend,Domaine Marcel Deiss
17318,Italy,"Lush and extracted, with laser-beam intensity, smoke and all the black cherry and herbs you could ask for.

Modern in style, with a barrique-based personality.",Vigna del Sorbo Riserva,92,63.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Fontodi
17319,Italy,"Deep and modern, with ripe black fruit, bacon and cedar to the full-framed nose. The mouth is just as good, with dense plum, black cherry, prune and vanilla.

17320,South Africa,"Danie De Wets has steadily demonstrated both what he and the Robertson region--for many still an unknown--can deliver. He does it again in this convincing white, built (of course) on a solid Chardonnay fruit core. Rich but not sappy, it offers abundant flavor, a solid mouthfeel, elegant style and a spicy, long finish. An impressive white with balance and finesse well beyond its price and rustic origins.",D'Honneur,91,24.0,Robertson,,,Chardonnay,De Wetshof
17321,US,"Otis includes the oldest cabernet vines in Washington state, dating back to the 1950s, and has been a Columbia vineyard-designate since 1981. Black pepper and dried sage are its imprints, and Otis always makes a tight, ageworthy wine, not in the currently fashionable ultraripe mode. Lean and herbal, but deep and ageworthy.",Otis Vineyard,91,23.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Columbia Winery

17323,Italy,"No bargain here, but it is a an excellent wine, made evident by the spicy, minty nose that's packed with attractive nutty nuances, coffee and earth. Ripe and full, with fine structure, this Chianti is fresh, seductive and round. The cherry and leather flavors are on the money, and the tannins are right there.",Berardo Riserva,91,38.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Castello di Bossi
17324,US,"A fruit-driven Pinot Noir that still manages to evoke so many of the undergrowth, damp leaf aromas associated with this elusive grape variety. It has elegance, subtlety, mineral flavors and spicy, smoky, toasty wood. From vines that were first planted in 1982, this is a wine that should evolve well over five to 10 years.",Four Vineyards,91,46.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Robert Sinskey
17325,US,"Takes the usual formula of cherries, blackberries, cocoa and oak and kicks it up a notch.

The bottom line is elegance.",,91,32.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Barlow
17326,US,"Like the winery's syrah, this young wine shows a lot of spicy new oak at the moment, although the specs say only 30% of the barrels were new.

Plenty of power and punch for a pure merlot.",,91,25.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Beresan
17327,Germany,"Aromas of pure, sweet, dry botrytis follow through to a wine of great richness, sweetness and acidity on the palate.

17328,France,"A portion of the 111-acre Montirius vineyard is enclosed by ancient oak trees, which protect the vines from the searing winds of the Mistral normal in the Rhône valley.

Imported by Vintage '59 Imports.",Clos Montirius,91,25.0,Rhône Valley,Vacqueyras,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Montirius
17329,Italy,"Seriously well made, with a few years of cellar potential. The nose is rich and full, displaying molasses, coffee, bacon and cedar. Fine fruit on the palate, especially black plum.

Excellent balance, with tannins that show themselves before disappearing into the woodwork.",,91,32.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Brancaia
17330,Italy,"Friendly for a Chianti, with open aromas topped off by bacon, leather and bitter chocolate. Masculine enough, but not hard. The palate is bulky and filled with berry and plum flavors. Lasting, long and juicy toward the end, with firm tannins that act as pillars for the wine.",Don Vincenzo Riserva,91,80.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Casaloste
17331,Italy,"Highly complex and intriguing, given that it's also quite rich, extracted and modern. The color is violet, while the nose is bloated with cured meat, vanilla and dark cherry fruit. Rather thick and chewy, but balanced by proper acidity. A gem of wine, with a luscious mouthfeel.",Riserva Petri,91,30.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,,Sangiovese,Castello Vicchiomaggio
17332,France,"An intense, sweet wine, this is packed full of orange flavors, citrus fruits and a touch of smokiness.

17334,France,"Orange marmalade aromas set the scene for a fresh, intensely sweet wine.

17336,US,"Dense, deep and delicious. Among a fine group of CC reserves, this gets my vote for the best of all. Inky, tannic yet beautifully, classically varietal. Really dense, it delivers concentrated boysenberry and black fruit flavors, and the co-fermentation with viognier adds aromatic orange peel/citrus rind notes. Lively, perfumed and complex.",Reserve,91,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Columbia Crest
17337,US,"This is the wine formerly known as Claret. The new vintage is still young, grapey, looser and more broadly fruity than the sensational '01. But what's interesting are layers of ripe fruits, tar, mineral, dark chocolate and chalk. The wine just seems to constantly reveal more of itself as it sits in the glass.",Camille,91,48.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Nicholas Cole Cellars
17338,US,"From the Pepper Bridge and Seven Hills vineyards, this compelling syrah offers more than just crisp red fruits. I love the citrus rind, the floral lift, the hints of cinnamon and spice.

17339,US,"In 2000 the grapes for this wine struggled to get ripe. No problem in ‘01.

17344,Italy,"The nose was interesting; earthy with plenty of plummy fruit and a touch of musk.

17350,Italy,"A big, chunky wine that begins with pleasant aromas of dark, lush fruit and rose petals, it cannot sustain its promise on the palate. It starts well enough, but by midpalate, most of the fruit has gone, and the finish is short and a little dour.",,84,30.0,Piedmont,Nebbiolo d'Alba,,Nebbiolo,Pio Cesare

17352,US,"There's lots of exotic Viognier character packed into this fruity, slightly sweet wine. It's powerful in peach and pineapple flavors that are so ripe, they taste like melted jelly, with a hit of alcohol.",Marsha's Vineyard,84,22.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Viognier,Parkmon
17353,Italy,"Begins beautifully with a hint of honey, white flowers and fruit. The palate shows good acidity and the finish is longer than the other Arneis tasted. The problem is that within five minutes, a slightly sour note could be detected, which although not particularly strong never really disappeared. Overall a very nice wine that could have been very special.",Cascina Pioiero,84,17.0,Piedmont,Roero Arneis,,Arneis,Pioiero
17354,Italy,"This light-colored Cortese is an easy-going white that manages to be both very light and quite complex. The aromas of roasted peaches and apricots is lovely but low in intensity.

17360,US,"This Syrah was grown in Carneros in the cool, long '05 vintage, which may explain its minty sharpness, despite the low case production level.

17362,US,"This is showing an extraordinary amount of toasty oak in the nose, and once in the mouth it seems as if the oak and toast flavors overwhelm everything else. The fruit is very much on the light side, and can't begin to stand up to all the toast and butterscotch that is being tossed around. It's not bad, but it has not yet found its balance, and finishes with some lightly stemmy tannins.",Reserve,84,23.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Snoqualmie

17366,US,"The grapes come from the cooler Oak Knoll area of Napa Valley, yet this wine is very soft and melted, without much acidity to provoke and enliven the ripe cherry, vanilla and sassafras flavors.

17368,Argentina,"Olive, blackberry and toasty oak all give hope, but when this wine crosses the palate the acidity is so intense that it causes you to take count of your cheeks, tongue and teeth.

17375,US,"So dark, you can hardly see light through it. It's tannic, too, which makes for one big, heavy wine. But it's delicious, packed with blackberry jam, teriyaki beef, Dr. Pepper, dark chocolate and sweet sandalwood flavors.

Good price for a wine of this class.",Herrick Red,88,18.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Red Blend,Conn Creek
17403,US,"With a hint of blush in the color and a scent of rose petals in the nose, this aromatic and flavorful Gewürz invites contemplation. It's got some strong pine needle flavors along with light citrus and apple fruit, but the more interesting elements are the floral/soapy harmonics that dance along the edges.",Dry,88,12.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Gewürztraminer,Airlie
17404,US,"A portion of this is estate grown, the rest sourced from neighboring southern Oregon vineyards. Harvested at just 24 brix, it's an elegant style, with plenty of tart wild berry flavors, and alcohol under 14%.

17411,France,"Firm wine, with tannins to match the chunky structure. Black currant fruits go with acidity, green pepper and spice. It's a delicious wine from an almost unknown appellation in the central mountains of France.",Mansois,88,12.0,Southwest France,Marcillac,,Mansois,Lionel Osmin & Cie
17412,Germany,"The appealing nose of lemony-lime aromas features a hint of honey.

A nice earthy kick chimes in on the finish.",Kabinett,88,14.0,Rheinhessen,,,Scheurebe,Louis Guntrum
17413,US,"An interesting wine, somewhat sharp and yeasty upon entry, but also showing a creamy, textural midpalate with a streak of honey down the fruit flavors of pear and apple.

17414,US,"Very dry and pretty tannic, this cool-climate Syrah combines its blackberry and cherry fruit with less ripe notes of herbs and even a touch of asparagus.

17415,US,"This rich, sweetly fruity and creamy wine is almost dessert-like. It has vibrant tropical fruit and peach flavors that taste like they were baked into a pie.

17416,Argentina,"A tale of two wines. The early impression is that of a foxy, incomplete, sweaty wine with gaps in the fabric. But once it gets air, things turn around for the better. Ultimately it proves itself as a serious Malbec with a broad texture and jammy, sweet berry fruit. But it starts out so scattered and funky that it remains compromised.",Brote Negro,88,100.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Malbec,Viña Alicia
17417,Italy,"A distinctive expression of Nero d'Avola with ripe fruit flavors, blackberry preserves, tobacco, spice and leather.

17421,US,"With each bump up in price, the winemaker ups the percentage of new oak; here it's 25%.

17422,Argentina,"Earthy and rugged at first, then it smoothes out to show cola and lush berry aromas.

Very nice Malbec with a cool identity.",Reserve,88,19.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec,Salentein
17423,Italy,"Alastro is a food-friendly blend of Grecanico and Chardonnay. Grecanico adds fresh, floral aromas and the Chardonnay gives the wine its creamy, smooth texture.

17427,Italy,"The Feudo Principi di Butera estate releases this Cab five or more years after the harvest, although a good argument could be made that it should be released sooner. Tertiary aromas of mineral and dried spice do appear and there's not much fruit left (especially in the hot 2003 vintage). Nonetheless, the wine is elegantly aged: Drink now.",San Rocco,88,,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Feudo Principi di Butera

17434,US,"Lush and fruity, this has a raisiny, cooked prune quality to its fruit. It's sweet and roasted, easy-going, and fits in neatly with the winery's lineup of ripe, soft reds. But it could be almost anything in that lineup; it doesn't have any of the particular character that makes Washington Syrah so distinctive.",,85,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Maryhill
17435,US,"White Oak's Syrahs have been O.K. over the years—clean, dry wines that have some charm. What they lack is richness, as evidenced again by this '03.

17438,Lithuania,"Waves of citrus, apple and pear, balanced by a crisp minerality that keeps the wine aloft on the palate, recommend this semi-dry sparkler from Lithuania.

17439,Argentina,"For an average vintage this is an average wine. It has some bramble, leather and mild green notes to the nose, which are backed by red-fruit and brambly flavors.

17442,US,"A little sweet and high in alcohol for my taste, this wine, which winemaker Greg La Follette calls “a fruit riot,” indeed is explosive.

On the plus side are rich, dusty tannins and good acidity, which lend structure.",Talmage Bench Aldine Vineyard,85,32.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Zinfandel,Tandem
17443,Italy,"This is a distinctly uncommon wine with delicate nuances of pressed flowers, violets, leather, spice, nutmeg and licorice that sees no wood. High heat (and a whopping 17% alcohol) does not disturb as much as you'd think, although there is a disjointed spicy, peppery hot sensation on the palate.",Badde Nigolosu,85,80.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Romangia,,Cannonau,Tenute Dettori

17446,Argentina,"A little damp and heavy, with molasses, stewed berry and char on the nose. The palate, however, is fairly jumpy and alert; fiery berry flavors hit with force and some heat.

17454,Italy,"Some occasions call for a simple, genuine wine and this Sardinian red made with the Bovale grape fits the bill just fine. Aromas include red fruit, berries, vanilla, cedar and toast.

17455,Australia,"This medium-bodied Riesling may have just a touch of residual sugar to help bulk it up, but it stays true to the variety's floral, spice-scented nature.

17459,US,"This is a solid effort in a very difficult vintage. A freeze took out a lot of Washington grapevines in 2004, and it probably impacted the quality of the fruit available for this budget blend.

17801,US,"Similar in style to the winery's Cuvée A bottling, this had a little higher percentage of new French oak (still just one quarter total), and brings an earthier style to bear.

The limey finish seals the deal nicely, like a comforting signature.",,88,19.0,Walker Bay,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Southern Right

17828,US,"Of the winery's current crop of five Syrahs, this is the next most expensive, but it's hard to tell why. Possibly because most of the grapes come from Napa Valley, they paid more for fruit.

17845,Argentina,"Novus' basic Cab is probably a better wine for the money. This one seems to want to justify its reserve status by offering more oak.

18004,Argentina,"Wines can be big and loaded with everything, yet still be hard to enjoy. This is a case in point: It weighs in at 15% and brings searing aromas of tree bark, char and shoe polish.

18018,South Korea,"This is an approachable version of the slightly wild and dry red Meoru grape of South Korea.

18020,Spain,"No matter how you slice this up, it comes out smelling and tasting sharp and burnt. The nose is brambly and fiery, while the mouth is peppery and rough.

Made from mountain vineyards on Atlas Peak and benches in the Rutherford appellation, it combines intensity with elegance. Bursts with upfront, delicious blackberry, crème de cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wildly sweet on the midpalate, but then finish thoroughly dry.

18620,US,"A massive wine, decadent and splendid, and a worthy followup to the near-perfect 2008. Densely packed in fruit, it explodes in blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, minerals and sweet, toasty new oak. That richness is lifted to brilliance by the tannic structure, which is world class. So deliciously approachable, it's drinkable now, but it should develop over the next 6–8 years.

Blended with a few drops of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it shows massive flavors of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate and sweetly smoked cedar wood. Just superb and delicious, but tannic and locked down in astringency. If you can keep your hands off it, cellar this beauty.

18648,US,"This is an unusually buttery wine, as if it had been put through some special sort of malolactic fermentation. It feels manipulated, softened and buttered up, with the fruit subdued. Traces of herb remain, but they are like shadows on the wall. Perhaps the house style does not accommodate this particular vineyard's character.

18653,US,"This dry Riesling has a steely spine running right through the heart of the wine; you can almost taste the metal. It defines and confines the flavors; the fruit seems like an afterthought.

With explosive blackberry, cassis, blueberry, dark chocolate and oak flavors, it's almost too much of a good thing. Your best bet is to cellar it, but that's chancy.

18682,US,"The vineyard has been source to Pinot Noirs from Copain and Drew, and this one, from Winemaker Jon Grant shows a somewhat Cabernet-esque interpretation. The wine is dark, tannic and medium-bodied, and quite extracted in the flashily ripe cherry and cola fruit that Monument Tree ripens so well in a cool, long hangtime year like 2010. Despite the richness, this is an elegant, ageworthy wine, whose low alcohol will delight many who critique California Pinot Noir for clumsiness.

18729,US,"Lusty, powerful, ripe and concentrated, this Zin could also be described by the old Yiddish word, zaftig. The vineyard is in a warm part of the valley, and the grapes show the influence of sun and heat in the jammy, slightly baked quality of the cherries and blackberries. It's a really fine example of Russian River Zinfandel.",Butler Vineyard,93,36.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,De Loach
18730,US,"You'll find plenty of fruit, in the way of ripe mangoes, peaches, green apples and limes, as well as a sweet coating of smoky oak. However, it's elevated by brisk acidity and a stony, tangy minerality that must come from the soil of this cool-climate vineyard.",Hawk Hill Vineyard,93,44.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,De Loach
18731,France,"The heavy bottle leaves little doubt that this is the top wine from Château Eugénie. Inside is an impressive, beautifully balanced wine.

18733,US,"This Syrah was grown and produced by the winery owners, and held back almost five years before release. That's an impressive act of courage, but it has benefited the consumer. The wine, while still somewhat tannic, feels mellow, with a complex array of black fruits and berries, grilled bacon, sweet tobacco, dark chocolate and, above all, freshly crushed black pepper. An impressive Syrah that should change in interesting ways over the next six years.",,93,38.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,Occidental Road Cellars
18734,US,"The majority Cab Sauvignon in the blend brings classic blackberry and cassis flavors, as well as firm tannins.

18735,US,"The wine is stunning, full of bright red fruit and a soft tinge of French bread, tightly structured with dark wood and a leathery component.

18736,Portugal,"Rich and concentrated, this is a wine that has the Dão structure. It has an austere minerality from the hard granite soi, which is layered with enticing ripe black-fruit flavors.

18738,US,"Stylish, precise, elegant and evocative, the Jessie may be the best of an excellent single-vineyard lineup from Cristom in 2009.

18779,Argentina,"Rather jammy, murky and generic on the nose, with black-fruit aromas that center around plum and blackberry. The palate is edgy but fresh, with snappy, tarry black-fruit flavors.

18780,US,"Plenty of tough mountain tannins in this classically-huge Howell Mountain Cabernet. Combined with dryness and acidity, it makes for one tough drink.

It's dry, richly textured in tannins, and complex, offering intense waves of blackberries, black currants, crème de cassis and oak. Yes, the alcohol is high, but who's counting? As good as it is now, it should develop bottle complexity over the next 4–6 years.",,93,55.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frazier
18784,Italy,"Serpico is a bold, larger-than-life wine, with beautiful aromatic intensity and notes of black fruit, espresso and crushed granite.

18787,US,"Just beautiful to drink now, despite grippy tannins that give the ripe fruit an astringent mouthfeel. Based on Cabernet Franc, the wine's flavors are simply delicious, offering waves of cherries, blueberries, plums and currants. Plenty of new oak adds toasty vanilla. Those tannins suggest pairing this wine with rich foods, such as lamb, but you don't want to smother the delicacy underneath a rustic stew.

Age 6–8 years.",Prieuré de Cenac,92,25.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Château Saint-Didier-Parnac
18794,US,"Made mainly from Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a big, massively structured wine. It offers an explosion of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate and sweet, caramelized oak.

18796,US,"Made from mountain grapes, this is an extraordinarily rich, concentrated young Cabernet Sauvignon. It's marked by classic varietal flavors of blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and cassis liqueur.

18799,US,"This is a great Napa Valley Merlot, from a winery with a generally good track record with the variety.

18802,US,"With firm acidity and big tannins, this Cabernet is nowhere ready to drink. It shows an almost old-time Howell Mountain aggressiveness.

18808,US,"A good followup to last year's bottling, although the wine isn't quite as ripe and lush. The cool vintage has brought out a tannic earthiness, as well as a blast of black pepper that makes the blackberry and blueberry fruit tingly on the tongue.

18904,US,"This polished wine offers an array of ripe cherry, pomegranate, persimmon and cola flavors, making it rich and sweet in the mouth.

18907,US,"Some will critique this Pinot as too big and bold, but it defines the ripe, exuberant California style. It's fabulously rich in berry fruit, mocha and spice flavors. Nothing shy about it, and not particularly subtle in its appeal, but it does show meticulous vineyard care and terroir.

18910,Germany,"Textbook fruchtig Riesling—but with the volume turned up to 11. The flavors of honeyed apple, nectarine and lime are sweet and the wine round and plump in the mouth, but then electric acids kick in, providing great balance through the long finish.

18915,US,"Smooth and already a seamless, complex and compelling whole, this estate-grown reserve overdelivers for the price.

18925,Italy,"This offers just about the biggest, boldest aroma and taste profile you will ever find in an Italian red.

The finish shows crushed stone and powdered black licorice.",Le Vigne a Capanno,91,,Southern Italy,Aglianico del Vulture,,Aglianico,Tenuta del Portale
18926,US,"Soft upon entry, this is a lush and plummy wine, with a rich mix of purple and somewhat grapy fruit flavors.

18927,US,"A deliciously priced blend of 60% Mourvèdre, 13% Syrah and 27% Grenache that'll be tricky to ask for by name but is worth the effort to find and share.

18941,US,"Another entry into the under-$15 Oregon Pinot category, that has become rather crowded in the past year.

18942,Argentina,"A Malbec-led blend that's off the grid by Argentine standards but which reflects the northern Salta region.

18944,Argentina,"Murky and leathery on first take, with dry, earthy red fruit aromas emerging later on.

18961,US,"Sometimes in a challenging vintage such as 2009, it is the least expensive, blended wines that benefit most, perhaps because grapes normally destined for the single-vineyard wines are redirected.

18996,Germany,"The Blue Fish Rieslings are decent efforts from the Niederkirchen cooperative. The 2009 Sweet Riesling features ripe pear and melon balanced by crisp pineapple notes.

19033,US,"You might almost think this is a Pinot Noir, it's so silky, crisply acidic and rich in raspberries, cherries, red licorice and sandalwood.

19185,US,"Very light in color and, alas, pleasing flavors, this 100% Sauvignon Blanc from the Langtry Estate's organically farmed Lillie VIneyard begins with guava and coconut, very tropical, but gives in too easily to a not quite ideal level of sweetness and a finish that can only be described, unhappily, as bitter.",Lillie Vineyard,84,20.0,California,Guenoc Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Sauvignon Blanc,Langtry

19212,US,"If you're used to soft, ripe Napa Valley Cabernet, this one, grown just over the Lake County border, will strike you as dry and unyielding.

Age for two years.",Q de Sant'Ana,90,28.0,Portuguese Table Wine,,,Pinot Noir,Quinta de Sant'Ana
19214,Portugal,"The top wine from Quinta Nova is hugely rich, rather extracted and over the top.

19228,US,"This vineyard bottling is very vintage driven. The cool 2009 harvest has made it ripe and tart in cherry pie flavors, but also rather tannic.

19274,US,"V. Sattui has been making some pretty good Cabernets, and here's another one. It's classic Napa, with smooth, polished tannins, fine acidity and ripe, full-bodied flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar. Might even develop additional bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years.",,90,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,V. Sattui
19275,US,"There's no oak on this delightfully dry wine, although you'd never know it from the rich streak of vanilla and smoky butter that accompanies the orange, apricot, lime and honey flavors. It's a brilliant success, bright and zesty in acidity, and one of the most satisfying Pinot Gris on the market.",Paragon Vineyard,90,17.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Gris,Tangent

High quality for $20 Cabernet.",Reserva de Familia,90,20.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Carolina
19279,Germany,"This wine's calling card is its electric acidity, which provides a poignant counterbalance to the wine's plump feel on the palate. Ripe citrus notes of pineapple and orange offer plenty of flavor to go along with the superb length. It's ready to drink, yet should prove capable of aging at least 5–6 years.",Vom Schiefer Trocken,90,18.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Ansgar Clüsserath

19282,US,"A somewhat pale wine, at first reluctant to show much aroma, it ultimately reveals itself to be elegant and surprisingly deep.

Complex and lovely.",,90,20.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Illahe
19283,Chile,"Concentrated and earthy up front, with aromas of blackberry, boysenberry, graham cracker, leather and a whack of robust oak just for good measure.

19285,US,"The Shea is a bit of an anomaly at 13.7% in a vintage where the other Ken Wright Pinots float around the 12–12.5% mark. Not surprisingly, the fruit is thicker and the midpalate more full and broad, with pleasing cherry-berry flavors framed in chocolaty oak. Though not as aromatically complex as its companions, it offers plenty of rich fruit flavor.",Shea Vineyard,90,50.0,Oregon,Yamhill-Carlton District,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Ken Wright
19286,US,"A beautiful, bargain-priced blend of Tinta Roriz (aka Tempranillo), Touriga Nacional, Touriga Francesa and Alvarelhão. Violet and jasmine perfumed, this wine is so, so pretty with just a stunning nose. In taste, there's raspberry, strawberry and lilting layers of pepper and herbs.

19294,US,"There's an unripe, vegetal taste that detracts from the wine's otherwise fine qualities. It's dry and crisp and minerally, with pineapple fruit. But that asparagus edge is annoying.",,82,34.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Boekenoogen
19295,Argentina,"Loud, oily and almost caustic on the nose, with a chemical burn. The palate is better due to its tangy citric flavors, but it's still jumbled and oily, and the finish leaves a burnt-tasting residue.",,82,10.0,Other,Salta,,Torrontés,Tilia

19298,Argentina,"Roasted and leathery on the nose, without much fruit. The palate is full, rubbery and baked tasting, with herbal berry flavors.

19320,US,"Off-dry, this succulent wine has you smacking your lips rather than puckering them.

19321,US,"This wine presents an old-fashioned style, marked by hard, numbing tannins that frame ripe flavors of blackberries, licorice, cherries, mocha and black currants.

19327,US,"Cabernet specialist Venge brings its vision of big, bold wines to Chardonnay, with mixed results. The wine is huge and fruity, with massive pineapple, pear, crème brûlée, buttered toast, caramel and vanilla spice flavors, in which oak obviously plays a part.

19338,US,"An early freeze shut down the vineyards in 2009, and produced wines that are less immediately generous than the ripe, fruit-driven 2008s. The vanilla wafer aromas from barrel aging show prominently here, with the wild berry fruit being tart and so compact as to be almost invisible at first.

19363,US,"Often considered the iconic Cayuse wine, this bears the cartoonish label with the leering frog, though it is a single-vineyard offering like the others.

19375,US,"This includes grapes from Block One (the 1972 planting) and several other more recent plantings at Champoux; essentially this is pure Cabernet Sauvignon. It smells like a fine Bordeaux, still very young and tight, with well-defined layers of flavor.

19449,US,"One hundred percent Syrah from the Watch Hill Vineyard, in the Los Alamos Valley section of Santa Barbara County. It's very new-oaky now, with an explosion of buttered toast, char, vanilla and wood tannins. Underneath is a funky red wine just waiting to emerge. Already showing notes of bacon, teriaki beef and massively ripe blackberries. A helluva wine, impressive and dramatic. The big question is what will it do? Should develop for an additional 4–6 years.",Kubernetes,94,75.0,California,California,California Other,Syrah,Sanguis
19450,US,"This lush wine epitomizes the modern Napa style of soft richness and extreme drinkability when young.

It's certainly a big wine that floods the mouth with blackberry, black currant, cassis and new oak flavors. The tannins and acids make it aloof, resistant, tough. It wants time in the cellar.

19608,US,"Couldn't get any riper, with an explosion of blackberries, cherries, currants, plums, and cola, not to mention plenty of toasty, caramelized oak. Trades complexity and subtlety for sheer power. It's mostly Merlot, with a splash of Syrah, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc.",The Puzzle,88,80.0,California,Napa,,Red Blend,Newton

19610,Portugal,"Blending Riesling and Gewürztraminer, this wine benefits from the pure steeliness of the former and the spice of the latter. This wine has a honeyed character, balanced by intense acidity and dry botrytis. Great paired with berry fruits.",Late Harvest,88,25.0,Tejo,,,Portuguese White,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima
19611,US,"Here's a nice Sauvignon Blanc for drinking now. It shows how well this variety grows in the warmer parts of the county, with citrus, apricot, peach and spice flavors. Crisp acidity provides zesty balance to this deliciously drinkable young wine.",,88,19.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,Straight Line
19612,US,"New French oak dominates this wine, in the form of caramel and buttered cinnamon toast. Those are delicious flavors, of course, but they have little to do with the wine itself, which seems just fine, suggesting sour red cherries, red currants and licorice. Maybe it's just going through an awkward phase, or maybe it's the alcohol, which officially clocks in at 16% by volume, emphasizing the sweetness.",District Collection,88,75.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Raymond
19613,Chile,"Coconut is the lead aroma, but there's graphite, cool earth, cola, blackberry and raw oak on the bouquet.

19615,US,"An intensely fruity Petite full of plum and aromas of strawberries dipped in chocolate. Blended with 10% Mourvèdre, the wine is soft and round, with tame tannins. It finishes long, with a taste of char and Sweet Tarts, in a good way.",,88,24.0,California,Calaveras County,Sierra Foothills,Petite Sirah,Twisted Oak
19616,US,"This wine is a great example of why Riesling is so increasingly popular. Despite the “dry” title on the label, it's actually a bit off-dry and crisp in acidity, with clean, savory flavors of limes, kiwi fruits, honey and vanilla. So easy to like, and the alcohol is relatively low.",Dry,88,20.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Riesling,V. Sattui
19617,Chile,"Shy and clean on the nose, which offers up only mild grapefruit and lime. The feel is tight and stony, with pithy citrus and green apple flavors.

19618,Italy,"This opulent, almost sweet blend of Primitivo and Merlot shows bold fruit nuances of cherry liqueur and blackberry pie, backed by touches of leather and moist pipe tobacco. Those chewy fruit tones give the wine a soft, velvety sensation on the close.",Primitivo-Merlot,88,,Southern Italy,Tarantino,,Red Blend,Matané
19619,US,"With 15.4% alcohol by volume, this is arguably Lail's ripest, hottest Cabernet ever. It certainly has flashy blackberry and cherry jam flavors, with plenty of toasty oak, but there's a raisin-and-prune, overripe finish. Could age, but it's more likely that the heat will pinch in within six years, crushing the fruit.",J. Daniel Cuvée,88,135.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lail
19620,Portugal,"A structured, elegant and concentrated wine. It is dominated by tannins, by its mineral structure and its black currant fruit. There are juicy acidity, firm tannins and a great sense of style. Still young from a fine Douro vintage, it needs several years to mature.",Old Vines Reserva,93,45.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Duorum
19621,Italy,"Here's a Riserva expression of Amarone that shows beautiful intensity and velvety softness in the mouth.

19622,US,"This is 80% Sangiovese and 20% Syrah; an overlooked treasure from the LeFore vineyard, one of the original plantings in the Rocks. It is now beginning to show more genuine Sangiovese character as it moves into its second decade. Spicy berry with a strong coffee back, and the juicy acidity of the grape providing the structure. It finishes with a bright cinnamon streak. Delicious.",Guido Red,93,40.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sangiovese-Syrah,K Vintners
19623,US,"The Phil Lane, from a small vineyard that adjoins the winery, is refined and elegant in the context of the K Vintners Syrah pantheon. This has a generous amount of herb and organic/umami flavor, and the fruit is a component, but not dominant. A contemplative wine, with a subtle weave of herb, earth and berry. The acids are not yet entirely integrated, but that's a minor caveat.",Phil Lane,93,70.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,K Vintners
19624,US,"The acidity and dryness on this Pinot stand out. It's not a blockbuster, but keeps its exuberance under tight control, offering tantalizing cherries, currants, cola and Indian spices, wrapped in a cloak of minerals. Very elegant, detailed and silky. Lovely now, with a good decant, and should develop complexity over the next 10 years.",Bucher Vineyard,93,54.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
19625,US,"A great Weir from Williams Selyem, showing a complex balance on the warm-cool-climate spectrum.

19626,US,"Mainly Roussanne, with a dollop of Viognier, this brilliant white wine is largely from the Santa Valley, which accounts for its brilliant ripeness. Just massive in white flowers, fresh white peaches, yellow apricots, pears, sautéed bananas, toasted coconut, vanilla and firm minerals. Lots of new oak, but the underlying wine easily supports it. A tremendous, impressive wine.",Acromion,93,70.0,California,California,California Other,White Blend,Sanguis
19627,US,"One sniff of this terrific Pinot Noir, and your brain knows it's the good stuff. From the ruby color to the fresh, jammy plum, cherry, cola and beef jerky flavors, it's just a terrific wine. Enormously complex and velvety in the mouth, it should improve over the next four years.",Melville Vineyard,93,46.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Samsara
19628,Italy,"Monte Cà Bianca shows the very best of Valpolicella tradition and territory. The Begali family had been selling grapes to Bolla for decades before breaking off to make their own wine.

19629,US,"This blend of Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc in a half bottle is very sweet, with a residual sugar of 11.8%.

19632,Spain,"Pungent up front, with dry bayberry, leather, jam notes and schisty minerality. The palate is all about structure, snappy acids, sinewy tannins and lively, full-force red-fruit and plum flavors.

19635,US,"A brilliant Bordeaux blend, just captivating for its lush fruit, elegance and classy balance. Remarkable for the integrity of tannins, so sturdy and refined, so pure and sweet. A feminine wine, to judge by its soft allure, and yet packed with power and integrity. Beautiful now, although it's easily one for the next five to seven years.

19636,Portugal,"Dark in color, as befits a wine that was food trodden in open fermenters.

It needs several years aging.",Duas Quintas Reserva Especial,93,67.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Ramos-Pinto
19637,US,"Made from an unusual blend of Roussanne, Malvasia Bianca and Viognier, with the grapes grown in the Santa Maria and Santa Ynez valleys of Santa Barbara. The wine is strongly flavored, offering waves of apricot jam, lychee, pineapples and honey, with a very long, spicy finish. Dazzles for its depth and power.

19645,US,"This is the winery's Artist Series Cabernet, grown primarily in Calistoga, and it's a good example of the 2006 vintage, which was not a strong one for Cabernet Sauvignon.

20203,US,"Rich in tropical fruit and citrus flavors and generously oaked, this Chardonnay is made in the modern style, designed to appeal.

20205,Chile,"Toasty oak yields a smoky nose, but the fruit aromas are mild and hidden, showing only basic apple notes.

Ditto on the finish, which feels solid and good.",Clava Coastal Reserve,86,12.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Chardonnay,Quintay

20219,France,"A toasty streak frames the overall character of this wine, resulting in aromas and flavors of wood-grilled peaches and lightly roasted walnut shells.

20223,US,"Very dry, fairly tannic and acidic, with a tart bite that makes the flavors even more austere than they are. But it's a complicated, interesting wine, obviously pedigreed.

20225,France,"Typical for Tardieu-Laurent, this wine is strongly marked by its barrel treatment, which may be enough to put off traditionalists.

20229,France,"This is not just a late harvest wine, because there are definite dry flavors of botrytis grapes. While the obvious spice of the Gewürztraminer is subdued by the richness and sweetness, it still has all the fat, opulent character of the grape.

20233,US,"In 2009, it's the Pinot Gris (at 60%) that dominates this two-grape blend; the rest is Viognier.

20234,US,"A well-balanced, taut Syrah, walking the tightrope between juicy and astringent, with a forceful minerality under the fresh berry fruit.

20235,US,"A really good Zinfandel that not only shows delicious flavors, but a wonderful structure.

20239,Chile,"A big and meaty Syrah that separates itself from the competition via inviting aromas of blackberry and lemon peel.

20242,Portugal,"Aged in wood (there is no doubt about that from aroma and palate), this is potentially a rich, smooth, oily textured wine.

There's also vanilla, melon and baked apple aromas in front of a zesty, clean palate that's packed with salty, ocean-influenced apple, pineapple and citrus flavors.

20249,US,"The winery says this very rich 100% Cabernet comes from the Beckstoffer Georges III vineyard, which is in between Highway 29 and the Silverado Trail, although it doesn't say so on the label. The wine is marked by gigantic and somewhat sweet fruit, in the form of blackberry, cherry and raspberry jam. It's awkward now, but seems to have a useful lifespan.

Long but basic tasting come finishing time.",Reserva,86,13.0,Casablanca Valley,,,Pinot Noir,Morandé
20261,Chile,"Yellow tinted, which announces that this wine was barrel aged. And that barrel character is huge on the nose, which smells of raw oak, vanilla and dried cheese. Feels creamy, but the acidity is lively as well. Shows flashes of brilliance but also fights to absorb all the wood that's been thrown at it.

20291,Australia,"Angove's deserves credit for its effort to step up the quality of its wines in the Vineyard Select series.

20296,US,"There's a textbook quality to this Zinfandel. You could use it in a teaching class as expressing the classic California attributes of the variety. It's perfectly dry, not too high in alcohol, firm in tannins, and deeply flavored in dark stone fruits and berries. And then there are the freshly crushed peppercorns, black, red, green and white. Could be the perfect barbecue wine.",,90,16.0,California,Mendocino County,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Zinfandel,Bonterra

20298,US,"Brilliant, mouthwatering acidity marks this refreshingly clean wine. It's very ripe, showing pineapple and lemon sour candy, papaya, green melon and vanilla spice flavors.

20301,US,"Tight when first opened, with polished fruit flavors of blackberry and cassis, mingling with barrel accents of anise and clove.

20316,US,"Given its modest price and weighty alcohol, this wine should find many admirers.

20661,Chile,"Opens with mild green, minty aromas that suggest tobacco, Middle Eastern spice and basic black fruit.

20754,Chile,"Seems old due to mild vegetal aromas infiltrating the wine's core aromas of banana, vanilla and melon.

20762,US,"Upscale and pedigreed, but not showing well now. Too tannic, with an astringent lockdown that accentuates the acidity. Underneath are fine black cherry, cola, pepper and oak flavors.

20764,Spain,"Not a lot of glaring aromas of a sweet wine here; in fact, it's showing fresh tomato, cherry and more dryness on the nose than candy or syrup.

20774,Australia,"For a vintage-style fortified, this wine's color is appropriately intense and dark, but the tannins are somewhat tame.

20778,Chile,"An interesting and unsual wine for Chile. Hailing from grafted vines originally planted to Chenin Blanc in 1956, this Viognier is superfloral, with oily aromas along with apple blossom, nectarine and apricot. The palate has nice natural acidity and sweet flavors of melon, mango and citrus. A little big and unfocused and sweet, but still intriguing and nicely made.",Visión,88,13.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Viognier,Cono Sur

20783,France,"Dominated by aromas of dried spices, cedar and leather, this full-bodied, lusty red shows more oak than fruit, although the tannins are clearly ripe and the body of the wine adequately supports the ample cedar and vanilla flavors.

21416,US,"A crisp wine, dry and clean, with citrus, green apple and lemongrass flavors. A small percentage of new oak adds toast, while sur lie aging brings a tart creaminess.

21532,Chile,"Sweet on the nose, with a lot of mocha, vanilla and candied fruit. The palate is tannic and very oaky for a wine of this level.

21753,Spain,"Medicinal, sweet and short on complexity for a wine of this price. The palate has a choppy, rough feel and then comes an onslaught of medicinal berry flavor that leads to a tight, biting finish that's big on acid and low on depth of flavor and intracacies you might expect for $80.

21758,Chile,"Neutral on the nose to the point of dull and mute. The palate is more wet than complex, and the flavors of apple, candy and toffee are basic at best.

22016,US,"Disjointed, sharp, astringent and thin, this shows little of the varietal character usually associated with grapes from the outstanding Destiny Ridge vineyard.

22021,US,"This is a GSM blend—about two-thirds Syrah—loaded with juicy acidity. The sappy, deep raspberry fruit sinks into the palate, racy and penetrating.

22023,US,"A dry, tannic young Pinot Noir. It's not a big, gushy wine, but comes down more on the elegant side, with low alcohol and an earthiness to the cherry and cola fruit.

22058,Spain,"Smells strange, with a mix of unknown spice and odd fruit aromas. The palate is snappy and sharp, with light fruit and oaky, resiny flavors that leave a lasting, confounding aftertaste.

22357,Argentina,"A savory and smoky wine that impresses with its licorice, spice and bacon aromas along with corpulence and length. There's more than enough oak here, but the sandalwood, mocha and wood-driven spice notes blend into the wine's big-berry fabric rather than dominate.

22418,US,"Syrah is a core strength of Darby, and as with previous vintages, this is dense and aromatic, leading from floral scents into a dark, almost broodingly deep core of blackberries, cassis and pepper. Full-bodied and 14.4% alcohol, this captures the essential strengths of Washington Syrah, done as a fruit-driven, berry-laden style.",The Dark Side,92,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Syrah,Darby
22419,US,"Sharp, phenolic and edgy, with bright fruit and intensity, this southern Rhône blend brings in a lush mix of Meyer lemon, tangerine, orange peel, pink grapefruit, and even a little pineapple.

22420,US,"Tough to appreciate now due to its acidity and tannins, which lock it down behind a cloak of impenetrability. There are exotic wild raspberry and cherry fruit, cola, licorice, Provençal herb, bacon and pepper flavors, but you can't quite get to them, because they're behind bars. Obviously needs time. Give it 3–5 years in the cellar, and it should begin to blossom after that.",Occidental Vineyard,92,120.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Evening Land
22421,US,"A barrel selection of lots the winery has to choose from, this is Failla's highest priced Pinot. It's clearly a very fine wine, dry, crisp in coastal acidity and complex. The flavors now range from cherries and currants to cola and tomato juice, wrapped into firm tannins. Not showing delicacy or opulence now, but a Pinot Noir to cellar. Better after 2013.",Vivien,92,75.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Failla
22422,France,"Showy, spicy, with fresh fruits and lightness. This is a wine more about red cherries, bright acidity and a smooth texture. The tannins form a strong core, never weighty. Not for long-term aging.",Les Epenots Premier Cru,92,,Burgundy,Pommard,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Parent
22423,France,"There is plenty of the proper power and intensity of a Chambertin here, resulting in a structured wine.

22424,US,"A very successful Cabernet that continues the winery's string of mountain bottlings. It's dry and classically balanced, with a firm minerality bracing flavors of blackberries, black currants, herbs, spices and smoky oak. The firm tannins are a bit numbing now, so give it 3 or 4 years in the cellar to settle down.",,92,45.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Martin Ray

22426,US,"Another successful release from Stromberg after the fine 2005 vintage, and it makes the case for Dry Creek Cabernet at its best. Hillside grapes have yielded concentrated flavors of blackberries, plums and spices, and the wine is finely balanced with dense tannins and acidity.

Elegant and complex, it's a gorgeous wine to drink now.",,92,30.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stromberg Vineyards
22427,US,"Brilliantly aromatic, this wine beguiles with exotic scents of plum pudding, spice cake, cherry compote, pipe tobacco, red licorice and raspberry jam.

22428,US,"A lovely and complex Cabernet from this mountain in the southerly Mayacamas chain.

Drinkable now for sheer decadence, although it also seems to have the stuffing to age for a decade.",,92,70.0,California,Mount Veeder,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Craig
22429,US,"Not clear if this is a long-term ager, but you definitely want to give it a good decanting of at least four hours. You should even pour the glasses and let them to stand for an hour. The interaction with oxygen will open the wine up and allow it to express its herbal, soft deliciousness.

22433,US,"The score reflects the potential of this Cabernet down the road, as right now it's very tight and hard in mountain tannins.

Best after 2013.",,92,70.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Craig
22434,France,"The wine is defined by its power and dense concentration. It shows solid black fruits, plums, fig and licorice as well as dark tannins. It seems a little austere at this young stage and needs several years to flesh out.",,92,299.0,Burgundy,Charmes-Chambertin,,Pinot Noir,Louis Latour

22439,US,"The blend in 2006 is 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 36% Syrah, 10% Petit Verdot and 9% Cabernet Franc. It spent 30 months in 90% new oak. Released a year ago, it has a feminine grace and softness in the aromas, a lovely mix of flowers and spice.

22444,Australia,"Not the darkest, biggest or richest Shiraz to ever come out of Australia, this is nevertheless a delightful wine.

22515,Croatia,"There's so much nuance and complexity in this rustic yet fascinating Croatian wine, that it takes a while to break down its components. Initial scents of dried leaves and mulch blow off to reveal an array of delicate floral and fruit aromas, accented by rich chocolate and vanilla notes.

Especially noble is the tannin structure, firm and soft, dry and sweet, a combination of opposites. The depth is vast, and the spicy finish goes on for a long time, suggesting the wine's concentration.

It's soft, lush and opulent in blackberry, cherry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors. Although it was aged in 100% new French oak, the oak isn't at all heavy. Rather, it's perfect, adding just the right touch of smoke. Really fabulous, and the tannins define Stags Leap, so strong yet sweetly refined.

Shows massive blackberry, blueberry, crème de cassis and oak flavors packed into profoundly beautiful tannins. The fruit is so sweet that it's surprising how dry the finish is.

Yet it's not obtrusive at all, and just adds hints of honey, vanilla and toast to the wine's already complex flavors, encompassing lilac blossoms, fresh greens, peach and tangerine.

24939,Portugal,"Chewy tannins presage a firm, ageworthy wine. At this stage, it is all bitter chocolate and extraction, the fruit not evident. Dark, brooding, feeling heavy, this needs many years for the tannins to soften.",Reserva,89,45.0,Alentejano,,,Portuguese Red,Monte do Pintor
24940,France,"A solid, foursquare wine, flaunting its tannins but not forgetting the rich weight of fruit underneath. Mint flavors go with the chocolate and dark plums.",Caractère,89,20.0,Bordeaux,Côtes de Bourg,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château de la Grave
24941,Spain,"Interesting and very much showing Navarran qualities, including aromas of black olive, herbs and mossy fruit.

24962,US,"This is basically a Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon, with a hefty dollop of Petite Sirah.

24993,New Zealand,"Possibly just in a sullen phase, this reserve bottling from Craggy's home vineyard is dominated for the moment by smoke and cedar on the nose, and while there is some cherry fruit apparent in the mouth, it doesn't appear to be fully expressing itself.
